At the time of the events in question, the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the Barczewo prison. 7.  On 8 January 2011 the applicant\\u2019s grandmother died. On 10 January 2011 the applicant lodged a request with the Director of Prison and the Penitentiary judge for leave to attend her funeral which was to take place on 12 January 2011. Together with his application he submitted a statement from his sister E.K. who confirmed that she would personally collect the applicant from prison and bring him back after the funeral. 8.  On 11 January 2011 the Penitentiary judge of the Olsztyn Regional Court (S\\u0119dzia Penitencjarny S\\u0105du Okr\\u0119gowego w Olsztynie) allowed the applicant to attend the funeral under prison officers\\u2019 escort. The reasoning of the decision read as follows:\\n\\u201cIn view of [the applicant\\u2019s] multiple convictions and his long term of imprisonment there is no guarantee that he will return to prison\\u201d 9.  The applicant refused to attend the funeral, since he believed his appearance under escort of uniformed officers would create a disturbance during the ceremony. 10.  On the same day the applicant lodged an appeal with the Olsztyn Regional Court (S\\u0105d Okr\\u0119gowy) complaining that the compassionate leave was granted under escort and also that he was only allowed to participate in the funeral (not the preceding church service). 11.  On 3 February 2011 the Olsztyn Regional Court upheld the Penitentiary judge\\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The court stressed that the applicant had been allowed to participate in the funeral under prison officers\\u2019 escort. It further noted that the applicant was a habitual offender sentenced to a long term of imprisonment therefore there was no positive criminological prognosis and no guarantee that he would have returned to prison after the ceremony.\", \"claims\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"outcomes\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"case_no\": \"20488/11\"}\n",
    "#ex = {\"facts\": \"4.  The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Oleksandrivka, Kirovograd Region. 5.  On 3 February 2007 the applicant was assaulted. According to the subsequent findings of medical experts, she sustained haematomas on her jaw, shoulder and hip, a bruise under her right eye, concussion, and a displaced rib fracture. The applicant alleges that her assailants were Mr and Mrs K., her daughter\\u2019s former parents-in-law, whereas the domestic authorities found that it was only Mrs K. who had assaulted the applicant. The incident occurred in front of the applicant\\u2019s two-year-old granddaughter. 6.  On 4 February 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint with the police. 7.  On 5 February 2007 a forensic medical expert examined the applicant. He found that she had haematomas which he classified as \\u201cminor bodily injuries\\u201d. 8.  On 14 February 2007 the Oleksandrivka District Police Department (\\u201cthe Oleksandrivka police\\u201d) refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the incident. 9.  On 22 February 2007 a forensic medical examination of the applicant was carried out. The expert found that in addition to the previously noted haematomas, the applicant had also suffered concussion and a displaced rib fracture. The expert classified the injuries as \\u201cbodily harm of medium severity\\u201d. 10.  On 20 March 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor overruled the decision of 14 February 2007 as premature and on 21 March 2007 instituted criminal proceedings in connection with the infliction of bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant. 11.  On 20 May 2007 the investigator suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrator. 12.  On 29 August and 3 October 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor\\u2019s office issued two decisions in which it overruled the investigator\\u2019s decision of 20 May 2007 as premature. 13.  On 6 October 2007 the investigator questioned Mr and Mrs K. 14.  On 1 December 2007 the investigator again suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrator. 15.  On 10 December 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor\\u2019s office, in response to the applicant\\u2019s complaint about the progress of the investigation, asked the Kirovograd Regional Police Department to have the police officers in charge of the investigation disciplined. 16.  On 21 January 2008 the Kirovograd Regional Police Department instructed the Oleksandrivka police to immediately resume the investigation. 17.  On 7 April 2008 the investigator decided to ask a forensic medical expert to determine the degree of gravity of the applicant\\u2019s injuries. On 22 September 2008 the expert drew up a report generally confirming the findings of 22 February 2007. 18.  On 15 May 2008 the Kirovograd Regional Police Department informed the applicant that the police officers in charge of the case had been disciplined for omissions in the investigation. 19.  On 23 October 2008 the Oleksandrivka Court absolved Mrs K. from criminal liability under an amnesty law, on the grounds that she had an elderly mother who was dependent on her. On 24 February 2009 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (\\u201cthe Court of Appeal\\u201d) quashed that judgment, finding no evidence that Mrs K.\\u2019s mother was dependent on her. 20.  On 1 July 2009 the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 21.  On 7 July 2009 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against Mrs K. 22.  On 24 July 2009 the Oleksandrivka Court remitted the case against Mrs K. for further investigation, holding that the applicant had not been informed about the completion of the investigation until 3 July 2009 and had therefore not been given enough time to study the case file. It also held that the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. had contravened the law. 23.  On 13 November 2009 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision of 1 July 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. Subsequently the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 24.  On 21 December 2009 the new round of pre-trial investigation in the case against Mrs K. was completed and another bill of indictment was issued by the Novomyrgorod prosecutor. 25.  On 29 March 2010 the Oleksandrivka Court remitted the case against Mrs K. for further investigation, holding in particular that the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. had been premature, since his role in the incident had not been sufficiently clarified. 26.  On 13 July 2010 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. On 26 May 2011 the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 27.  On 20 December 2011 the Znamyanka Court convicted Mrs K. of inflicting bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant, sentencing her to restriction of liberty for two years, suspended for a one-year probationary period. The court found that the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. in connection with the same incident had been correct. Mrs K., the prosecutor and the applicant appealed. 28.  On 6 March 2012 the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and discontinued the criminal proceedings against Mrs K. as time-barred.\", \"claims\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"outcomes\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"case_no\": \"27454/11\"}\n",

The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Lilienthal in Germany.', '9.  Since 1973 the applicant, her sister M. and their mother S. were the joint owners of a plot of land situated in Bremerhaven. The lease of the plot was managed by a partnership consisting of the applicant, M., S. and a limited company (S company). Partners of the S company were also the applicant, M. and S. Over the years, serious arguments arose between the applicant on one side and her mother and sister on the other side about questions of the proper administration of the partnership, in particular in respect of taxation matters.', '10.  By letter dated 28 March 1986, the applicant filed an action with the Bremen Regional Court (Landgericht Bremen), sitting as a court competent in commercial matters (Kammer für Handelssachen), against S., M. and the S company (hereafter “the defendants”). According to the Government’s submissions – which are contested by the applicant – the Regional Court received the action on 11 June 1986. The applicant asked the Regional Court to prohibit the defendants from excluding her from the management of the business. She also demanded that the defendants surrender all annual accounts since 1973 and that they distribute the net profits accordingly. The applicant alleged that the defendants had failed to consult her about the management. She further complained about mistakes in the management, in particular about the fact that the defendants insisted on paying business taxes without being obliged to do so.', '11.  On 21 July 1986 the applicant’s counsel stated that the applicant was willing to reach a friendly settlement.', '12.  On 30 September 1986, during a first oral hearing, the parties declared that they were willing to reach an understanding and only thereafter hold another hearing.', '13.  On 4 November 1986 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that negotiations on a settlement had not taken place.', '14.  On 20 March 1987, during a further hearing, the Regional Court’s continuing efforts to induce the parties to agree on a friendly settlement failed. However, S. agreed to submit all documents on the annual accounts since 1973 to the applicant’s counsel for inspection.', '15.  On 27 July 1987 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that S. had failed to comply.', '16.  On 11 August 1987 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing which was subsequently postponed on the applicant’s request.', '17.  On 6 November 1987 S. agreed to submit the relevant documents on the annual accounts since 1975 to the applicant’s counsel.', '18.  On 30 December 1987 the Regional Court instructed the defendants to submit the partnership agreements and the annual accounts since 1973 and to disclose the use of the reported profits. It further instructed the applicant to quantify her claims.', '19.  In December 1987 and January and April 1988 the Regional Court called for the case-file of a separate law suit which the applicant conducted against the partnership’s former tax consultant. On 4 February 1988 – according to the Government’s submissions, which are contested by the applicant – the defendants submitted the annual balances and reported on the use of the profits.', '20.  On 15 June 1988 the presiding judge noted that “particularly on emotional grounds, the sensible pursuit of progress in this case” was not possible before a final decision had been reached in the proceedings against the tax consultant.', '21.  On 24 July 1989 the applicant complied with the conditions imposed in the order of 30 December 1987. In September 1989 and January, March, April and May 1990 the Regional Court filed for further information on the proceedings against the tax consultant.', '22.  On 4 September 1998 the Regional Court scheduled a further hearing for 20 October 1989. On 20 October 1989 that court decided to schedule a further hearing only after the tax authority’s decisions on the partnership’s tax liability for the years 1984 to 1986 had become final. On 23 November 1989 the applicant’s counsel informed the court that the tax decisions had become final. On 19 March, 13 June and 6 August 1990 the applicant’s counsel requested the Regional Court to schedule a new oral hearing. On 8 August 1990 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing for 3 September 1990, noting that the delay was owed to the chamber’s excessive workload during the previous six months.', '23.  On 12 October 1990, following the oral hearing, the Regional Court delivered a partial decision ordering the defendants to pay DEM 29,657.58 to the applicant and to grant her a restricted power over the commercial partnership’s bank accounts.', '24.  In a letter directed to the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal, the presiding judge of the Regional Court expressed his regrets of the fact that his attempts to reconcile the parties had failed.\\n(b)  The appeal proceedings against the partial decision of 12 October 1990 before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal', '25.  On 19 November 1990 the defendants lodged an appeal against the Regional Court’s partial decision.', '26.  On 11 April 1991 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal (Hanseatisches Oberlandesgericht in Bremen), having received submissions from both parties, scheduled an oral hearing for 22 August 1991.', '27.  On 27 May 1991 the applicant informed the Court of Appeal that she had changed counsel.', '28.  On 6 June and 17 September 1991 the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing, once following the applicant’s request and a second time because of the rapporteur’s illness.', '29.  On 5 December 1991 the Court of Appeal further postponed the hearing on the ground that the rapporteur had been seconded to the eastern part of Germany.', '30.  On 26 March 1992, following an oral hearing on 5 March 1992, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal quashed the Regional Court’s partial decision and rejected the applicant’s claims.\\n(c)  The continuation of the proceedings before the Bremen Regional Court', '31.  On 23 June 1992 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing for 2 October 1992. On 28 September 1992 and 6 October 1992, following requests from the defendants, the Regional Court postponed the hearing.', '32.  On 17 November 1992 the Regional Court, once again, tried to induce the parties to reach a friendly settlement. On 15 and 18 December 1992 the parties informed the Regional Court that no settlement had been reached.', '33.  On 15 January 1993 the Regional Court ordered the preparation of an expert opinion as to whether the annual accounts for the years 1975 to 1991 of both the commercial partnership and the S company had been prepared in accordance with the rules on accounting and balances. It found that the annual balances did not form a sufficient basis to calculate the applicant’s possible net profit claims.', '34.  On 23 March 1993, upon payment of the advance costs, the Regional Court sent the files to the Chamber of Tax Consultants for the nomination of a suitable expert.', '35.  On 5 April 1993 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that he had relinquished his mandate.', '36.  On 28 April 1993 the Chamber of Tax Consultants named an expert.', '37.  On 29 April 1993 – according to the Government’s submissions – the presiding judge of the Regional Court orally informed the applicant that he would only commission the expert after she had nominated a new counsel.', '38.  On 13 August 1993 the applicant informed the Regional Court that she had mandated new counsel.', '39.  On 27 August 1993 the Regional Court ordered the parties to pay further advance costs.', '40.  On 22 October 1993 the Bremen Regional Court appointed the certified accountant D. to prepare the expert opinion.', '41.  On 19 September 1994, after having received the necessary documents towards the end of 1993, D. submitted his report.', '42.  On 3 March 1995, following the submissions of both parties and requests filed by the defendants to postpone the hearing, the Regional Court held an oral hearing and asked D. to amend his report in view of supplementary documents to be submitted by the defendants.', '43.  On 15 May 1995 the applicant lodged a criminal charge against the defendants for withholding documents, which led to a search of S.’s apartment.', '44.  On 24 May 1995 – according to the Government’s submissions – the Public Prosecutor requested the Regional Court to transmit the case-file. On 28 August 1995 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the parties that he was prevented from pursuing proceedings as the Prosecutor’s Office had not yet returned the case-file.', '45.  On 18 December 1995 the Regional Court asked D. to resume his work on the amendment of his expert report.', '46.  On 8 January 1996 the applicant addressed a letter to the President of the Regional Court, referring to the excessive length of proceedings and requesting that her case be given priority.', '47.  On 7 March 1996 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the parties that he was unable to proceed because the files had not yet returned from the President’s office. On 14 March 1996 the President informed the applicant that he could not find any delay in proceedings attributable to the court.', '48.  On 22 March 1996 the expert informed the Regional Court that the defendants had not submitted all necessary documents.', '49.  On 24 May 1996, during an oral hearing, the defendants stated that they would submit the requested documents at the beginning of June. The Regional Court scheduled a date to proclaim a decision for 30 August 1996.', '50.  On 26 August 1996 the applicant requested the oral hearing to be reopened and announced new applications.', '51.  On 30 August 1996 the Regional Court re-opened proceedings and scheduled a hearing for 13 September 1996. On 25 September 1996, following the defendant’s request of 9 September 1996, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 15 November 1996.', '52.  On 15 November 1996 the Regional Court suggested another friendly settlement and scheduled a final hearing for 29 November 1996.', '53.  On 22 November 1996, following the defendant’s request, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 13 December 1996. Following that hearing the Regional Court announced that it would issue a decision on 31 January 1997.', '54.  On 19 December 1996 the Regional Court received D.’s amended expert opinion.', '55.  On 31 January 1997 the Regional Court ordered the parties to file their comments on the report and scheduled to give a decision on 1 April 1997.', '56.  On 1 April 1997 the Regional Court issued a judgment combined with a judgment on the basis of the cause of action (Grundurteil), concluding that the applicant had effectively revoked the managerial rights of the defendants, that the defendants – in collaboration with the applicant – were obliged to draw up the annual accounts from 1 January 1975 onwards and rejecting the majority of the applicant’s further claims. In his reasoning, the presiding judge noted that the parties conducted their arguments since more than ten years “with consistent stubbornness and with an uncompromising attitude” the like of which he – the presiding judge – had never before experienced in his professional career.\\n(d)  The appeal proceedings against the judgment of 1 April 1997 before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal', '57.  On 5 and 7 May 1997 all parties lodged their appeals. On 18 August 1997, having received submissions from all parties, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal scheduled a hearing for 13 November 1997. On 25 September 1997, following a request by the applicant, the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing to 18 December 1997.', '58.  On 18 December 1997 the Court of Appeal suggested that the parties should seek a separation. At the end of the hearing, following the request of all parties, the court decided that proceedings should only be continued on request of one of the parties.', '59.  On 5 January 1998, following the defendants’ application in a separate proceeding, the Bremerhaven District Court (Amtsgericht) ordered that the piece of land administered by the commercial partnership be sold by compulsory auction with a view to partitioning the property concerned (Teilungsversteigerung).', '60.  On 29 January 1998, following the applicant’s request to continue proceedings, the Court of Appeal scheduled an oral hearing for 23 April 1998 which was later postponed on the defendants’ request to 28 May 1998.', '61.  On 28 May 1998 the Court of Appeal announced its intention to suspend proceedings until the termination of the auction proceedings, against which the applicant protested.', '62.  On 9 July 1998 the Court of Appeal passed an order to suspend the proceedings until a final decision had been reached in the auction proceedings. The Court of Appeal found that the outcome of at least part of the lawsuit depended on the conclusion of these auction proceedings. On 25 February and 31 August 1999 and 7 July and 12 September 2000 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s requests to resume proceedings on the ground that the auction proceedings had not yet been terminated.', '63.  On 18 August 2000 the applicant raised a constitutional complaint. She complained that despite the undue length of the proceedings, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal refused to resume them. She also gave a chronological account of the proceedings and maintained that their excessive length had violated her rights under the Basic Law.', '64.  On 22 November 2000 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant’s complaint.', '65.  On 27 November 2001 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, in separate proceedings, rejected the applicant’s final complaint against the compulsory sale of the plot of land. On this occasion, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal was sitting as the same chamber as in the above mentioned proceedings.', '66.  On 2 November 2004 S. passed away.', '67.  By an undated letter dispatched on 19 November 2004 the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal referred to this Court’s decision on the admissibility of the present complaint and asked the applicant if she wished to pursue the proceedings.', '68.  By letter of 30 November 2004 the applicant insisted that the Court of Appeal was legally obliged to revoke its suspension order of 9 July 1998 before pursuing proceedings.', '69.  On 14 January 2005 the Court of Appeal lifted its suspension order and scheduled an oral hearing for 14 April 2005.', '70.  On 3 May 2005, following the oral hearing, the Court of Appeal suspended the proceedings against S. because of the latter’s death. At the same time, the Court of Appeal issued four pages of legal assessment of the case and invited the parties to submit any comments they would like to make within eight weeks. A new hearing would be scheduled after expiry of this time-limit. The proceedings are still pending before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal.\\n(e)  The sale of the property by auction proceedings', '71.  On 17 July 1998, upon the applicant’s complaint, the Bremerhaven District Court revoked the auction order. On 29 September 1998 this decision was set aside by the Bremen Regional Court; a further appeal was dismissed on 25 November 1998 by the Hanseatic Court of Appeal.', '72.  The applicant’s various further motions aimed at the prevention of the sale of the plot, including a further constitutional complaint, remained unsuccessful.', '73.  On 9 July 2001 the Bremerhaven District Court ordered the auction of the plot of land. It was purchased by M. The applicant’s complaints remained unsuccessful (see paragraph 65 above).'], 'applicants': ['GISELA MULLER'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['56', '81', '86'], '41': ['81']}, 'silver_rationales': [48], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [48], 'explained_indices': [2, 7, 1, 6, 0, 4, 5, 8, 3, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 40, 42, 41, 49, 39, 43, 50, 55, 52, 53, 54, 38, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 51, 37, 32, 35, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 36, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 64, 33, 34, 22, 65], 'explained_distances': [0.33731633, 0.1310234, 0.08860791, 0.07298523, 0.030931532, 0.02787751, 0.023197055, 0.016846657, 0.012208164, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556], 'number_of_sentences': 66, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n",

The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Luduş, Mureş County.', '7.  According to the applicant, on 30 April 2001 his employer, I.N., reported informally to two police officers, N.D. and C.B., that some money had been stolen from his house and that he suspected the applicant of the theft. The two officers rushed to arrest the applicant in the street, handcuffed him in front of other people and then took him to the police station by car. There, the applicant was kept handcuffed and the police agents hit him continuously, forcing him to confess that he had stolen the money.\\nThe applicant signed a confession.', '8.  Afterwards he was taken, still handcuffed, to his parents’ house, where the police agents performed a search. They found 1,000,000 Romanian lei (RON), which they seized and handed over directly to I.N.', '9.  According to the applicant, during the search of the house the two police agents continued to hit him in front of his parents and tried to get him to reveal where the rest of the money was hidden. As he refused to do so, he was taken back to the police station, where he was hit again until I.N. took pity on him and asked the two agents to release him. He then took the applicant back to his house, where he declared in front of those present: “I took Ilie out of the police station and brought him home. He had been so severely beaten by the police that I felt pity for him.”', '10.  On 2 May 2001 following an official complaint about the theft lodged by I.N., the applicant was again taken to the police station, where, it was alleged, the abuse continued.', '11.  On 8 October 2001 the applicant gave a statement before Luduş Police concerning the accusations of theft against him. He retracted his previous confessions and accused the two police officers, N.D. and C.B., of beating and threatening him on 30 April and 2 May to make him confess. He lodged a complaint against them for abuse of position and wrongful arrest without a legal basis.', '12.  On 13 December 2001 the prosecutor attached to the Luduş District Court sent the applicant’s complaint to the Military Prosecutor’s Office at the Târgu-Mureş Military County Court. The complaint was subsequently lodged with the Military Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bucharest Military County Court, to be examined under Article 266 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The said provision prohibits the use of promises, threats or violence to obtain statements from a person under criminal investigation.', '13.  Before the military prosecutor, two witnesses declared that they did not know anything about the case and had not witnessed the events. One witness declared that he had seen the applicant being hit by the police officers and arrested. Another witness, a neighbour who saw the applicant being taken to the police station, declared that one of the police officers had hit the applicant and pushed him into the car like a “bag of potatoes”. The accused police officers and I.N. denied having hit or threatened the applicant.', '14.  On 12 June 2002 the military prosecutor dismissed the criminal complaint against the two police officers.\\nThe prosecutor noted that the applicant did not put forward any medical evidence and considered it “hard to believe that the victim wouldn’t have gone to the forensic doctor, if he had injuries”. He also noted that the applicant had failed to make a complaint against the police officers. The prosecutor lastly noted that the witnesses’ statements were contradictory.\\nHe concluded that it could not be established with certainty whether the police officers had done what they were accused of.', '15.  The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the superior prosecutor. He claimed that only four witnesses had been heard during the investigation, whereas two of the most important witnesses he had put forward – his parents, in front of whom he had been beaten – had not been questioned. He also complained that he or his lawyer had not been allowed to participate in the interviews and had thus had no opportunity to question the witnesses in order to clarify the contradictory statements. He also argued that the local authorities had exercised pressure on the witnesses so they would not reveal the truth about what had happened.', '16.  On 7 July 2003 the applicant was informed by a summary letter that his complaint had been dismissed. The applicant subsequently lodged a judicial complaint against the prosecutor’s decision with the Cluj Military Court.', '17.  Following the demilitarisation of the police by Law no. 218/2002 on the Organisation and Functioning of the Police (“the Police Functions Act 2002”) and Law no. 360/2002 on the Status of Police Officers (“the Police Officers Act 2002”), the case was sent to the Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal which, on 10 September 2004, ruled that the complaint was ill-founded.', '18.  The Court of Appeal based its decision exclusively on the statements given during the criminal investigation, as it refused the applicant’s request for witnesses to be re-examined. It noted the contradiction in evidence, but considered that in the absence of any new written evidence and given the lack of medical evidence, it could not conclude with certainty that the accused had committed the acts in question; it therefore upheld the prosecutor’s decision.', '19.  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing that the lower court should not have relied exclusively on the evidence adduced by the prosecutors, but should have heard witnesses directly and ordered supplementary investigative measures to clarify the contradictory statements.', '20.  On 24 November 2004 the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the appeal and thus upheld the contested decision. It considered that as long as the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending (see paragraph 21 below), it was not possible to undertake parallel criminal investigations against the individuals who had conducted the investigation against the applicant. It further considered the contested decision to be lawful and well founded.', '21.  On 5 November 2002 the applicant was indicted for theft of money from I.N.’s house.', '22.  On 1 March 2005 Luduş District Court acquitted the applicant. In the course of these proceedings, the applicant maintained that the confession signed by him on 30 April 2001 had been made because of violence and pressure inflicted on him by the investigating officers and I.N. The district court found that the house search and the seizure of the money had been unlawful and all the evidence adduced under those circumstances had to be struck from the records. Based on statements from different witnesses, it further held that on 30 April 2001 the applicant had been subjected to acts of violence and that the confession signed by him had been made under duress from the police officers and I.N.\\nThe judgment was upheld by a decision of the Mureş County Court of 3 October 2005 and by a final decision of the Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal of 18 January 2006.', '23.  It also appears from the case file that the money seized from the applicant’s parents’ house was returned to them by virtue of a decision of the prosecutor of 11 June 2002.'], 'applicants': ['ANDREŞAN'], 'defendants': ['ROMANIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['13', '14', '22', '33', '35', '43']}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 8, 16], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 8, 16], 'explained_indices': [2, 0, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 16, 17, 4, 3, 6, 5, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.15767491, 0.101390705, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.05816175, 0.03494391, 0.005631119, 0.0041982234, -0.035952896, -0.0714193], 'number_of_sentences': 18, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n",

The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in the Moscow Region.', \"8.  On 17 July 2002 the applicant privately sent a complaint to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region. He reported on usurpation of a plot of communal land, adjacent to a public street in Iksha, by the private person Ms V. The applicant alleged that Ms A., the head of the Iksha town council, not only had failed to stand up for the rights of other Iksha residents but actively contributed to making the usurpation possible. In particular, Ms A. had allegedly brought about premature retirement of a land surveyor who had objected to the usurpation; she had interfered with the activities of court bailiffs who had come to reclaim the usurped land; she had assisted V. in obtaining title to the land by adverse possession; and she had ostensibly made an exemption for V. from regulations prohibiting planting of vegetables in the protected areas. The letter concluded as follows:\\n“Such outrageous conduct of the appointed (not elected!) head of the town council vis-à-vis the town residents, – in full view of everyone – discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head.\\nI ask you to state your opinion on A.'s anti-social behaviour and assist [us] in returning the land plot into communal use, notwithstanding her opposition...”\", \"9.  On 27 September 2002 Ms A. lodged a civil action against the applicant for refutation of information damaging to her honour and dignity and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. She maintained that the applicant's letter had contained untrue facts and insulting value-judgments, which could have damaged her reputation in the eyes of her hierarchical superiors, thereby causing her non-pecuniary damage.\", \"10.  On 27 January 2003 the Dmitrov Town Court of the Moscow Region granted Ms A.'s defamation action, finding that the applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his allegations contained in the letter of 17 July 2002. Assessing the allegedly insulting value-judgments in the concluding paragraphs of the letter, the court held as follows:\\n“In addition to failing to substantiate the said allegations with any proof, [the applicant] used expressions which, in their form and contents, are not appropriate in respect of an official, which the plaintiff is...\\nAlso, the court considers that the judgments used by the [applicant] in his letter – such as 'A. knows that by law protected areas may not be occupied, but ostensibly makes an exemption for V.', 'such outrageous conduct... discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head', 'A.'s anti-social behaviour' – are not only untrue because the [applicant] failed to prove that these facts had occurred, but also insulting for the Town Council Head; this information, phrased as insults, damages dignity and honour of the plaintiff, and it was sent to a deputy Governor of the Moscow Region, which might have led to belittlement of the plaintiff's authority in the eyes of regional managers...”\", '11.  The court bound the applicant to make a rectification by way of a letter to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region and to pay 300 Russian roubles (EUR 10) to Ms A. for non-pecuniary damage.', '12.  The applicant lodged a statement of appeal, maintaining that his letter had stated his subjective view on the existing problem.', \"13.  On 4 March 2003 the Moscow Regional Court partly upheld, on the applicant's appeal, the judgment of 27 January 2003. It did not analyse the truthfulness of the factual allegations and grounded its judgment on the three expressions quoted above in the last paragraph of the judgment of 27 January 2003. The appeal court struck down the obligation to send a rectification, but upheld the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\"], 'applicants': ['ZAKHAROV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10'], 'violated_articles': ['10'], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['13', '17']}, 'silver_rationales': [6], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.088753045, 0.007991195, -0.031953156, -0.032240808, -0.032240808, -0.032240808, -0.038332403], 'number_of_sentences': 7, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n",

The applicants were born in 1954, 1955, 1986 and 1990, respectively, and live in Budapest.', '5.  The applicants are husband and wife and their son and daughter. In December 1987 the parents travelled to Cuba on a trip organised by a travel agency. On 13 December 1987 the tourist group had dinner at a restaurant where they were served poisonous sea food. As a consequence, the muscles and the nervous systems of the first and the second applicant were seriously damaged which caused 67% disability.', '6.  In 1988 the first applicant brought an action against the travel agency in the Budapest II/III District Court claiming damages. The case was then transferred to the competent Pest Central District Court.', '7.  In an interim judgment (közbenső ítélet), on 23 March 1990 the District Court established the travel agency’s responsibility. After a hearing on 11 June 1993, in a partial judgment (részítélet) of 15 June 1993, it ordered the defendant to pay 600,000 Hungarian forints plus interest to the first applicant, but dismissed his claims for non-pecuniary damage.', '8.  In the continued proceedings, the District Court held hearings on 16 February, 11 May, 23 September and 9 December 1994, 7 July and 6 October 1995, 17 May 1996, and 9 May and 16 July 1997. The Government stated that further hearings took place on 16 January and 17 April 1998.', '9.  On 24 April 1998 the court delivered a decision ordering the defendant to pay damages and an allowance to the first applicant.', '10.  On appeal, on 10 December 1998 the Budapest Regional Court confirmed the first-instance decision. The applicant filed a petition for review on 27 January 1999.', '11.  On 30 March 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the petition. This decision was served on 18 June 2001.', '12.  Meanwhile, on 14 January 1998 all four applicants brought an action in the Pest Central District Court against the travel agency claiming further damages. Subsequently, the case was transferred to the Budapest II/III District Court. On 15 November 1998 the applicants requested in vain that their case be retransferred to the Pest Central District Court in order to facilitate the proceedings.', '13.  The Budapest II/III District Court held hearings on 27 May 1999 and 19 May 2000. On 27 June 2000 it decided to transfer the case to the Buda Central District Court. However, the file was transferred to the Pest Central District Court by mistake. It therefore only reached the Buda Central District Court on 27 September 2000.', '14.  On 28 March 2001 the Buda Central District Court declared its lack of competence and transferred the case to the Budapest Regional Court.', '15.  On 29 June 2001 the Regional Court declared its lack of competence and transferred the file to the Supreme Court for the appropriate delegation.', '16.  On 17 February 2002 the Supreme Court appointed the Buda Central District Court to hear the case.', '17.  On 22 April 2002 the District Court established that the proceedings had been stayed since 28 March 2002 because the summonses could not be served on the plaintiffs.', '18.
