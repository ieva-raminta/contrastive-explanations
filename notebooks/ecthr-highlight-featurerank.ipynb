At the time of the events in question, the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the Barczewo prison. 7.  On 8 January 2011 the applicant\\u2019s grandmother died. On 10 January 2011 the applicant lodged a request with the Director of Prison and the Penitentiary judge for leave to attend her funeral which was to take place on 12 January 2011. Together with his application he submitted a statement from his sister E.K. who confirmed that she would personally collect the applicant from prison and bring him back after the funeral. 8.  On 11 January 2011 the Penitentiary judge of the Olsztyn Regional Court (S\\u0119dzia Penitencjarny S\\u0105du Okr\\u0119gowego w Olsztynie) allowed the applicant to attend the funeral under prison officers\\u2019 escort. The reasoning of the decision read as follows:\\n\\u201cIn view of [the applicant\\u2019s] multiple convictions and his long term of imprisonment there is no guarantee that he will return to prison\\u201d 9.  The applicant refused to attend the funeral, since he believed his appearance under escort of uniformed officers would create a disturbance during the ceremony. 10.  On the same day the applicant lodged an appeal with the Olsztyn Regional Court (S\\u0105d Okr\\u0119gowy) complaining that the compassionate leave was granted under escort and also that he was only allowed to participate in the funeral (not the preceding church service). 11.  On 3 February 2011 the Olsztyn Regional Court upheld the Penitentiary judge\\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The court stressed that the applicant had been allowed to participate in the funeral under prison officers\\u2019 escort. It further noted that the applicant was a habitual offender sentenced to a long term of imprisonment therefore there was no positive criminological prognosis and no guarantee that he would have returned to prison after the ceremony.\", \"claims\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"outcomes\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"case_no\": \"20488/11\"}\n",
    "#ex = {\"facts\": \"4.  The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Oleksandrivka, Kirovograd Region. 5.  On 3 February 2007 the applicant was assaulted. According to the subsequent findings of medical experts, she sustained haematomas on her jaw, shoulder and hip, a bruise under her right eye, concussion, and a displaced rib fracture. The applicant alleges that her assailants were Mr and Mrs K., her daughter\\u2019s former parents-in-law, whereas the domestic authorities found that it was only Mrs K. who had assaulted the applicant. The incident occurred in front of the applicant\\u2019s two-year-old granddaughter. 6.  On 4 February 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint with the police. 7.  On 5 February 2007 a forensic medical expert examined the applicant. He found that she had haematomas which he classified as \\u201cminor bodily injuries\\u201d. 8.  On 14 February 2007 the Oleksandrivka District Police Department (\\u201cthe Oleksandrivka police\\u201d) refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the incident. 9.  On 22 February 2007 a forensic medical examination of the applicant was carried out. The expert found that in addition to the previously noted haematomas, the applicant had also suffered concussion and a displaced rib fracture. The expert classified the injuries as \\u201cbodily harm of medium severity\\u201d. 10.  On 20 March 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor overruled the decision of 14 February 2007 as premature and on 21 March 2007 instituted criminal proceedings in connection with the infliction of bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant. 11.  On 20 May 2007 the investigator suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrator. 12.  On 29 August and 3 October 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor\\u2019s office issued two decisions in which it overruled the investigator\\u2019s decision of 20 May 2007 as premature. 13.  On 6 October 2007 the investigator questioned Mr and Mrs K. 14.  On 1 December 2007 the investigator again suspended the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrator. 15.  On 10 December 2007 the Oleksandrivka prosecutor\\u2019s office, in response to the applicant\\u2019s complaint about the progress of the investigation, asked the Kirovograd Regional Police Department to have the police officers in charge of the investigation disciplined. 16.  On 21 January 2008 the Kirovograd Regional Police Department instructed the Oleksandrivka police to immediately resume the investigation. 17.  On 7 April 2008 the investigator decided to ask a forensic medical expert to determine the degree of gravity of the applicant\\u2019s injuries. On 22 September 2008 the expert drew up a report generally confirming the findings of 22 February 2007. 18.  On 15 May 2008 the Kirovograd Regional Police Department informed the applicant that the police officers in charge of the case had been disciplined for omissions in the investigation. 19.  On 23 October 2008 the Oleksandrivka Court absolved Mrs K. from criminal liability under an amnesty law, on the grounds that she had an elderly mother who was dependent on her. On 24 February 2009 the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (\\u201cthe Court of Appeal\\u201d) quashed that judgment, finding no evidence that Mrs K.\\u2019s mother was dependent on her. 20.  On 1 July 2009 the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 21.  On 7 July 2009 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against Mrs K. 22.  On 24 July 2009 the Oleksandrivka Court remitted the case against Mrs K. for further investigation, holding that the applicant had not been informed about the completion of the investigation until 3 July 2009 and had therefore not been given enough time to study the case file. It also held that the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. had contravened the law. 23.  On 13 November 2009 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision of 1 July 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. Subsequently the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 24.  On 21 December 2009 the new round of pre-trial investigation in the case against Mrs K. was completed and another bill of indictment was issued by the Novomyrgorod prosecutor. 25.  On 29 March 2010 the Oleksandrivka Court remitted the case against Mrs K. for further investigation, holding in particular that the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. had been premature, since his role in the incident had not been sufficiently clarified. 26.  On 13 July 2010 the Novomyrgorod prosecutor quashed the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. On 26 May 2011 the investigator again refused to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. 27.  On 20 December 2011 the Znamyanka Court convicted Mrs K. of inflicting bodily harm of medium severity on the applicant, sentencing her to restriction of liberty for two years, suspended for a one-year probationary period. The court found that the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Mr K. in connection with the same incident had been correct. Mrs K., the prosecutor and the applicant appealed. 28.  On 6 March 2012 the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and discontinued the criminal proceedings against Mrs K. as time-barred.\", \"claims\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"outcomes\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"case_no\": \"27454/11\"}\n",

The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Lilienthal in Germany.', '9.  Since 1973 the applicant, her sister M. and their mother S. were the joint owners of a plot of land situated in Bremerhaven. The lease of the plot was managed by a partnership consisting of the applicant, M., S. and a limited company (S company). Partners of the S company were also the applicant, M. and S. Over the years, serious arguments arose between the applicant on one side and her mother and sister on the other side about questions of the proper administration of the partnership, in particular in respect of taxation matters.', '10.  By letter dated 28 March 1986, the applicant filed an action with the Bremen Regional Court (Landgericht Bremen), sitting as a court competent in commercial matters (Kammer für Handelssachen), against S., M. and the S company (hereafter “the defendants”). According to the Government’s submissions – which are contested by the applicant – the Regional Court received the action on 11 June 1986. The applicant asked the Regional Court to prohibit the defendants from excluding her from the management of the business. She also demanded that the defendants surrender all annual accounts since 1973 and that they distribute the net profits accordingly. The applicant alleged that the defendants had failed to consult her about the management. She further complained about mistakes in the management, in particular about the fact that the defendants insisted on paying business taxes without being obliged to do so.', '11.  On 21 July 1986 the applicant’s counsel stated that the applicant was willing to reach a friendly settlement.', '12.  On 30 September 1986, during a first oral hearing, the parties declared that they were willing to reach an understanding and only thereafter hold another hearing.', '13.  On 4 November 1986 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that negotiations on a settlement had not taken place.', '14.  On 20 March 1987, during a further hearing, the Regional Court’s continuing efforts to induce the parties to agree on a friendly settlement failed. However, S. agreed to submit all documents on the annual accounts since 1973 to the applicant’s counsel for inspection.', '15.  On 27 July 1987 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that S. had failed to comply.', '16.  On 11 August 1987 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing which was subsequently postponed on the applicant’s request.', '17.  On 6 November 1987 S. agreed to submit the relevant documents on the annual accounts since 1975 to the applicant’s counsel.', '18.  On 30 December 1987 the Regional Court instructed the defendants to submit the partnership agreements and the annual accounts since 1973 and to disclose the use of the reported profits. It further instructed the applicant to quantify her claims.', '19.  In December 1987 and January and April 1988 the Regional Court called for the case-file of a separate law suit which the applicant conducted against the partnership’s former tax consultant. On 4 February 1988 – according to the Government’s submissions, which are contested by the applicant – the defendants submitted the annual balances and reported on the use of the profits.', '20.  On 15 June 1988 the presiding judge noted that “particularly on emotional grounds, the sensible pursuit of progress in this case” was not possible before a final decision had been reached in the proceedings against the tax consultant.', '21.  On 24 July 1989 the applicant complied with the conditions imposed in the order of 30 December 1987. In September 1989 and January, March, April and May 1990 the Regional Court filed for further information on the proceedings against the tax consultant.', '22.  On 4 September 1998 the Regional Court scheduled a further hearing for 20 October 1989. On 20 October 1989 that court decided to schedule a further hearing only after the tax authority’s decisions on the partnership’s tax liability for the years 1984 to 1986 had become final. On 23 November 1989 the applicant’s counsel informed the court that the tax decisions had become final. On 19 March, 13 June and 6 August 1990 the applicant’s counsel requested the Regional Court to schedule a new oral hearing. On 8 August 1990 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing for 3 September 1990, noting that the delay was owed to the chamber’s excessive workload during the previous six months.', '23.  On 12 October 1990, following the oral hearing, the Regional Court delivered a partial decision ordering the defendants to pay DEM 29,657.58 to the applicant and to grant her a restricted power over the commercial partnership’s bank accounts.', '24.  In a letter directed to the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal, the presiding judge of the Regional Court expressed his regrets of the fact that his attempts to reconcile the parties had failed.\\n(b)  The appeal proceedings against the partial decision of 12 October 1990 before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal', '25.  On 19 November 1990 the defendants lodged an appeal against the Regional Court’s partial decision.', '26.  On 11 April 1991 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal (Hanseatisches Oberlandesgericht in Bremen), having received submissions from both parties, scheduled an oral hearing for 22 August 1991.', '27.  On 27 May 1991 the applicant informed the Court of Appeal that she had changed counsel.', '28.  On 6 June and 17 September 1991 the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing, once following the applicant’s request and a second time because of the rapporteur’s illness.', '29.  On 5 December 1991 the Court of Appeal further postponed the hearing on the ground that the rapporteur had been seconded to the eastern part of Germany.', '30.  On 26 March 1992, following an oral hearing on 5 March 1992, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal quashed the Regional Court’s partial decision and rejected the applicant’s claims.\\n(c)  The continuation of the proceedings before the Bremen Regional Court', '31.  On 23 June 1992 the Regional Court scheduled an oral hearing for 2 October 1992. On 28 September 1992 and 6 October 1992, following requests from the defendants, the Regional Court postponed the hearing.', '32.  On 17 November 1992 the Regional Court, once again, tried to induce the parties to reach a friendly settlement. On 15 and 18 December 1992 the parties informed the Regional Court that no settlement had been reached.', '33.  On 15 January 1993 the Regional Court ordered the preparation of an expert opinion as to whether the annual accounts for the years 1975 to 1991 of both the commercial partnership and the S company had been prepared in accordance with the rules on accounting and balances. It found that the annual balances did not form a sufficient basis to calculate the applicant’s possible net profit claims.', '34.  On 23 March 1993, upon payment of the advance costs, the Regional Court sent the files to the Chamber of Tax Consultants for the nomination of a suitable expert.', '35.  On 5 April 1993 the applicant’s counsel informed the Regional Court that he had relinquished his mandate.', '36.  On 28 April 1993 the Chamber of Tax Consultants named an expert.', '37.  On 29 April 1993 – according to the Government’s submissions – the presiding judge of the Regional Court orally informed the applicant that he would only commission the expert after she had nominated a new counsel.', '38.  On 13 August 1993 the applicant informed the Regional Court that she had mandated new counsel.', '39.  On 27 August 1993 the Regional Court ordered the parties to pay further advance costs.', '40.  On 22 October 1993 the Bremen Regional Court appointed the certified accountant D. to prepare the expert opinion.', '41.  On 19 September 1994, after having received the necessary documents towards the end of 1993, D. submitted his report.', '42.  On 3 March 1995, following the submissions of both parties and requests filed by the defendants to postpone the hearing, the Regional Court held an oral hearing and asked D. to amend his report in view of supplementary documents to be submitted by the defendants.', '43.  On 15 May 1995 the applicant lodged a criminal charge against the defendants for withholding documents, which led to a search of S.’s apartment.', '44.  On 24 May 1995 – according to the Government’s submissions – the Public Prosecutor requested the Regional Court to transmit the case-file. On 28 August 1995 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the parties that he was prevented from pursuing proceedings as the Prosecutor’s Office had not yet returned the case-file.', '45.  On 18 December 1995 the Regional Court asked D. to resume his work on the amendment of his expert report.', '46.  On 8 January 1996 the applicant addressed a letter to the President of the Regional Court, referring to the excessive length of proceedings and requesting that her case be given priority.', '47.  On 7 March 1996 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the parties that he was unable to proceed because the files had not yet returned from the President’s office. On 14 March 1996 the President informed the applicant that he could not find any delay in proceedings attributable to the court.', '48.  On 22 March 1996 the expert informed the Regional Court that the defendants had not submitted all necessary documents.', '49.  On 24 May 1996, during an oral hearing, the defendants stated that they would submit the requested documents at the beginning of June. The Regional Court scheduled a date to proclaim a decision for 30 August 1996.', '50.  On 26 August 1996 the applicant requested the oral hearing to be reopened and announced new applications.', '51.  On 30 August 1996 the Regional Court re-opened proceedings and scheduled a hearing for 13 September 1996. On 25 September 1996, following the defendant’s request of 9 September 1996, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 15 November 1996.', '52.  On 15 November 1996 the Regional Court suggested another friendly settlement and scheduled a final hearing for 29 November 1996.', '53.  On 22 November 1996, following the defendant’s request, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 13 December 1996. Following that hearing the Regional Court announced that it would issue a decision on 31 January 1997.', '54.  On 19 December 1996 the Regional Court received D.’s amended expert opinion.', '55.  On 31 January 1997 the Regional Court ordered the parties to file their comments on the report and scheduled to give a decision on 1 April 1997.', '56.  On 1 April 1997 the Regional Court issued a judgment combined with a judgment on the basis of the cause of action (Grundurteil), concluding that the applicant had effectively revoked the managerial rights of the defendants, that the defendants – in collaboration with the applicant – were obliged to draw up the annual accounts from 1 January 1975 onwards and rejecting the majority of the applicant’s further claims. In his reasoning, the presiding judge noted that the parties conducted their arguments since more than ten years “with consistent stubbornness and with an uncompromising attitude” the like of which he – the presiding judge – had never before experienced in his professional career.\\n(d)  The appeal proceedings against the judgment of 1 April 1997 before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal', '57.  On 5 and 7 May 1997 all parties lodged their appeals. On 18 August 1997, having received submissions from all parties, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal scheduled a hearing for 13 November 1997. On 25 September 1997, following a request by the applicant, the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing to 18 December 1997.', '58.  On 18 December 1997 the Court of Appeal suggested that the parties should seek a separation. At the end of the hearing, following the request of all parties, the court decided that proceedings should only be continued on request of one of the parties.', '59.  On 5 January 1998, following the defendants’ application in a separate proceeding, the Bremerhaven District Court (Amtsgericht) ordered that the piece of land administered by the commercial partnership be sold by compulsory auction with a view to partitioning the property concerned (Teilungsversteigerung).', '60.  On 29 January 1998, following the applicant’s request to continue proceedings, the Court of Appeal scheduled an oral hearing for 23 April 1998 which was later postponed on the defendants’ request to 28 May 1998.', '61.  On 28 May 1998 the Court of Appeal announced its intention to suspend proceedings until the termination of the auction proceedings, against which the applicant protested.', '62.  On 9 July 1998 the Court of Appeal passed an order to suspend the proceedings until a final decision had been reached in the auction proceedings. The Court of Appeal found that the outcome of at least part of the lawsuit depended on the conclusion of these auction proceedings. On 25 February and 31 August 1999 and 7 July and 12 September 2000 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s requests to resume proceedings on the ground that the auction proceedings had not yet been terminated.', '63.  On 18 August 2000 the applicant raised a constitutional complaint. She complained that despite the undue length of the proceedings, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal refused to resume them. She also gave a chronological account of the proceedings and maintained that their excessive length had violated her rights under the Basic Law.', '64.  On 22 November 2000 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant’s complaint.', '65.  On 27 November 2001 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, in separate proceedings, rejected the applicant’s final complaint against the compulsory sale of the plot of land. On this occasion, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal was sitting as the same chamber as in the above mentioned proceedings.', '66.  On 2 November 2004 S. passed away.', '67.  By an undated letter dispatched on 19 November 2004 the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal referred to this Court’s decision on the admissibility of the present complaint and asked the applicant if she wished to pursue the proceedings.', '68.  By letter of 30 November 2004 the applicant insisted that the Court of Appeal was legally obliged to revoke its suspension order of 9 July 1998 before pursuing proceedings.', '69.  On 14 January 2005 the Court of Appeal lifted its suspension order and scheduled an oral hearing for 14 April 2005.', '70.  On 3 May 2005, following the oral hearing, the Court of Appeal suspended the proceedings against S. because of the latter’s death. At the same time, the Court of Appeal issued four pages of legal assessment of the case and invited the parties to submit any comments they would like to make within eight weeks. A new hearing would be scheduled after expiry of this time-limit. The proceedings are still pending before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal.\\n(e)  The sale of the property by auction proceedings', '71.  On 17 July 1998, upon the applicant’s complaint, the Bremerhaven District Court revoked the auction order. On 29 September 1998 this decision was set aside by the Bremen Regional Court; a further appeal was dismissed on 25 November 1998 by the Hanseatic Court of Appeal.', '72.  The applicant’s various further motions aimed at the prevention of the sale of the plot, including a further constitutional complaint, remained unsuccessful.', '73.  On 9 July 2001 the Bremerhaven District Court ordered the auction of the plot of land. It was purchased by M. The applicant’s complaints remained unsuccessful (see paragraph 65 above).'], 'applicants': ['GISELA MULLER'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['56', '81', '86'], '41': ['81']}, 'silver_rationales': [48], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [48], 'explained_indices': [2, 7, 1, 6, 0, 4, 5, 8, 3, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 40, 42, 41, 49, 39, 43, 50, 55, 52, 53, 54, 38, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 51, 37, 32, 35, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 36, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 64, 33, 34, 22, 65], 'explained_distances': [0.33731633, 0.1310234, 0.08860791, 0.07298523, 0.030931532, 0.02787751, 0.023197055, 0.016846657, 0.012208164, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556, -0.008301556], 'number_of_sentences': 66, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Bursa.', '5.  On 17 October 1996 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of complicity in an armed robbery and homicide in Bursa.', '6.  On 27 October 1996 he was detained on remand.', '7.  On 4 November 1996 the Bursa public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Bursa Assize Court, charging the applicant and three others with the murder of M.T. and armed robbery.', '8.  On 21 November 1997 the Bursa Assize Court acquitted the applicant and two of his co-accused. The fourth accused, A.Ş., was convicted. The first-instance court ordered the applicant’s release from prison.', '9.  The Bursa public prosecutor, M.T.’s father, who had joined the proceedings before the Bursa Assize Court, and A.Ş. appealed.', '10.  On an unspecified date the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebliğname) on the merits of the appeal. This opinion was not served on the applicant.', '11.  On 28 April 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 21 November 1997, holding that the first-instance court had failed to collect certain relevant evidence. The case was remitted to the Bursa Assize Court.', '12.  On 29 June 2001 the Bursa Assize Court once again acquitted the applicant and two of his co-accused after gathering the evidence mentioned in the Court of Cassation’s decision. In its judgment, it held that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant had committed the offences in question.', '13.  The Bursa public prosecutor, M.T.’s father and A.Ş. again appealed. On an unspecified date the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebliğname) on the merits of the appeal. This opinion was not served on the applicant.', '14.  On 19 March 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 29 June 2001.

On 20 August 2002 the court held a hearing and appointed one of its members as judge rapporteur to investigate the case and draft a report. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were duly notified of this hearing. The rapporteur held investigatory sittings between 30 September 2002 and 23 December 2002. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were summoned to be heard by the rapporteur during this time.', '17.  On 24 December 2002 the Bursa Assize Court held a hearing and, relying on the expert report and the documents contained in the case file, awarded the applicant 195,680,000 (TRL) (approximately EUR 116) for pecuniary damage and TRL 3,000,000,000 (approximately EUR 1,791) for non-pecuniary damage. In determining the award of pecuniary damage, the court referred to the minimum wage at the time and the applicant’s loss of income during his incarceration. With respect to non-pecuniary damage, it took into account the applicant’s socio-economic position, the seriousness of the charges brought against him, the time he had spent in detention and the intensity of his emotional suffering. It further awarded the applicant an amount for costs and expenses incurred before the criminal court. However, it dismissed his request for interest running from the date of his release, holding that interest could not be awarded in cases brought under Law no. 466. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were duly notified of this hearing.', '18.  On 31 March and 6 February 2003 the Treasury and the applicant appealed. The applicant complained, inter alia, about the absence of an oral hearing before the Bursa Assize Court and the refusal to fix an interest rate for the compensation awarded to him.', '19.  On 10 June 2003 the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeals. He advised that the judgment of the first-instance court should be quashed as it had failed, inter alia, to take statements from the applicant in person before awarding him compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 2 July 2003 this opinion was served on the applicant.', '20.  On 12 May 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Bursa Assize Court. In its decision the court also noted that there had been no need for an oral hearing in the case.', '21.

On 2 December 1999 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had been drug trafficking.', '7.  On 17 February 2000 the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) decided to prolong the applicant’s pre-trial detention. It found that the strong suspicion against the applicant, the severity of the expected penalty, and the need to secure the proper course of the investigation, justified holding him in detention.', '8.  On 17 May and 6 June 2000 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny), upon an application by the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy), further prolonged the applicant’s pre‑trial detention. It reiterated the original grounds for keeping him in custody and added that the complexity of the case and the large number of co‑accused justified the fear that, once released, the applicant would attempt to influence witnesses or abscond.', '9.  On 17 August 2000 the applicant was indicted before the Wrocław Regional Court.', '10.  On 20 November 2000 the Wrocław Regional Court held a hearing at which it further prolonged the applicant’s detention until 31 January 2001. The court gave the following reasons:\\n“The majority of the adduced evidence has not yet been taken, and it is impossible to do this by 30 November 2000.”', '11.  At the hearing held on 15 January 2001 the trial court again prolonged the applicant’s detention until 31 March 2001 giving the following reasons:\\n“The grounds on which the detention on remand was ordered are still valid. At the same time it is impossible to consider all the evidence before the end of the period for which the detention had been previously prolonged; that is by 31 January 2001.”', '12.  At the hearings on 22 June and 20 August 2001, the Wrocław Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention, repeating the justification given in both previous decisions.', '13.  Subsequently, as the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory time-limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond that term.

At the close of its last hearing in the case, which took place on 10 June 2004, the court, noting the seriousness of the charges against the applicant and his brother, and observing that their counsel had represented them at several hearings, found that the counsel should be paid BGN 200 (equivalent to EUR 102.26) each.', \"11.  On 10 June 2004 the Sofia District Court convicted the applicant and his brother of aggravated rape.

The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Luduş, Mureş County.', '7.  According to the applicant, on 30 April 2001 his employer, I.N., reported informally to two police officers, N.D. and C.B., that some money had been stolen from his house and that he suspected the applicant of the theft. The two officers rushed to arrest the applicant in the street, handcuffed him in front of other people and then took him to the police station by car. There, the applicant was kept handcuffed and the police agents hit him continuously, forcing him to confess that he had stolen the money.\\nThe applicant signed a confession.', '8.  Afterwards he was taken, still handcuffed, to his parents’ house, where the police agents performed a search. They found 1,000,000 Romanian lei (RON), which they seized and handed over directly to I.N.', '9.  According to the applicant, during the search of the house the two police agents continued to hit him in front of his parents and tried to get him to reveal where the rest of the money was hidden. As he refused to do so, he was taken back to the police station, where he was hit again until I.N. took pity on him and asked the two agents to release him. He then took the applicant back to his house, where he declared in front of those present: “I took Ilie out of the police station and brought him home. He had been so severely beaten by the police that I felt pity for him.”', '10.  On 2 May 2001 following an official complaint about the theft lodged by I.N., the applicant was again taken to the police station, where, it was alleged, the abuse continued.', '11.  On 8 October 2001 the applicant gave a statement before Luduş Police concerning the accusations of theft against him. He retracted his previous confessions and accused the two police officers, N.D. and C.B., of beating and threatening him on 30 April and 2 May to make him confess. He lodged a complaint against them for abuse of position and wrongful arrest without a legal basis.', '12.  On 13 December 2001 the prosecutor attached to the Luduş District Court sent the applicant’s complaint to the Military Prosecutor’s Office at the Târgu-Mureş Military County Court. The complaint was subsequently lodged with the Military Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bucharest Military County Court, to be examined under Article 266 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The said provision prohibits the use of promises, threats or violence to obtain statements from a person under criminal investigation.', '13.  Before the military prosecutor, two witnesses declared that they did not know anything about the case and had not witnessed the events. One witness declared that he had seen the applicant being hit by the police officers and arrested. Another witness, a neighbour who saw the applicant being taken to the police station, declared that one of the police officers had hit the applicant and pushed him into the car like a “bag of potatoes”. The accused police officers and I.N. denied having hit or threatened the applicant.', '14.  On 12 June 2002 the military prosecutor dismissed the criminal complaint against the two police officers.\\nThe prosecutor noted that the applicant did not put forward any medical evidence and considered it “hard to believe that the victim wouldn’t have gone to the forensic doctor, if he had injuries”. He also noted that the applicant had failed to make a complaint against the police officers. The prosecutor lastly noted that the witnesses’ statements were contradictory.\\nHe concluded that it could not be established with certainty whether the police officers had done what they were accused of.', '15.  The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the superior prosecutor. He claimed that only four witnesses had been heard during the investigation, whereas two of the most important witnesses he had put forward – his parents, in front of whom he had been beaten – had not been questioned. He also complained that he or his lawyer had not been allowed to participate in the interviews and had thus had no opportunity to question the witnesses in order to clarify the contradictory statements. He also argued that the local authorities had exercised pressure on the witnesses so they would not reveal the truth about what had happened.', '16.  On 7 July 2003 the applicant was informed by a summary letter that his complaint had been dismissed. The applicant subsequently lodged a judicial complaint against the prosecutor’s decision with the Cluj Military Court.', '17.  Following the demilitarisation of the police by Law no. 218/2002 on the Organisation and Functioning of the Police (“the Police Functions Act 2002”) and Law no. 360/2002 on the Status of Police Officers (“the Police Officers Act 2002”), the case was sent to the Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal which, on 10 September 2004, ruled that the complaint was ill-founded.', '18.  The Court of Appeal based its decision exclusively on the statements given during the criminal investigation, as it refused the applicant’s request for witnesses to be re-examined. It noted the contradiction in evidence, but considered that in the absence of any new written evidence and given the lack of medical evidence, it could not conclude with certainty that the accused had committed the acts in question; it therefore upheld the prosecutor’s decision.', '19.  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing that the lower court should not have relied exclusively on the evidence adduced by the prosecutors, but should have heard witnesses directly and ordered supplementary investigative measures to clarify the contradictory statements.', '20.  On 24 November 2004 the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the appeal and thus upheld the contested decision. It considered that as long as the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending (see paragraph 21 below), it was not possible to undertake parallel criminal investigations against the individuals who had conducted the investigation against the applicant. It further considered the contested decision to be lawful and well founded.', '21.  On 5 November 2002 the applicant was indicted for theft of money from I.N.’s house.', '22.  On 1 March 2005 Luduş District Court acquitted the applicant. In the course of these proceedings, the applicant maintained that the confession signed by him on 30 April 2001 had been made because of violence and pressure inflicted on him by the investigating officers and I.N. The district court found that the house search and the seizure of the money had been unlawful and all the evidence adduced under those circumstances had to be struck from the records. Based on statements from different witnesses, it further held that on 30 April 2001 the applicant had been subjected to acts of violence and that the confession signed by him had been made under duress from the police officers and I.N.\\nThe judgment was upheld by a decision of the Mureş County Court of 3 October 2005 and by a final decision of the Târgu-Mureş Court of Appeal of 18 January 2006.', '23.

The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in the Moscow Region.', \"8.  On 17 July 2002 the applicant privately sent a complaint to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region. He reported on usurpation of a plot of communal land, adjacent to a public street in Iksha, by the private person Ms V. The applicant alleged that Ms A., the head of the Iksha town council, not only had failed to stand up for the rights of other Iksha residents but actively contributed to making the usurpation possible. In particular, Ms A. had allegedly brought about premature retirement of a land surveyor who had objected to the usurpation; she had interfered with the activities of court bailiffs who had come to reclaim the usurped land; she had assisted V. in obtaining title to the land by adverse possession; and she had ostensibly made an exemption for V. from regulations prohibiting planting of vegetables in the protected areas. The letter concluded as follows:\\n“Such outrageous conduct of the appointed (not elected!) head of the town council vis-à-vis the town residents, – in full view of everyone – discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head.\\nI ask you to state your opinion on A.'s anti-social behaviour and assist [us] in returning the land plot into communal use, notwithstanding her opposition...”\", \"9.  On 27 September 2002 Ms A. lodged a civil action against the applicant for refutation of information damaging to her honour and dignity and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. She maintained that the applicant's letter had contained untrue facts and insulting value-judgments, which could have damaged her reputation in the eyes of her hierarchical superiors, thereby causing her non-pecuniary damage.\", \"10.  On 27 January 2003 the Dmitrov Town Court of the Moscow Region granted Ms A.'s defamation action, finding that the applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his allegations contained in the letter of 17 July 2002. Assessing the allegedly insulting value-judgments in the concluding paragraphs of the letter, the court held as follows:\\n“In addition to failing to substantiate the said allegations with any proof, [the applicant] used expressions which, in their form and contents, are not appropriate in respect of an official, which the plaintiff is...\\nAlso, the court considers that the judgments used by the [applicant] in his letter – such as 'A. knows that by law protected areas may not be occupied, but ostensibly makes an exemption for V.', 'such outrageous conduct... discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head', 'A.'s anti-social behaviour' – are not only untrue because the [applicant] failed to prove that these facts had occurred, but also insulting for the Town Council Head; this information, phrased as insults, damages dignity and honour of the plaintiff, and it was sent to a deputy Governor of the Moscow Region, which might have led to belittlement of the plaintiff's authority in the eyes of regional managers...”\", '11.  The court bound the applicant to make a rectification by way of a letter to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region and to pay 300 Russian roubles (EUR 10) to Ms A. for non-pecuniary damage.', '12.  The applicant lodged a statement of appeal, maintaining that his letter had stated his subjective view on the existing problem.', \"13.  On 4 March 2003 the Moscow Regional Court partly upheld, on the applicant's appeal, the judgment of 27 January 2003. It did not analyse the truthfulness of the factual allegations and grounded its judgment on the three expressions quoted above in the last paragraph of the judgment of 27 January 2003.

The applicant was born in 1965 and lived, before his arrest, in Lipetsk.', '7.  On 3 February 2004 the Sovetskiy district prosecutor opened an investigation into the murder of a Ms B. An investigator, Mr N., was assigned to take charge of the proceedings.', \"8.  According to the applicant, at about 4 p.m. on 19 February 2004 he came back from work to his flat on Lavochkina Street; his wife and fifteen‑year-old son were at home. His mother and his wife's sister were visiting at the time. At about 7 p.m. four police officers barged into the flat and searched the premises in the presence of two attesting witnesses. The applicant was told that he was a suspect in a murder case; they handcuffed him and took him away in a blue Zhiguli car. Once in the car, an officer punched the applicant in the head and body and then pulled his cap down so that it covered his eyes. After a fifteen-minute ride the applicant was pushed out of the car into the snow. Police officers kicked and punched him, demanding that he tell them about the murder he had allegedly committed. Sometimes the officers took breaks from the beatings and drank vodka. At one point the applicant felt a sharp pain in his left side and realised that his rib had been broken.\", '9.  The applicant further related that at about 10 p.m. he was taken by car to the Sovetskiy district police station. He was taken to the office of Mr Ry., whom the applicant had met before. Another officer, Mr Ro., was also present. Four officers started beating him, demanding that he confess to the murder of Ms B. and reveal where he had hidden her cell phone. Whenever he fainted, they poured water on him. The officers drank alcohol and verbally assaulted the applicant and his relatives. The applicant was beaten with a baseball bat on his shoulders, arms and upper body. He started bleeding and stained the wallpaper with his blood.', \"10.  The beatings continued for two hours. The applicant was then taken into the detention cell within the police station, whereas the police officers left to search the applicant's parents' flat at 40 Let Okryabrya Street.\", '11.  While in the cell, the applicant slit open a vein on his left forearm with a shard of a broken light bulb. His cellmate alerted the wardens. An ambulance arrived and took him to the trauma unit where the doctor sutured the wound. The police officers, who had in the meantime come back from the search, accompanied the applicant. The doctor wanted to X-ray the applicant but the police officers would not let him.', '12.  Upon his return from the trauma unit, the beatings continued in the Sovetskiy district police station. The applicant felt that his ribs were broken on the other side. The officers kicked him in the groin and burned his genitals with a lighter. They took his trousers off, inserted an empty plastic bottle into his anus and took a photo, threatening to show the photo to his cellmates and tell them that he was a homosexual. They also stripped him naked, threw cold water on him and made him stand in front of an open window.', \"13.  The Government submitted copies of two search-and-seizure records dated 19 February 2004. In so far as it can be ascertained, one record concerned the search carried out in the applicant's flat from 6.30 to 7.35 p.m. and the other related to the search of a flat at 40 Let Oktyabrya Street, which lasted from 10.05 to 11.15 p.m. In both records the applicant was listed as having been present during the search; however, the signatures are visibly dissimilar.\", '14.  At about 7 a.m. on 20 February 2004 the applicant agreed to confess. The police officers took him to the investigator Mr N., in charge of the murder case, and told him to write a confession statement. They stayed throughout the time it took the applicant to write the statement and then left once the investigator began to question him as a suspect. When asked by the investigator about the origin of his injuries, the applicant replied that he had been beaten up by unknown persons the day before on his way home.', \"15.  At 10 a.m. the investigator compiled an arrest record concerning the applicant. According to the arrest record, the applicant had been detained at 9.30 a.m. on 20 February 2004 in the prosecutor's office of the Sovetskiy District of Lipetsk.\", '16.  Feeling unwell, the applicant asked the investigator to take him to a doctor. At 5.30 p.m. the applicant was examined by medical specialists who discovered large bruises on his chest, lumbar region, left iliac area, left elbow, head and face. Three ribs were broken on the left side and one rib on the right side.', '17.  The case-file contained a statement, allegedly signed by the applicant on 20 February 2004, in which he indicated that the day before he had been seriously drunk and had been beaten up by unidentified persons on his way home from work.', '18.  Following treatment for his injuries in hospital, on 3 March 2004 the applicant was transferred to a remand prison.', \"19.  On an unspecified date the applicant complained to the prosecutor's office that the statement which he had allegedly written by hand on 20 February 2004 had been a forgery. On 24 February 2005 an investigator with the Pravoberezhniy district police station of Lipetsk asked a graphologist from the Lipetsk Regional Forensic Centre (экспертно‑криминалистический центр УВД Липецкой области) to determine whether or not the statement of 20 February 2004 could have been written by the applicant's hand.\", \"20.  According to the graphologist's report of 10 March 2004, no part of the statement of 20 February 2004 had been written by the applicant. The signature also belonged to another person.\", \"21.  It would appear that on 13 March and 26 May 2006 the investigator refused to open a criminal investigation into the forgery. Both of those decisions were set aside by the Pravoberezhniy district prosecutor. On 18 August 2006 the Pravoberezhniy District Court of Lipetsk granted the applicant's request and ordered the prosecutor to take the necessary procedural measures.\", \"22.  On 6 March 2007 another investigator asked a graphologist from the Ministry of Justice Forensic Centre in the Lipetsk Region to determine whether the statement could have been written by a certain Mr A. On 26 March 2007 the expert replied that the samples of Mr A.'s handwriting provided were of such poor quality as to be unsuitable for forensic examination.\", '23.  According to the Government, on 26 April 2007 the Pravoberezhniy district prosecutor quashed an earlier decision to suspend the proceedings and instructed the investigator to take specific action.', '24.  On 1 April 2004 the applicant, on the advice of his counsel, complained about the ill-treatment described above to the head of the Lipetsk Regional Police. He submitted that he had been unlawfully taken from his home, detained overnight and severely beaten by officers P., D., Z., Ro. and Ry. His complaint was referred to the investigator Mr N. for examination. Counsel for the applicant asked the investigator to arrange a medical examination.', '25.  On 2 April 2004 a medical examination returned the following findings:\\n“3.1.  The forensic medical examination has established that [the applicant] suffered chest injuries in the form of numerous bruises, fractures of the fifth, sixth and ninth ribs on the left side and the eighth rib on the right side, [and] numerous bruises on the head and upper limbs. 3.2. These bodily injuries resulted from the impact of hard blunt objects and could have been caused by blows and kicks on 19 February 2004. 3.3.  The chest injuries are of medium severity, having resulted in a health impairment lasting over a period of more than twenty-one days; the other injuries did not result in any health impairment.”', '26.  On 9 April 2004 the investigator Mr N. questioned the applicant, who described in great detail the ill-treatment inflicted on him by the police officers on the night of 19 and 20 February 2004.', '27.  On 14 April 2004 the investigator questioned Mr P., the head of the criminal investigations department of the Lipetsk police. He confirmed that the police had apprehended the applicant on 19 February 2004. However, he insisted that the applicant had not been beaten or ill-treated while in the police custody and that he had made his confession voluntarily. Officers D., Z., Ro. and Ry. testified in a similar vein.', \"28.  On 28 April 2004 the applicant's wife told the investigator that on 19 February 2004 her husband had had no injuries on his return from work and had not complained about being beaten up by anyone. She had been present during the search of their flat and seen her husband being taken away by the police. The applicant's wife's sister also stated that she had not seen any injuries on the applicant.\", \"29.  On 12 May 2004 counsel for the applicant asked the investigator to identify and examine the applicant's co-workers and factory doctor, his mother, wife and son, their neighbours, who had acted as attesting witnesses, the doctor and nurse from the trauma unit who had been on duty on the night of 19 and 20 February 2004, and the applicant's cellmate. He also requested that the investigator identify whether the actions of the police officers who had held the applicant overnight without registering his detention had been lawful.\", \"30.  On 25 May 2004 the investigator examined Mr Ch., one of the attesting witnesses who had been present during the search of the applicant's flat. He testified that the applicant had had no visible injuries and raised no complaints.\", '31.  The investigator also heard police officer G., who had been the officer-on-duty from 8 a.m. on 19 February to 8 a.m. on 20 February 2004. He stated, in particular, that he did not remember the distinctive features of the man who had been brought in by officers Ry. and Ro. He maintained, nevertheless, that there had been no visible injuries on the man and that he had not received any complaints of ill-treatment.', \"32.  On 26 May 2004 the investigator Mr N. decided not to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant's complaint of ill-treatment. Relying on the policemen's statements, he accepted the version of events according to which the applicant had been beaten up by unidentified persons on the day preceding his arrest. The investigator found as follows:\\n“Thus, the fact that [the applicant's wife's sister] and [the attesting witness] Mr Ch. did not see any injuries on [the applicant] may not prove the fact that there were no bodily injuries on [the applicant] at the moment he was taken away by the policemen, because Mr K., the traumatologist who carried out a cursory examination of [the applicant], did not see any injuries, either, and [the applicant] did not complain to him ...\\nThe investigation concludes that the allegations [of ill-treatment] were raised by [the applicant] for the purpose of avoiding criminal responsibility and punishment for the crime he had committed.”\", \"33.  The applicant contested Mr N.'s decision to a higher prosecutor and to a court of general jurisdiction. He submitted that the inquiry had been superficial, that the investigator had not questioned all the relevant witnesses or collected the material evidence, such as his blood-soaked shirt. Counsel for the applicant maintained, in particular, that the inquiry should not have been entrusted to the same investigator who had examined the criminal charge against the applicant. The court was also asked to identify whether the actions of the police officer-on-duty and his assistant, who had permitted the unacknowledged detention of the applicant, had been lawful.\", \"34.  On 12 August 2004 the Sovetskiy District Court of Lipetsk partly upheld the applicant's complaint and declared the investigator's refusal unlawful. It determined that the investigator had not examined the crime scene, collected material evidence or interviewed the available witnesses. On 21 September 2004 the Lipetsk Regional Court quashed that decision on appeal and remitted the matter.\", \"35.  On 7 October 2004 the Sovetskiy District Court determined that the investigator's decision of 26 May 2004 had been lawful and justified. The investigator had acted within his competence and the applicant had not previously challenged him as lacking independence. The decisions he had taken as to whether to interview witnesses or collect material evidence had been within his discretion as investigator and could not be declared unlawful solely because he had decided that, in the absence of any indication of a criminal offence, those pieces of evidence had not been necessary.\", \"36.  The applicant lodged an appeal. He submitted that although the forensic examination of 2 April 2004 had revealed injuries on his body, the investigator Mr N. had not opened a criminal case, inspected the crime scene or questioned his wife, mother, son, fellow co-workers or medical personnel. The investigator had not established how the document of 20 February 2004 bearing the applicant's forged signature had found its way into the case file. Finally, he had not addressed the issue of his unrecorded detention in the Sovetskiy police station.\", \"37.  On 9 November 2004 the Lipetsk Regional Court upheld the District Court's judgment on appeal. On 27 September 2007 the Presidium of the Lipetsk Regional Court quashed the appeal judgment by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for a new appeal hearing.\", \"38.  On 30 October 2007 the Lipetsk Regional Court issued a new appeal judgment, upholding the District Court's judgment of 7 October 2004 in a summary fashion.\", \"39.  On 11 January 2005 the Sovetskiy District Court of Lipetsk found the applicant guilty of Ms B.'s murder and sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment in a high-security institution. The trial court explicitly refused to examine the issue of whether or not the applicant's confession had been obtained under duress because the Regional Court had already determined that matter in a final judgment of 9 November 2004 (see above). As to the applicant's overnight detention from 19 to 20 February 2004, the District Court held as follows:\\n“It has been reliably established at the hearing that [the applicant] was actually brought into the Sovetskiy district police station in Lipetsk on the night of 19 February 2004 and remained [there] until the moment he was [formally] arrested by the investigator as a suspect. For that reason the court considers it necessary to credit one day, 19 February 2004, towards the period of his detention.”\", \"40.

The date of birth of the fourth applicant is unknown. The applicants live in the village of Arshty in the Sunzhenskiy District of the Republic of Ingushetia. This district borders on the Chechen Republic.', '8.  The facts of the case as submitted by the parties are summarised in section A below (paragraphs 9-60). A description of the documents submitted by the Government is contained in section B below (paragraphs 61-104).', '9.  The first applicant is the mother of Khalid Khatsiyev, born in 1969, and of the third and fourth applicants. The second applicant is the mother of Kazbek Akiyev, born in 1970, and of the fifth and sixth applicants. The seventh applicant was married to Kazbek Akiyev.', '10.  Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev were married and had two and four children respectively. At the material time both men lived in Moscow and went to Arshty in August 2000 to help their families with seasonal agricultural work.', '11.  The facts surrounding the death of the applicants’ two relatives are disputed by the parties.\\n(a)  The applicants’ version', '12.  The applicants did not witness the events described below and the following account is based on eyewitness statements submitted by them.', '13.  In August 2000 the residents of Arshty were cutting grass. The work was done collectively by all villagers in small groups of five to six people.', '14.  On 6 August 2000 about a hundred people divided into small groups were working in the surrounding hills. One of the groups was formed by Khalid Khatsiyev, Kazbek Akiyev, their cousin Ilyas Akiyev, and three men who had come to Arshty as internally displaced persons from Chechnya – Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev, and Aslambek Dishniyev.', '15.  Aslambek Imagamayev stated that while working they had seen several helicopters bombing a forest area near the village of Bamut in Chechnya, about ten kilometres away from them.', '16.  Around 1.00 or 1.30 p.m. the group in which the applicants’ relatives were working had decided to go home for lunch, when two military helicopters appeared from the direction of Bamut and started circling low above the field. Aslambek Imagamayev identified them as MI-24s. One of the helicopters fired a burst from an aircraft machine-gun at a spot situated 40-50 metres from the men. They were scared and, throwing down their scythes, ran to a white Niva car and drove down the hill in the direction of Arshty. Baymurza Aldiyev and Aslambek Imagamayev claimed that the helicopters had flown away but then reappeared and the men saw them right above the car, hovering at low altitude. They stopped the vehicle and ran for cover in different directions.', '17.  The helicopters launched non-guided missiles and strafed the Niva car with aircraft machine-guns with the result that its back tyres were flattened. They then chased the men. One of the helicopters fired a missile at the place where Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev were hiding. They were both killed and Ilias Akiyev, who was nearby, was wounded by shrapnel in his leg.', '18.  Aslambek Imagamayev stated that he had run through the forest to tell the villagers what had happened. He stated that he had heard the helicopters shooting for some time. Baymurza Aldiyev testified that he had run towards the river and had hidden there in a bush. He estimated that the attack on the Niva car had continued for about an hour and a half. After the helicopters had left, he returned to the vehicle and found the bodies of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev about fifty metres away from the car.', '19.  The bodies were taken to the village in the damaged Niva.', '20.  The attack and the deaths were reported by human rights NGOs and the Russian mass-media in August 2000.\\n(b)  The Government’s version', '21.  According to the Government, since the beginning of the counter-terrorist operation within the territory of the Chechen Republic, the civil and military authorities had taken all necessary steps to secure the safety of civilians residing in the North Caucasus. The residents of the Republic of Ingushetia had been notified, through the television and press, of the risk of being at the administrative border with Chechnya as well as of the actions they should perform when in the area of a counter-terrorist operation so as to indicate that they did not belong to illegal armed groups. In particular, once they had established “visual contact” with representatives of the federal forces, residents were supposed to stop moving, mark themselves with a piece of white cloth and wait for the arrival of a group of servicemen for an identity check.', '22.  On 6 August 2000 the authorities carried out a special operation aimed at searching for the base camp, eight kilometres to the south of the village of Arshty, of a group of around 250 illegal fighters, who were to be detained. The operation was planned and commanded by senior officers of the Western Group of the United Group Alignment (Западная группировка войск Объединенной группировки войск). The Government refused to indicate the names of those officers or provide details of the operation, stating that disclosure of the information might be harmful to the State’s national security interests. According to them, “in the materials of the preliminary investigation file there was no information” as to whether the residents of Arshty had been warned in advance about the operation in question, or whether the military personnel involved had been instructed to avoid civilian casualties.', '23.  During the operation, a federal transport MI-8 helicopter was hit by fire from members of illegal armed groups in the vicinity of the village of Arshty and crashed to the ground. Orders were given to evacuate the crew and servicemen on board the helicopter from the site of the crash. The Government alleged, with reference to the findings of the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office, that servicemen who had arrived to evacuate those injured also came under fire from illegal fighters. The airspace above the area of the rescue operation was patrolled in shifts by a pair of military MI-24 helicopters.', '24.  At about 1 p.m., while patrolling over the area situated four kilometres to the west of Arshty and four kilometres from the site of the crash of the MI-8 helicopter, the pilots of the MI-24 helicopters saw a Niva car and a group of at least five men with light machine-guns. In the Government’s submission, the pilots observed the men through a target control system of tenfold magnification, from a distance of two kilometres and at an altitude of 100-150 metres.', '25.  According to the Government, the pilots reported this to the command centre and having received the respective order fired warning shots at a spot situated fifty metres away from the car and the people. The men immediately got into the car and started driving away, instead of staying where they were and waiting for the arrival of ground troops for an identity check. The pilots again reported to their superiors, received the respective order and fired warning shots for the second time, but the car continued moving. In order to prevent the Niva car with unidentified armed men inside from driving further without authorisation in the close vicinity of the zone of the rescue operation, the pilots, pursuant to their superiors’ order, fired at the car with the result that Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev were killed and Ilias Akiyev was wounded.', '26.  The Government also submitted that “there was no information in the materials of the preliminary investigation file” as to whether the attacked men had used the firearms against the pilots, and that “according to its technical description, a light machine-gun [was] ineffective for hitting a target at a distance of over one kilometre”.', '27.  According to the Government, after the rescue operation in respect of the crashed MI-8 helicopter had been completed, the servicemen had inspected the area near the crash site and found a Niva car as well as hand grenades, spent cartridges from light machine-guns and a bloodstained ammunition belt near the car.', '28.  In the evening of 6 August 2000 several officials from the prosecutor’s office of the Sunzhenskiy District (прокуратура Сунженского района – “the Sunzhenskiy Prosecutor’s Office”) and the prosecutor’s office of the Republic of Ingushetia (прокуратура Республики Ингушетия – “the Republican Prosecutor’s Office”) arrived at the scene of the incident. They also brought a forensic expert from the city of Nalchik, in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. The officials questioned the witnesses to the attack, inspected the scene of the incident and collected pieces of shrapnel and damaged scythes. No firearms or ammunition were found at the scene of the incident. The officials also examined the bodies and noted the wounds caused by shrapnel and by large-calibre guns.', '29.  According to the applicants, at the same time the head of the village administration contacted the military authorities. Two armoured personnel carriers with servicemen arrived in the village, and together with some local officials they proceeded to the site, but soon afterwards the local officials returned because the military allegedly refused to proceed further.', '30.  The Government submitted that on 6 August 2000, on the basis of the information received from the Arshty administration, the Republican Prosecutor’s Office had instituted criminal proceedings under Article 105 § 2 (a) and (f) of the Russian Criminal Code (murder of two or more persons committed by a generally dangerous method). The case file was assigned the number 20600055. After the initial investigative measures had been taken, the case was transferred to military prosecutors and given the number 34/32/0189-01.', '31.  According to the applicants, in the absence of any news of the investigation for several weeks after the incident, they applied to the Sunzhenskiy Prosecutor’s Office and then to the Republican Prosecutor’s Office. They were informed that a criminal investigation had been opened on 6 August 2000 and that the case file had been given the number 20600055. In reply to their subsequent requests to the prosecutors at various levels the applicants received hardly any substantive information about the investigation into the attack. On several occasions they received copies of letters by which their requests had been forwarded to different prosecutors’ offices.', '32.  On 29 August 2000 the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office (Главная военная прокуратура), in reply to a request made by a deputy of the State Duma from Ingushetia on the applicants’ behalf, stated that the criminal investigation into the killing of two persons near the village of Arshty had been supervised by the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit (военная прокуратура Северо-Кавказского военного округа) and that he would be informed of any results of the investigation.', '33.  On 30 October 2000 the preliminary investigation into the attack of 6 August 2000 was stayed for failure to identify those responsible. It was then resumed on 13 November 2000 (see paragraphs 69-70 below). It does not appear that the applicants were informed of any of those decisions.', '34.  On 14 November 2000 the applicants were informed by the Republican Prosecutor’s Office that on 9 August 2000 the file in case no. 20600055 had been transferred for investigation to garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 (59 военная прокуратура гарнизона) in Mozdok, North Ossetia.', '35.  On 14 November 2000 a person acting as the applicants’ representative went to Mozdok to find out about the investigation. There he submitted an application stating the facts of the attack and asking for an update on the investigation. An officer of the prosecutor’s office showed him a register of cases, according to which the case had been transferred to a military prosecutor in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia, for further investigation.', '36.  On 15 November 2000 the representative went to Vladikavkaz and talked to the military prosecutor, who informed him that the case had been sent to the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 (военная прокуратура – войсковая часть 20102) based in Khankala, the main Russian military base in Chechnya. On the same day the representative filed a request for an update on the investigation, on the second applicant’s behalf.', '37.  On 24 November 2000 the second applicant wrote to the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102. She stated the facts of the case, referred to the number of the criminal investigation file communicated to her by the Sunzhenskiy Prosecutor’s Office and asked for an update on the investigation. She also requested that she be granted the status of victim in the proceedings. According to the second applicant, she received no reply to that letter.', '38.  On 30 December 2000 the investigating authorities again suspended the investigation on account of failure to identify the alleged perpetrators. It appears that this decision was then quashed by superior prosecutors twice, on 11 March and 24 October 2001 (see paragraphs 72, 73 and 75 below). It does not appear that the applicants were notified of any of those decisions.', '39.  On 29 January 2001 the fourth applicant was informed by the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 that his complaint had been added to the criminal investigation file opened in relation to his brother’s death. The date of the fourth applicant’s complaint was not specified.', '40.  On 30 May 2001 the second applicant wrote to the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 and to the military prosecutor of the North Caucasus Military Circuit. She enquired about developments in the investigation and requested that she and the first applicant be declared victims, in accordance with the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure. She received no reply to those queries, apart from a letter of 21 June 2001 by which the military prosecutor of the North Caucasus Military Circuit informed her that her letter had been forwarded to garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 in Mozdok.', '41.  On 29 August 2001 the civil registration office for the Sunzhenskiy District issued death certificates numbered 376 and 405 for Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev respectively. The date and place of death for both was recorded as 6 August 2000, village of Arshty, Sunzhenskiy District.', '42.  On 15 December 2001 the investigating authorities took a decision by which the criminal proceedings in connection with the events of 6 August 2000 were discontinued in part, as regards the superior officers’ order to attack the Niva car, as there was no evidence of a crime in their actions, and another decision ordering that the criminal proceedings be closed as a whole in the absence of evidence of a crime (see paragraphs 76-77 below). The applicants were informed of these decisions in undated letters (see paragraph 78 below).', '43.  On 25 January 2002 the latter decision of 15 December 2001 was set aside by superior prosecutors and the proceedings resumed (see paragraph 79 below). They were again discontinued owing to the absence of evidence of a crime on 21 March 2002 and then re-opened on 16 August 2002 (see paragraphs 81-82 below).', '44.  On 24 March 2003 the military prosecutor’s office of military unit 20102 informed the applicants that the investigation into the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been resumed.', '45.  By a letter of 17 April 2003 the SRJI, acting on the applicants’ behalf, requested the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 to inform them of the latest development in the case and to grant the status of victim to the first two applicants.', '46.  In a letter of 24 April 2003 the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 informed the applicants that on the same date, with the consent of garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59, the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been discontinued owing to the absence of evidence of a crime in the attack of 6 August 2000.', '47.  According to the Government, that decision had been taken in view of the investigating authorities’ finding that the pilots of the MI-24 helicopters had fired at the Niva car, with the result that the applicants’ two relatives had been killed, pursuant to an order that had been given by the command centre and that had thus been binding on them. Accordingly, the pilots’ action did not constitute a criminal offence. The actions of superior officers who had given the order to destroy the Niva vehicle did not constitute a criminal offence either, given that after the warning shots the car had continued moving in the close vicinity of the counter-terrorist operation in a situation of active armed resistance, with the members of illegal armed groups threatening the lives of federal servicemen and other persons. The Government did not mention the names of the pilots who had participated in the attack of 6 August 2000 or those of their superiors who had given the order in question.', '48.  On 21 May 2003 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 informed the SRJI that the file in the criminal case relating to the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been transferred to the prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit on 9 February 2001 in order to determine which body was competent to carry out the investigation. The prosecutor’s letter referred to case no. 14/33/0429-00.', '49.  On 7 July 2003 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 again replied to a request from the SRJI, stating that case no. 14/33/0429-00 instituted in relation to the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been forwarded to the prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit on 9 February 2001.', '50.  In a letter of 8 July 2003 the SRJI requested garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 to declare the first two applicants to be victims in criminal case no. 14/33/0429-00 and to grant them access to the case file.', '51.  On 10 July 2003 garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 notified the first two applicants in reply to their query that the file of the case concerning the killing of their sons had been sent to the prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment (военная прокуратура Объединенной группы войск) in order to verify whether the decision to discontinue the proceedings had been lawful and well-founded.', '52.  In letters of 10 and 11 August 2003 garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 stated that the first and second applicants respectively could consult the case file in the garrison prosecutor’s office on any working day from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. The letter referred to case file no. 34/32/0189-01D.', '53.  In a letter of 11 August 2003 garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 also informed the SRJI, in reply to their query, that the criminal proceedings in case no. 34/32/0189-01D had been discontinued on 24 April 2003 in the absence of evidence of a crime in the attack of 6 August 2000, and that therefore there were no grounds in domestic law for declaring the first two applicants to be victims of a crime. The letter added that the first two applicants could have access to the case file on any working day between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.', '54.  On 9 March 2004 the SRJI applied on the applicants’ behalf to garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59. They stated that on 29 August 2003 the applicants’ legal counsel had attempted to gain access to the documents in case no. 34/32/0189-01D but this had been refused on the ground that the case file had been transmitted to the military prosecutor’s office of the Republic of Ingushetia (военная прокуратура Республики Ингушетия). In this connection the SRJI requested garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 to notify them of the reasons for the transfer of the case to the military prosecutor’s office of the Republic of Ingushetia and of any new developments in the investigation, together with the date on which, and the place where, the first two applicants and their lawyers could study the case file.', '55.  On the same date the SRJI sent a similar letter to the military prosecutor’s office of the Republic of Ingushetia.', '56.  On 18 March 2004 the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office forwarded the request of the SRJI to the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment for examination.', '57.  In a letter of 23 March 2004 garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 informed the SRJI that the file in criminal case no. 34/32/0189-01D had been referred to the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment for examination and then, after 1 September 2003, to a newly organised military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 04062 (военная прокуратура – войсковая часть 04062) in the Republic of Ingushetia. The letter thus invited the applicants and their representatives to apply to the last mentioned prosecutor’s office.', '58.  On 2 June 2004 garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 stated that they had replied to all the queries from the SRJI in a letter of 23 March 2004.', '59.  On 2 July 2004 the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment informed the first two applicants and the SRJI that the criminal proceedings in case no. 34/32/0189-01D had been discontinued on 24 April 2003 and that no subsequent investigative measures had been taken. The military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment had studied the case materials and found the aforementioned decision of 24 April 2003 to have been substantiated. The case file had then been forwarded to the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 04062 and the applicants could consult the file there.', '60.  According to the applicants, all their efforts to gain access to the case file have so far proved unsuccessful. On the latest occasion they attempted to consult the case file in December 2006, but in vain.', '61.  In October 2004, at the communication stage, the Government were invited to produce a copy of the investigation file in the criminal case instituted in connection with the attack of 6 August 2000 and the killing of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government refused to submit any documents from the criminal investigation file, stating that, even though the investigation had been discontinued, the disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses.', '62.  On 23 October 2006 the application was declared admissible. At that stage the Court again invited the Government to submit the investigation file. In February 2007 the Government agreed to reveal the case-file materials, apart from documents “the disclosure of which [might] be harmful to the interests of the security of the Russian Federation and of the participants in the criminal proceedings” and those “which were irrelevant to the investigation”. According to the Government, the submission of the case file at an earlier stage had been inappropriate in view of the need to secure the safety of the participants in the criminal proceedings and to ensure that the information from the preliminary investigation was not disclosed, in accordance with Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure as well as on account of the applicants’ failure to exhaust available domestic remedies.', '63.  Eventually, the Government produced a number of documents running to a total of 223 pages. They can be summarised as follows.\\n(a)  Documents relating to the conduct of the investigation and informing the applicants of its progress', '64.  By a decision of 6 August 2000 the prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District ordered that criminal proceedings under Article 105 § 2 (a) and (f) of the Russian Criminal Code (murder of two or more persons committed by a generally dangerous method) be instituted in connection with an attack by two military helicopters earlier that day which had resulted in the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev.', '65.  By a decision of 6 August 2000 the investigator in charge took up the case. In another decision taken on the same date the investigator in charge granted the status of victim of a crime to Ilyas Akiyev, who had sustained injuries as a result of the attack (see paragraphs 17 and 25 above).', '66.  In a decision of 8 August 2000 the investigator in charge ordered that the case file be transferred to a military prosecutor’s office, which had jurisdiction to investigate criminal offences committed by military personnel.', '67.  By a decision of 18 September 2000 an investigator of the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 took up the case, which was given the number 14/33/0429-2000.', '68.  A decision of 2 October 2000 taken by the investigator in charge and approved by the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 ordered that the term of the preliminary investigation should be extended until 6 November 2000. The decision stated, in particular, that it had been established that on 6 August 2000 at about 9 a.m. the applicants’ two relatives, together with Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev and Aslambek Dishniyev, had arrived in a Niva car at an area three kilometres to the west of Arshty for grass-cutting. The decision then continued:\\n“At about 11 a.m. two military MI-24 helicopters appeared over the territory of the Chechen Republic to the south of the village of Arshty and started strafing the territory of the Chechen Republic. At about 1.30 p.m. [the applicants’ two relatives and the four other persons mentioned above] got into the [Niva] car and attempted to drive off in the direction of the village of Arshty. At the same time the helicopters ... moved in their direction and opened fire on the car from aircraft machine-guns. [The applicants’ two relatives and the four others mentioned above] left the car and went into hiding in grass nearby. The helicopters went on strafing the vehicle and [the six persons’] hiding-place from missile launchers and aircraft machine-guns. As a result of the attack Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev died.”\\nThe report then listed the investigative actions that had been carried out. It stated, in particular, that the scene of the incident had been inspected and craters and metallic pieces of shrapnel with markings had been found, that the corpses of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been examined and then sent to the Forensic Examinations Office of the Republic of Ingushetia for a forensic examination, and that Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev, Aslambek Dishniyev and F., who had been present at the scene of the incident on the date of the attack, had been questioned as witnesses. The decision also prescribed that further investigative measures be taken. It ordered that the identity of the pilots of the two MI-24 helicopters be established and that they be questioned, that the identity of the persons who had ordered the pilots to open fire be established and that those persons be charged with a criminal offence, and that other investigative measures necessary to complete the investigation be carried out.', '69.  By a decision of 30 October 2000 the investigator in charge of the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 suspended the proceedings in case no. 14/33/0429-2000. The decision restated the facts of the incident and listed the investigative actions that had been conducted, in the same manner as this had been stated in the decision of 2 October 2000. It went on to say the following:\\n“A witness questioned in the course of the investigation, Lieutenant Colonel K., the head of the headquarters of the aircraft division of a [deleted] military unit, confirmed the fact of the attack on the Niva vehicle by helicopters of a [deleted] separate helicopter squadron in the vicinity of the village of Arshty. It follows from Lieutenant Colonel K.’s statement that at present the [deleted] separate helicopter squadron had been transferred from the territory of the Chechen Republic to the place of its permanent station in the city of [deleted].\\nTaking into account that the alleged perpetrator has not been identified, despite all the measures taken, that all the investigative measures which could have been carried out within the territory of the Chechen Republic have been taken and that the personnel of the [deleted] separate helicopter squadron have left for the place of their permanent station in the town of [deleted] ... the investigation should be carried out [at that place] in the town of [deleted].\\nThe decision thus ordered that the criminal proceedings be suspended, as it was impossible to establish the identity of those responsible, and that the case file be transmitted to the military prosecutor’s office of the Kursk garrison.', '70.  In a decision of 13 November 2000 the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit quashed the decision of 30 October 2000, stating that the investigation had been incomplete and ordering that the case be sent to the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 for additional investigation.', '71.  By a decision of 30 November 2000 an investigator of the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 took up the case.', '72.  A decision of 30 December 2000 ordered that the criminal proceedings in case no. 14/33/0429-2000 be stayed. It was, in essence, similar to the decision of 30 October 2000, but stated in addition the following:\\n“A witness questioned in the course of the investigation, [deleted] L., stated that on 6 August 2000 illegal fighters had attacked a [federal air] group in the vicinity of the village of Arshty. A MI-8 helicopter [was hit as a result of the attack] and fell to the west from Arshty...A search group, together with MI-24 helicopters for fire support, was sent to the site of the crash. Thereafter the pilots of the helicopters reported that they had destroyed a Niva vehicle from which illegal fighters had been firing at the helicopters. [Witness L.] was not asked for permission to open fire on the Niva vehicle. As a result of inspection [by federal servicemen] of an area in the vicinity of Arshty, a damaged Niva vehicle, hand grenades, spent cartridges from machine-guns cases and a bloodstained ammunition belt were found”.\\nThe decision then concluded that the identity of those responsible could not be established and ordered that the proceedings be suspended.', '73.  In a decision of 11 March 2001 the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit set aside the decision of 30 December 2000, stating as follows:\\n“An examination of the materials of the criminal case has established that the investigation was becoming procrastinated, that no practical measures aimed at establishing the identity of those responsible were being taken, that special requests were being met, with the result that it is now difficult to assess the actions or omissions of public officials and pilots of the helicopters’ crew, who have not been questioned to date. Until the present time no forensic examination of the dead bodies has been carried out, and therefore the cause of death has not been established and the question of the damage sustained by [those who were declared victims in the proceedings] has not been resolved.”\\nThe military prosecutor’s office thus ordered that the decision of 30 December 2000 be quashed, that the proceedings in case no. 14/03/0396-00 instituted in connection with the murder of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev be resumed and that the case file be forwarded to garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 for additional investigation.', '74.  By a decision of 24 August 2001 an investigator of the garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 took up the case, referring to file number 14/32/0189-01D.', '75.  A decision of the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit dated 24 October 2001 again quashed the decision of 30 December 2001 and ordered the re-opening of the investigation in case no. 14/21/0396-00 concerning the murder of the applicants’ relatives. It set out the same reasons as the decision of 11 March 2001.', '76.  In a decision of 15 December 2001 the investigator in charge of garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 ordered that the criminal proceedings in case no. 14/32/0189-01D concerning the murder of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev be closed in part. The decision stated as follows:\\n“On 6 August 2000 at about 9 a.m. a MI-8 helicopter of a [deleted] separate helicopter squadron fell down in the vicinity of the village of Arshty of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Republic of Ingushetia. A helicopter which arrived at the site of the crash for the evacuation of the injured servicemen was also attacked by fire. On the same day at 12 noon, pursuant to an order of Colonel D., the commander of military unit no. 06652, two MI-24 helicopters under the command of Major [the real name is replaced with the nickname “Ivanov”] and Major [the real name is replaced with the nickname “Petrov”] were sent to cover the rescue operation. At about 1 p.m., while patrolling over the area to the west of Arshty, they saw a white [Niva] vehicle and five [rather than six] persons armed with automatic firearms standing nearby, and immediately reported this to the command centre of the United Group Alignment in the village of Khankala of the Chechen Republic. The helicopter[s] [were] at an altitude of 100-150 metres and at a distance of two kilometres from the car. [The pilots] observed the car through a target control system of tenfold magnification. The command centre reported that the identity of those persons would be established. About 15 minutes later the command centre gave an order to destroy the vehicle. Then [the pilots] fired a warning shot from a gun at a spot situated fifty metres away from the car with the purpose of warning everybody to stay where they were until the arrival of ground troops. After the warning shot, the people got into the car and started driving in the direction of the village of Arshty. [The pilots] reported to the command centre and received a repeated order to destroy the vehicle. Following the order, [the pilots] again fired a warning burst from an aircraft machine-gun. The car continued to advance. Thereafter, the third burst for effect was fired from the helicopter under the command of Major [“Ivanov”] after which the car stopped. This was reported to the command centre and to the ground troops... As a result of the attack Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev died.\\nAccordingly, there is nominal evidence of a criminal offence punishable under Article 286 (3) of the Russian Criminal Code [aggravated abuse of power] in the actions of an official who ordered the destruction of the [Niva] vehicle. However, [this] order was justified in the aforementioned circumstances, and therefore the criminal proceedings in the part concerning the criminal offence under Article 286 (3) of the Russian Criminal Code should be terminated [owing to the absence of evidence of a criminal in that official’s actions ...]”', '77.  Another decision taken by the same investigator on 15 December 2001 ordered that the criminal proceedings instituted concerning the murder of the applicants’ two relatives be discontinued in full. The decision described the circumstances of the attack of 6 August 2000 as they were stated in the aforementioned decision of 15 December 2001 and referred to a report on the inspection of the scene of the incident of 6 August 2000, the reports on the forensic examination of the dead bodies of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev dated 3 September 2001 and witness statements of Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev and Aslambek Dishniyev, those of the pilots of the MI-24 helicopters, those of Colonel D., the commander of military unit no. 06652, and those of Lieutenant Colonel A., the head of the headquarters of military unit [the number of the unit is deleted] as well as to the other decision of 15 December 2001. It then concluded:\\n“Accordingly, on the basis of the evidence obtained during the investigation, it has been established that on 6 August 2000 at about 1 p.m. in the vicinity of the village of Arshty ... the members of the crew of the MI-24 helicopters destroyed the [Niva] vehicle pursuant to an order which was justified in the circumstances and was binding on them, and therefore their actions did not constitute a criminal offence and they are not liable to criminal responsibility for the damage inflicted by their actions. The criminal case instituted on 6 August 2000 under 105 § 2 (a) and (f) of the Russian Criminal Code shall be terminated ... in the absence of evidence of a crime.”', '78.  In undated letters the investigating authorities informed the applicants, Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev and Aslambek Dishniyev that the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the attack of 6 August 2000 and the murder of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev had been suspended on 15 December 2001 owing to the absence of evidence of a crime. The applicants were informed that the decision could be appealed against to the prosecutor of garrison no. 59 or before a court.', '79.  By a decision of 25 January 2002 the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit set aside the second decision of 15 December 2001 (see paragraph 77 above), stating that the preliminary investigation had been incomplete, that the special instructions had not been complied with, and that all the measures envisaged in the law had not been taken, with the result that it was difficult to assess the actions or omissions of the public officials and the members of the crew of the MI-24 helicopters. The decision thus ordered that the investigation be resumed.', '80.  On 21 February 2002 an investigator of garrison prosecutor’s office no. 59 took up the case.', '81.  In letters of 22 March 2002 the investigator in charge informed the second applicant’s family, as well as Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev and Aslambek Dishniyev, that on 21 March 2002 the proceedings in connection with the death of the applicants’ two relatives had been discontinued in the absence of evidence of a crime, and that this decision could be appealed against to the prosecutor of garrison no. 59 or in court. It is unclear whether the first applicant’s family was informed of the decision of 21 March 2002, as there is no letter to that effect among the documents submitted by the Government. A copy of the decision of 21 March 2002 was not submitted to the Court either.', '82.  By a decision of 16 August 2002 the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit quashed the decision of 21 March 2002, stating that the investigation had been incomplete, that a superior prosecutor’s instructions had not been complied with and that all the measures envisaged in the law had not been taken to establish the circumstances of the case.', '83.  By a decision of 24 March 2003 an investigator of the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 took up the case.', '84.  On the same date the investigator in charge informed the second applicant’s family and the aforementioned four men who had been attacked together with Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev of the decision of 24 March 2003. It is unclear whether the first applicant’s family was informed of the said decision, as there is no letter to that effect among the documents submitted by the Government.', '85.  A decision of 24 April 2003 taken by the investigator in charge of the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 ordered that the criminal proceedings in case no. 34/32/0189-01 be terminated. The decision described the circumstances of the attack of 6 August 2000 as they had been stated in the decision of 15 December 2001 on complete termination of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 77) and referred to the same documents as those relied on in that decision. It also referred to the witness statement of Mr F., the head of the administration of Arshty at the relevant period, that of Mr M., the head of the flight safety service, and the report of a military expert of 20 March 2002 (see paragraph 102 below). The decision then stated that all the investigative actions aimed at establishing fully and objectively the circumstances of the case had been carried out and that it had been established that at the relevant period a counter-terrorist operation had been underway within the territory of the North Caucasus region, which comprised several republics, including the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Ingushetia. The residents of the region had been notified that once approached by military vehicles or federal servicemen they were to mark themselves with a piece of white cloth so as to indicate that they were civilians and wait for the arrival of servicemen for an identity check. The decision went on to say that on 6 August 2000 the applicants’ two relatives and the four other men, who had been discovered in the vicinity of Arshty by two MI-24 helicopters under the command of Major “Ivanov” and Major “Petrov”, had failed to comply with the aforementioned requirements and, after a warning shot, had attempted to escape in the Niva car with the result that the MI-24 helicopters had opened fire for effect, entailing the death of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev. The decision then concluded that the pilots had acted pursuant to an order which had been justified in the circumstances and had been binding on them, and therefore their actions did not constitute a criminal offence and they were not responsible for the damage caused. It thus ordered that the criminal proceedings against officers “Ivanov” and “Petrov” be discontinued in the absence of evidence of a crime in their actions.\\n(b)  Transcripts of witness interviews', '86.  There are a number of transcripts of witness interviews among the documents submitted by the Government. In particular, Ilyas Akiyev, Baymurza Aldiyev, Aslambek Imagamayev and Aslambek Dishniyev described the attack of 6 August 2000 as stated in the applicant’s version of events (see paragraphs 12-20) and insisted that they had had no firearms and that it had been obvious that they had been civilians cutting grass and had posed no danger. Aslambek Dishiyev and Aslambek Imagamayev also stated that they had never received any information concerning the rules of conduct of civilians in the zone of a counter-terrorist operation, that it had never been explained how a civilian should mark himself, as no special operations had been carried out in Ingushetia. Baymurza Aldiyev submitted that the head of the administration of Arshty and officers of the Department of the Interior of the Sunzhenskiy District had explained to the local residents that they should avoid the military personnel, not approach and not provoke them. He had heard from his relatives that when federal servicemen opened fire it was necessary to mark oneself as a civilian with a piece of white cloth and wait for the arrival of servicemen for an identity check, but during the attack of 6 August 2000 he had not performed those actions, as they had all been scared and attempted to escape, fearing for their lives.', '87.  Mr F., the head of the administration of Arshty at the material time, stated that Khalid Khatsiyev and Khalid Akiyev had never been involved in illegal activities, and no criminal proceedings had ever been brought against them. He also submitted that on 6 August 2000 he had visited the scene of the incident with the Niva car, together with local law-enforcement officers. According to Mr F., during the inspection of the scene of the incident pieces of shrapnel and craters from shells and bullets had been found. Mr F. claimed that there had been no firearms or grenades at the scene of the incident, that it had not been attended by servicemen or any persons before the arrival of the law-enforcement officers and that there had been no traces of anyone’s prior presence at the scene. Mr F. also stated as follows:\\n“Since the summer of 2000 a counter-terrorist operation has been underway within the territory of the Chechen Republic. From that time onwards the federal forces have repeatedly conducted special operations in the village of Arshty, during which representatives of official bodies or commanding officers have never explained the rules of conduct in a situation when representatives of the federal forces approach. I, myself, have on several occasions told the residents of the village that if military vehicles, aircraft or armed soldiers appear they should move away to a safe distance.\\nDuring the year 2000 it was never explained to me that on the approach of aircraft or helicopters it was necessary for people to mark themselves as civilians – with a white cloth or in any other way – to make the servicemen understand that they are civilians. Accordingly, I never gave such explanations to the residents of the village.\\nThe officials of the Department of the Interior of the Sunzhenskiy District did not give [any such explanations] either, since there were no military actions on the territory of the Republic of Ingushetia...”', '88.  According to a statement of a superior officer of the air force obtained on 30 November 2000, in case of necessity the pilot in command of a helicopter might be authorised by the command centre to take, of his own motion, a decision to open fire.', '89.  Officer L., whose military rank and position are unknown as his personal details have been deleted from the transcript, stated during the questioning of 29 December 2000 that:\\n“...the pilots reported that they had destroyed a Niva vehicle with illegal fighters, who had been firing at the helicopters. The pilots did not request me to give them authorisation to open fire. I suppose that the pilot in command, of his own motion, took a decision to destroy the Niva car, having assessed the battle conditions. After the rescue operation had been completed, the area in the vicinity of the crash was inspected. As a result, a destroyed Niva vehicle was found and several hand-grenades, spent cartridges from light machine-guns and a bloodstained ammunition belt were found nearby.”', '90.  Lieutenant Colonel A., whose position is unknown as his personal details have been deleted from the transcript, stated during questioning on 6 May 2001 that it was he who, on 6 August 2000, had assigned a mission to a group consisting of the MI-8 helicopter, which had then been hit by the rebel fighters, and two MI-24 helicopters, which had been entrusted with the task of “covering” the MI-8 helicopter. He stated that this group had not been involved in an attack on the Niva car and that he had no information regarding the attack.', '91.  According to a statement of 23 April 2001 by Mr I., an investigator from the Sunzhenskiy Prosecutor’s Office, he had been summoned to the scene of the incident with the Niva car on 6 August 2000. When he arrived, the destroyed vehicle and the dead bodies had already been removed from the site. Mr I. had inspected the site and found fragments of shrapnel, pieces of broken car headlights and bloodstains. According to him, he had found no grenades, spent cartridges from light machine-guns or an ammunition belt.', '92.  Mr B., who at the material time had been a driver for the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Ingushetia and had attended the scene of the incident as an attesting witness on 6 August 2000, stated during questioning on 23 April 2001 that he had seen a severely damaged Niva car, two dead bodies lying 12-15 metres away and a lot of craters and pieces of shrapnel. Mr B. submitted that he had seen an F-1 hand grenade lying between the vehicle and one of the corpses. According to him, he had not seen any firearms, spent cartridges from light machine-guns or ammunition belts at the scene of the incident; near the corpses Mr B. had only seen scythes.', '93.  The pilots of the two Mi-24 helicopters who had attacked the Niva car on 6 August 2000 were questioned on 22 and 23 January 2001 respectively. The real names, surnames and personal details of the pilots have been deleted from the transcripts of their interviews. The pilots in command of the helicopters are indicated with the nicknames “Ivanov” and “Petrov” and an operating pilot who was working in tandem with “Ivanov” is indicated as “Sidorov”.', '94.  Witness “Ivanov” submitted that he had participated in a rescue operation of 6 August 2000 as pilot in command of the lead helicopter of a pair of MI-24 helicopters. The mission was assigned to them by the commander of military unit no. 06652, who received orders from the command centre of the main federal military base in the village of Khankala, the Chechen Republic. According to “Ivanov”, at about 1 p.m. he noticed a white Niva car and five [rather than six] men standing nearby, all of whom had automatic firearms. He observed the people without using any optical devices from the distance of two kilometres and altitude of 100-150 metres, but insisted that he clearly saw the people had firearms, and that his operating pilot, “Sidorov”, had seen them through a target control system of tenfold magnification. He reported this to the command centre in Khankala and was told that the identity of those five persons would be established. The pilots continued observing, the Niva vehicle remained still and the five men were moving around it. About 15 minutes later “Ivanov” received an order from the command centre in Khankala to destroy the car. According to him, he did not know the name of the official who had given the order. “Ivanov” then sought and obtained confirmation of that order. He fired a warning shot at a spot situated fifty metres away from the car, so as to make the people stand still and wait for the arrival of federal servicemen for an identity check. After the shot, the people got into the car and drove off in the direction of Arshty. “Ivanov” reported this to the command centre in Khankala and received an order to destroy the vehicle. He then fired a warning burst from an aircraft machine-gun, but the car carried on moving. “Ivanov” fired another burst and hit the Niva vehicle, which stopped but nobody got out of it. “Ivanov” then reported the incident to his superiors and left for the place of his station, as he was running out of fuel. “Ivanov” insisted that he did not know the names or military ranks of officials who had given him orders and had had no doubt that the five men belonged to illegal armed groups, as they had been armed. He submitted that “the people in the [Niva] car were supposed to stop after a warning shot; this was known to all the civilian population in the area of the military actions”.', '95.  Witness “Petrov” stated that he had participated in a rescue operation on 6 August 2000 as wingman of the pair of MI-24 helicopters. He confirmed that he had seen from a distance of two kilometres a white Niva car and five [rather than six] armed men, who after “Ivanov’s” warning shot had got into the car and started driving away, although “everybody knew that a car must stop at a shot or even a helicopter’s flight”. “Petrov” submitted that he had not been authorised to communicate with the command centre but had heard “Ivanov’s” communications and confirmed that “Ivanov” had reported about the car and the people to the command centre and twice received an order to destroy the vehicle. After the second order from the command centre “Ivanov” had given “Petrov” a command to fire at the vehicle, and the latter had strafed the vehicle with a machine-gun of 12.7 mm calibre, whilst “Ivanov” had fired at it with an automatic cannon of 30 mm calibre. The car had stopped but nobody had got out. He then left for the place of his location, as he was running out of fuel. “Petrov” stated that he did not know the names or military ranks of the officials who had communicated with “Ivanov” on 6 August 2000.', '96.  Witness “Sidorov” stated that on 6 August 2000 he had been an operating pilot on the MI-24 helicopter under the command of “Ivanov”, and that he had observed a Niva car and five [rather than six] men with automatic firearms standing nearby through a target control system of tenfold magnification, as he had reported to “Ivanov”. He then submitted the following:\\n“I clearly heard Major [“Ivanov”] report about the car to [deleted] and to [deleted]. About 10 minutes later an order followed from [deleted] (Khankala) to fire a warning shot. “Ivanov” fired a warning shot from an automatic cannon in front of the car. The people got into the vehicle and drove off in the direction of the village of Arshty and did not stop. All local inhabitants know that it is necessary to stop. [“Ivanov”] reported to [deleted] that the car had not stopped. An order to fire another warning shot followed. [“Ivanov”] made another circle and fired in front of the car with the automatic cannon, but the car did not stop. [“Ivanov”] reported to [deleted] about the situation with the car. An order followed to open fire for effect. [“Ivanov”] opened fire for effect, and the car stopped and I saw two persons get out and run into the forest. [“Ivanov”] reported to [the command centre] that the car had stopped and thereafter he transmitted to [deleted] the information on the car’s location to enable an identity check of the people in the car.”', '97.  During questioning on 23 January 2001 Colonel D. submitted that at the material time he had been the commander of the [deleted] separate helicopter squadron and that on 6 August 2000 he had heard communications between the MI-24 helicopters and the command centre. He confirmed that the pilots had reported about the Niva vehicle and armed men nearby, that they had been ordered to fire a warning shot, that the pilots had reported that the men had got into the car and attempted to escape and that the pilots had been ordered to destroy the vehicle.', '98.  Officer M., a military expert, stated during an interview of 20 April 2003 that the actions of the pilots of the MI-24 helicopters, who had attacked the group of people on 6 August 2000, had fully complied with relevant military regulations and the provisions of international law and had been justified in the circumstances. The expert admitted that the pilots could have mistaken agricultural equipment, in particular scythes, for firearms, but noted that the pilots had been absolutely positive that the men whom they had noticed had been armed and that those men had not marked themselves as civilians and had attempted to escape.\\n(c)  Documents relating to investigative actions', '99.  A report on the inspection of the scene of the incident of 6 August 2000 attested the presence of a large number of craters and metallic fragments of irregular shape as well as pieces of broken glass from backlights and a splash shield of a car and a large brown stain resembling blood. A piece of a broken scythe was also found at the scene of the incident.', '100.  Reports on the examination of the corpses of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev on 6 August 2000 attested the presence of a number of bleeding wounds of irregular shape, going from top downwards.', '101.  Reports on the medical forensic examination of the corpses of Khalid Khatsiyev and Kazbek Akiyev on 3 September 2001, based on the aforementioned two reports of 6 August 2000, confirmed that the corpses had borne bullet wounds, that the death of the two men had been caused by those wounds and that the location of the wounds indicated that they could have been inflicted in the circumstances described in the materials of the criminal case file.', '102.  An expert commission made up of two military experts, Mr M. (see paragraph 98 above) and Mr K., stated as follows in a report of 20 March 2002:\\n“According to the rules in force in the territory of the Chechen Republic and neighbouring regions, a driver of any transport vehicle is obliged, at the sight of a military helicopter, to stop the vehicle, get out and mark himself. Therefore the crew had the right to destroy the vehicle, which was moving away from the area of an attack without marking itself with a prearranged signal (a white flag, a green signal flare).”\\nThe report thus concluded that the pilots had been justified in their actions.', '103.  The materials submitted by the Government reveal that the investigating authorities also sent a number of queries and requests to various State bodies in the context of the investigation. In particular, on 1 December 2000 the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 sent a request to the military prosecutor of the Kursk garrison to establish whether the pilots who had attacked the Niva car had coordinated their actions with their superiors, to establish the identity of those superiors, and to establish who had taken the decision to attack the Niva car. It is unclear whether this request has ever been complied with, as there are no corresponding documents among the materials submitted by the Government.', '104.  The Government also adduced copies of domestic court decisions taken in unrelated sets of civil proceedings. These included a first-instance judgment and appeal decision awarding compensation for property damage inflicted by servicemen in Ingushetia; a first-instance judgment and appeal decision awarding damages to the first applicant in Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia (nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, judgment of 24 February 2005) in connection with the death of his relatives in Chechnya; and a first-instance judgment and appeal decision refusing compensation for property damage inflicted by servicemen in Ingushetia.'], 'applicants': ['KHATSIYEVA', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '2', '38'], 'violated_articles': ['2'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['100', '124', '25', '28', '47', '64', '66', '69', '72', '73', '75', '76', '77', '79', '82', '85', '86', '87', '91', '92', '99'], '13': ['152', '153']}, 'silver_rationales': [18, 21, 40, 57, 59, 62, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 84, 85, 92, 93], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [18, 21, 40, 57, 59, 62, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 84, 85, 92, 93], 'explained_indices': [4, 5, 7, 6, 35, 51, 50, 47, 46, 45, 44, 81, 52, 41, 40, 39, 38, 80, 53, 76, 82, 56, 57, 58, 59, 75, 74, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 77, 83, 71, 34, 95, 94, 93, 8, 9, 10, 92, 13, 14, 15, 16, 89, 70, 20, 88, 22, 33, 32, 29, 28, 21, 26, 27, 87, 23, 86, 91, 90, 85, 84, 73, 72, 79, 78, 48, 97, 66, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 67, 31, 30, 37, 42, 43, 96, 49, 54, 55, 60, 61, 36, 3, 1, 0, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.0030473992, 0.0012072809, 0.0005103983, -0.0013203919, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868507, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.0015868582, -0.013829898, -0.027993813, -0.033893373, -0.042836662], 'number_of_sentences': 98, 'article_id': 4, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

His father was an Italian national, who was never married to the first applicant but who has never disputed his paternity of Marko. In 2003 Marko’s parents separated and the applicants moved to a separate residence in Cerveteri, Italy. The applicants allege that ever since Marko’s birth he has in practice been in the exclusive care of his mother, and his father’s participation in his upbringing has been minimal.', '8.  At the request of the first applicant, on 20 September 2004 the Rome Youth Court (Tribunale per i minorenni di Roma) granted custody of Marko to his mother because the ongoing conflict between the parents made joint custody unfeasible. However, the court held that the father had a right to have his son stay at his home on specified days of the week and also whenever the first applicant was travelling outside Rome for a length of time exceeding one week or outside Italy for any length of time. The decision came into force on the day it was adopted.', '9.  Marko’s father appealed against that decision, requesting that joint custody be granted or that he be granted sole custody and that the first applicant be forbidden to take the child abroad or to change her place of residence without the father’s prior approval. The Youth Section of the Rome Court of Appeal (Corte d’appello di Roma. Sezione per i minorenni) rejected his request in a decision of 1 March 2005, noting, inter alia, that the child was developing well and that it was impossible to ensure his development by granting sole custody to the father. Furthermore, it was noted that the father’s concern that the first applicant might move to Latvia and take their son with her was unfounded because a judge in a guardianship hearing (giudice tutelare, “the guardianship judge”) had previously refused to issue a passport to Marko and also because his mother had strictly adhered to the ruling of the first-instance court and had left the child in his father’s care when travelling to Latvia.', '10.  On 24 June 2005 the guardianship judge granted an authorisation to issue a passport to Marko. On 11 July 2005 Marko’s father appealed against that decision. On 14 November 2005 the Rome Youth Court rejected Marko’s father’s appeal, because there was no evidence that the first applicant was planning to leave Italy with the child.', '11.  On 3 February 2006 the Court (Tribunale) of Civitavecchia ruled that Marko’s father had to make child support payments. The decision noted, inter alia, that the father had previously avoided financially supporting his son. Marko’s father failed to make the ordered payments and on 8 April 2006 the first applicant lodged a complaint about this with the Italian police.', '12.  It appears that because of Marko’s father’s failure to financially support the applicants their only income was money which the first applicant’s mother was sending from Latvia. However, in December of 2005 the first applicant’s mother informed her that she was no longer able to provide financial support. According to the applicants it was for that reason that they had no other choice but to return to Latvia in April of 2006. The applicants indicate that they subsequently continued to return to Italy for brief periods of time. According to the Italian Government, they have never been back.', '13.  On 7 February 2006 Marko was granted Latvian citizenship, since it was established that his mother’s permanent residence at the time of his birth had been in Latvia. Subsequently, the first applicant registered Marko’s permanent residence in an apartment in Rīga belonging to her.', '14.  On an unspecified date Marko’s father requested the Rome Youth Court to grant him interim sole custody of Marko and to order his return to Italy.', '15.  On 5 June 2006 that court issued a decision in which it upheld the father’s request. The decision noted that the first applicant’s actions had been harmful to the child. The court further held that it did not have jurisdiction to order the child’s return to Italy but indicated that Marko had to reside with his father. The decision finally provided that a hearing would be held on 25 October 2006 and that Marko’s father had an obligation to inform the first applicant of the court’s decision before 20 September 2006.', '16.  The applicants submit that the first applicant was not informed of the hearing that had been scheduled, nor did she receive a summons to it. The applicants further submit that Marko’s father had never requested full custody, but instead had asked the court to re-establish his rights of contact with the child and to order his return to Italy. The first applicant alleges that she only learned about the adopted decision in March of 2007.', '17.  On 16 January 2007 (by what appears to be a clerical error the document is dated 16 January 2006) the Italian Ministry of Justice, in its capacity as the Central Authority under Article 6 of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the Hague Convention”), issued a request for Marko to be returned to Italy.', '18.  After receiving the request, the Latvian Ministry of Child and Family Matters (Bērnu un ģimenes lietu ministrija), which is the Latvian Central Authority within the meaning of the Hague Convention, initiated civil proceedings against the first applicant in accordance with Article 7 of the Hague Convention. The Rīga City Vidzeme District Court, which had been allocated the case, requested the Rīga City Orphans’ Court (Rīgas bāriņtiesa) to evaluate the applicants’ residence and to issue an opinion concerning the possibility of returning Marko to his father in Italy. After visiting the applicants’ residence, by a decision of 20 March 2007 the Orphans’ Court established that the child’s living conditions were beneficial for his growth and development. It further noted that Marko had adjusted to living in his mother’s residence and that she was ensuring his full physical and intellectual development. Accordingly, the Orphans’ Court concluded that the child’s return to Italy would not be compatible with his best interests.', '19.  That conclusion was also supported by the findings of a psychologist, whose opinion had been requested by the applicants’ lawyer. In a report dated 30 March 2007 the psychologist concluded that severance of contact between Marko and his mother was not to be allowed, in that it could negatively affect the child’s development and could even create neurotic problems and illnesses.', '20.  By a letter of 6 April 2007, the Italian Central Authority attested to the Latvian Central Authority that if any of the circumstances mentioned in Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention arose Italy would be able to activate a wide-ranging child protection network which could ensure that Marko and his father received psychological help.', '21.  On 11 April 2007 the Rīga City Vidzeme District Court issued a decision by which it refused the father’s request to return Marko to Italy. That court based its decision on the Hague Convention and Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility (“the Regulation”). The court held that the removal of Marko had been wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention and the Regulation, since it had been carried out without his father’s permission. It was further noted that it was not expedient to hear Marko’s own opinion, since he was four years old at the time and was unable to form an opinion about which of his parents he should live with.', '22.  The court considered it necessary to assess whether the circumstances provided for in Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention existed. Its conclusion was that those circumstances existed. It noted the ties between Marko and his mother and the fact that he had settled well in Latvia and considered that his continued residence in Latvia was essential for his development. The Vidzeme District Court found that the provisions of Article 11 (4) of the Regulation had not been fulfilled, because it was financially impossible for the first applicant to follow Marko to Italy if he were returned there. Furthermore, the guarantees provided for by Italy could not ensure that the child would not suffer psychologically and that his mental health would not be prejudiced. Accordingly the court applied Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention and refused the father’s request.', '23.  On 24 May 2007 the Rīga Regional Court adopted a final decision, by which it rejected the father’s appeal against the decision of the Vidzeme District Court. In substance the Regional Court agreed with the conclusions of the first-instance court, adding that the guarantees offered by the Italian Central Authority concerning the protection available to Marko after his potential return to Italy were too vague and non-specific. It was also mentioned that Marko’s father had made no effort to establish contact with his son ever since the applicants’ departure from Italy.', '24.  On 4 June 2007 the first applicant requested the Rīga City Vidzeme District Court to grant her sole custody of Marko. On 8 January 2008 the Rīga Custody Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that granting sole custody of Marko to his mother was in his best interests. The Custody Court indicated among other considerations the fact that Marko’s father had not seen his son since 2006.', '25.  On 7 August 2007 Marko’s father lodged a request with the Rome Youth Court, which was based on Article 11 (4), (7) and (8) of the Regulation, to issue an immediately executable decision ordering Marko’s return to Italy.', '26.  On 11 December 2007 the first applicant submitted her observations to that court, in which she acknowledged that she had left Italy because of an ongoing conflict with Marko’s father and because of her difficult financial situation. She noted that Marko’s father had never travelled to see his son in Latvia; however, she stated that the applicants were always available to come to Italy to meet Marko’s father during school holidays. In conclusion, she requested that the court order child support payments in the amount of 700 euros (EUR) per month.', '27.  In the context of separate proceedings, on 11 January 2008 the Civitavecchia Court made a judgment concerning the first applicant’s request for child support payments and ordered Marko’s father to pay the first applicant EUR 4,800 plus interest, starting from 14 October 2004.', '28.  By a decision of 21 April 2008 the Rome Youth Court upheld the father’s request. It considered that the only role left to it by Article 11 (4) of the Regulation was to verify whether adequate arrangements had been made to secure the protection of the child from any identified risks within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention after his or her return. After considering the first applicant’s submissions, the court noted that the father had proposed that Marko would stay with him, while the first applicant would be authorised to use a house in Aranova for periods of fifteen to thirty consecutive days during the first year and subsequently for one summer month every other year (the first applicant would have to cover her own travel expenses and one half of the rent of the house in Aranova), during which time Marko would be staying with his mother, while the father would retain the right to visit him on a daily basis. Marko would be enrolled in a kindergarten which he had attended before his removal from Italy. He would also attend a swimming pool he had used before his departure from Italy. The father furthermore undertook to ensure that the child would receive adequate psychological help and would attend Russian-language classes for Russian children. The court considered such an arrangement adequate to fulfil the requirements of the Regulation and ordered an immediate execution of its decision to return Marko to Italy and to have him reside with his father. The court also pointed out that it would be preferable if the first applicant accompanied Marko on his way to Italy but, should that prove to be impossible, his return would be arranged by the Italian embassy in Latvia. Due to the urgent nature of the case, the decision was pronounced to be immediately executable.', '29.  On 18 June 2008 (in what appears to be a clerical error, the date indicated in the document is 18 June 2009) the first applicant lodged a request with the Youth Court to suspend the execution of its decision. She argued that Marko had not been heard by the tribunal and that the Youth Court had not taken into consideration the arguments which the Latvian courts had used in their decisions when applying Article 13 of the Hague Convention.', '30.  On 20 June 2008 the first applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the Rome Youth Court of 21 April 2008. In her appeal she requested that the execution of that decision be suspended; that the appeal court hear Marko; that there be an order that she retain sole custody of Marko; and that Marko’s father be ordered to pay EUR 700 per month in child support payments.', '31.  On 22 July 2008 the Rome Youth Court adopted a decision in which it rejected the first applicant’s request to suspend the execution of the decision of 21 April. That court considered that it was not appropriate to question the child, taking into account his young age and the level of maturity. Furthermore, it considered that Article 42 of the Regulation did not oblige it to hear the parties in person. It remarked that all of the decisions taken by the Latvian courts had been duly taken into consideration. Finally, the court upheld the father’s request to issue a return certificate in accordance with Articles 40, 42 and 47 of the Regulation. The certificate was issued on 29 July 2008.', '32.  On 14 August 2008 the Italian Central Authority sent a letter to the Latvian Central Authority, forwarding the Youth Court’s decision of 22 July 2008 and inviting it to advise the Italian side on “the initiatives that will be taken in order to enforce the return order made by the Youth Court in Rome”.', '33.  On 27 August 2008 a psychologist issued another report on Marko’s psychological state. The report concluded that the child had developed certain psychological problems in connection with his father’s request to return him to Italy. It further reiterated the conclusion from the earlier report, that Marko had strong emotional ties with his mother, the severance of which was impermissible.', '34.  On 10 September 2008 the first applicant received information from the Latvian Central Authority about the request made by the Italian Central Authority. The first applicant was informed that Latvia had an obligation to enforce the 21 April 2008 decision of the Rome Youth Court.', '35.  On 13 February 2009 the first applicant submitted a request to the Rīga City Vidzeme District Court, requesting it to indicate interim measures and not to allow Marko’s return to Italy “until he himself agrees to return to his father in Italy”. Further, she requested the court to require the Rome Court of Appeal and the Rome Youth Court to surrender their competence to the Vidzeme District Court, since that court had already, on 4 June 2007, been allocated a still pending case concerning the granting of sole custody of Marko to his mother, and also because the child’s permanent residence was in Latvia.', '36.  On 18 February 2009 the Vidzeme District Court adopted a decision in which it decided not to proceed with the first applicant’s request concerning the question of Marko’s custody, since it considered that the first applicant’s appeal against the Rome Youth Court’s decision of 21 April 2008, which was pending at the time before the Rome Court of Appeal, concerned the same subject matter, with the same parties involved.', '37.  On 21 April 2009 the Rome Court of Appeal adopted a decision concerning the first applicant’s appeal against the Rome Youth Court’s decision of 21 April 2008. The appeal court first of all observed that pursuant to Article 11 (8) of the Regulation (see below, paragraph 45) it had jurisdiction to decide the question of the child’s return to Italy. It then went on to observe that the first-instance court had correctly implemented the procedure set out in Article 11 (7) of the Regulation (see below, paragraph 45), as attested by the reasoned opinion of the European Commission (see below, paragraphs 39-45). The court continued by observing that the decision to grant Marko’s father sole custody had been motivated by the first applicant’s behaviour when she had chosen to take the child to Latvia and by the father’s undertaking to take care of the child in Italy. The Court of Appeal therefore upheld the decision of the Rome Youth Court and ordered that after the child’s return to Italy he be enrolled in a primary school.', '38.  On 10 July 2009 the bailiff of the Rīga Regional Court charged with the execution of the Rome Youth Court decision of 21 April 2008 invited Marko’s father to provide assistance in the execution of that decision by re‑establishing contact with his son. It appears that Marko’s father has not responded to that request in any way.', '39.  On 15 October 2008 the Republic of Latvia brought an action against Italy before the European Commission in application of Article 227 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. Latvia alleged, in particular, that the above-described proceedings in Italy (the decision adopted on 21 April 2008 and the issuing of the return certificate in July 2008) did not conform to the Regulation, in that neither of the applicants had been heard by the Rome Youth Court on 21 April 2008, and also that the Rome Youth Court had ignored the decisions of 11 April 2007 of the Rīga City Vidzeme District Court and of 24 May 2007 of the Rīga Regional Court.', '40.  On 15 January 2009 the Commission issued a reasoned opinion. It held that Italy had violated neither the Regulation nor the “general principles of the Community law”. In so far as is relevant to the case before the Court, the Commission held as follows.', '41.  At the outset it reiterated that, given the particular circumstances of the case, where Latvia was disputing the legality of the actions of an Italian authority with a judicial function, the scope of the Commission’s review was very limited. The Commission could only review matters of procedure, not substance, and it had to respect the decisions made by the Italian courts in the exercise of their discretionary powers.', '42.  Concerning the argument of the Republic of Latvia that the decision of 21 April 2008 had been adopted without attempting to obtain Marko’s opinion, the Commission stressed that it followed from the Regulation, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (“the UN Convention”), the Hague Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that hearing a child’s opinion with regard to questions concerning that child was a fundamental principle. However, that principle was not absolute. What had to be taken into account was the level of the child’s development. That level was not and could not be defined in any international instruments, therefore the national authorities retained wide discretion in such questions. The Commission held that the Italian Central Authority had used that discretion and indicated in the certificate of return that it had not been necessary for the Italian courts to hear Marko. Therefore, none of the international instruments that had been invoked by Latvia had been breached.', '43.  Latvia further criticised the fact that the decision of 21 April 2008 had been adopted without duly taking into account the position of the first applicant, and that the decision had been adopted without hearing either of the parties, including the first applicant, who was neither informed of the time of the forthcoming hearing nor invited to take part in it. The Commission noted that the decision of 21 April 2008 had been adopted in written proceedings, without hearing oral submissions of either of the parties, which was fully in conformity with the applicable Italian procedural legislation. The Commission interpreted Article 42 (2) (b) of the Regulation (see below, paragraph 51) in the light of the Court’s case-law (referring in particular to Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, § 32, Series A no. 274), and considered that the use of written proceedings was permissible as long as the principle of equality of arms was observed. The Commission observed that the first applicant had been given an opportunity to submit written observations on equal grounds with Marko’s father and thus neither the Regulation nor the UN Convention had been violated.', '44.  Lastly, Latvia criticised the decision of 21 April 2008 and the related return certificate for ignoring the Latvian authorities’ reasons for refusing to order Marko’s return to Italy. The Commission indicated that its role was not to analyse the substance of the Italian authorities’ decisions – it was limited to appraising the compliance with the procedure which led to the adoption of those decisions with the procedural requirements of the Regulation. Nothing in the Regulation forbade the Italian authorities to come to a conclusion that was opposite to the one reached by the Latvian authorities. Quite to the contrary, the Commission considered that the Regulation gave the country of the child’s residence prior to the abduction “the final say” in ordering the return, even if his or her new country of residence had declined to order the return. In this regard the Commission noted that the Rīga Regional Court, when adopting the decision of 24 May 2007 (see above, paragraph 23), had referred to the Law of Civil Procedure, section 64419 (6) (2) of which permits refusal to return a child if the child is well settled in Latvia and his or her return is not in his or her interests. The Commission questioned the Latvian court’s alleged failure to invoke the “much more binding” Article 13 of the Hague Convention, which in their opinion demonstrated that the Latvian courts had devoted attention to Marko’s situation in Latvia instead of the potential consequences of his return to Italy. In short, the Commission had “not discovered any indications” that life in Italy together with his father would expose Marko to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. What is more, the Commission considered that the Rome Youth Court in its decision of 21 April 2008 had directly addressed the Rīga Regional Court’s concerns that the measures envisaged for Marko’s protection upon his return to Italy were too vague – the Italian court had set out specific obligations on the father which would allow for balanced development of the child and for him to have contact with both parents.', '45.  In conclusion the Commission conceded that the decision of 21 April 2008 did not contain a detailed analysis of either the arguments of the first applicant or of those of Marko’s father. However, it considered that the Regulation did not require such an analysis. Therefore, the exact procedure to be followed in that respect was left to the national courts’ discretion. Taking that into account, it was found that neither Latvia nor the Commission could dispute the particular formulation of the Italian court’s decision.', '46.   The Hague Convention, which has been ratified by Latvia and Italy, provides, in so far as relevant, as follows.\\nArticle 3\\n“The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where –\\na) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and\\nb) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\\nThe rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.”\\nArticle 4\\n“The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights. The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.”\\nArticle 6\\n“A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Convention upon such authorities. [..]”\\nArticle 7\\n“Central Authorities shall co-operate with each other and promote co-operation amongst the competent authorities in their respective State to secure the prompt return of children and to achieve the other objects of this Convention.\\nIn particular, either directly or through any intermediary, they shall take all appropriate measures –\\n[..]\\nf) to initiate or facilitate the institution of judicial or administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining the return of the child and, in a proper case, to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access; [..]”\\nArticle 11\\n“The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.\\nIf the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay. If a reply is received by the Central Authority of the requested State, that Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be.”\\nArticle 12\\n“Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.\\nThe judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.\\nWhere the judicial or administrative authority in the requested State has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child.”\\nArticle 13\\n“Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that –\\na) the person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention; or\\nb) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\\nThe judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.\\nIn considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by the Central Authority or other competent authority of the child’s habitual residence.”\\nArticle 20\\n“The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”', '47.  Paragraph 17 of the preamble of the Regulation explains its scope, in so far as it is relevant to this case, as follows:\\n“In cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child, the return of the child should be obtained without delay, and to this end the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 would continue to apply as complemented by the provisions of this Regulation, in particular Article 11. The courts of the Member State to or in which the child has been wrongfully removed or retained should be able to oppose his or her return in specific, duly justified cases. However, such a decision could be replaced by a subsequent decision by the court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child prior to the wrongful removal or retention. Should that judgment entail the return of the child, the return should take place without any special procedure being required for recognition and enforcement of that judgment in the Member State to or in which the child has been removed or retained.”', '48.  With regard to jurisdiction in cases of child abduction, the Regulation, in Article 10, provides, in so far as is relevant, as follows:\\n“In case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention shall retain their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another Member State and:\\n...\\n(b) the child has resided in that other Member State for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child and the child is settled in his or her new environment and at least one of the following conditions is met:\\n(i) within one year after the holder of rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return has been lodged before the competent authorities of the Member State where the child has been removed or is being retained;\\n...\\n(iv) a judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child has been issued by the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention.”', '49.  Article 11, which is specifically singled out in the preamble, provides as follows:\\n“1. Where a person, institution or other body having rights of custody applies to the competent authorities in a Member State to deliver a judgment on the basis of the Hague Convention [..], in order to obtain the return of a child that has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, paragraphs 2 to 8 shall apply. 2. When applying Articles 12 and 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, it shall be ensured that the child is given the opportunity to be heard during the proceedings unless this appears inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity. 3. A court to which an application for return of a child is made as mentioned in paragraph 1 shall act expeditiously in proceedings on the application, using the most expeditious procedures available in national law.\\nWithout prejudice to the first subparagraph, the court shall, except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible, issue its judgment no later than six weeks after the application is lodged. 4. A court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13 (b) of the [..] Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return. 5. A court cannot refuse to return a child unless the person who requested the return of the child has been given an opportunity to be heard.\\n[..] 7.  Unless the courts in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention have already been seized by one of the parties, the court or central authority that receives [a copy of an order on non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the Hague Convention and of the documents relevant to that order] must notify it to the parties and invite them to make submissions to the court, in accordance with national law, within three months of the date of notification so that the court can examine the question of custody of the child. [..] 8. Notwithstanding a judgment of non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the [..] Hague Convention, any subsequent judgment which requires the return of the child issued by a court having jurisdiction under this Regulation shall be enforceable in accordance with Section 4 of Chapter III below in order to secure the return of the child.”', '50.  Pursuant to Article 40 (1) (b) of the Regulation, its Section 4 applies to “the return of a child entailed by a judgment given pursuant to Article 11 (8)”', '51.  Article 42 in Section 4 provides the following:\\n“1. The return of a child referred to in Article 40 (1) (b) entailed by an enforceable judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with paragraph 2.\\nEven if national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law, notwithstanding any appeal, of a judgment requiring the return of the child mentioned in Article 11 (b) (8), the court of origin may declare the judgment enforceable. 2. The judge of origin who delivered the judgment referred to in Article 40 (1) (b) shall issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 only if:\\n(a) the child was given an opportunity to be heard, unless a hearing was considered inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity;\\n(b) the parties were given an opportunity to be heard; and\\n(c) the court has taken into account in issuing its judgment the reasons for and evidence underlying the order issued pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention. [..]”', '52.  As concerns the enforcement of judgments requiring the return of a child, Article 47 of the Regulation provides the following:\\n“1.

The applicants were born in 1954, 1955, 1986 and 1990, respectively, and live in Budapest.', '5.  The applicants are husband and wife and their son and daughter. In December 1987 the parents travelled to Cuba on a trip organised by a travel agency. On 13 December 1987 the tourist group had dinner at a restaurant where they were served poisonous sea food. As a consequence, the muscles and the nervous systems of the first and the second applicant were seriously damaged which caused 67% disability.', '6.  In 1988 the first applicant brought an action against the travel agency in the Budapest II/III District Court claiming damages. The case was then transferred to the competent Pest Central District Court.', '7.  In an interim judgment (közbenső ítélet), on 23 March 1990 the District Court established the travel agency’s responsibility. After a hearing on 11 June 1993, in a partial judgment (részítélet) of 15 June 1993, it ordered the defendant to pay 600,000 Hungarian forints plus interest to the first applicant, but dismissed his claims for non-pecuniary damage.', '8.  In the continued proceedings, the District Court held hearings on 16 February, 11 May, 23 September and 9 December 1994, 7 July and 6 October 1995, 17 May 1996, and 9 May and 16 July 1997. The Government stated that further hearings took place on 16 January and 17 April 1998.', '9.  On 24 April 1998 the court delivered a decision ordering the defendant to pay damages and an allowance to the first applicant.', '10.  On appeal, on 10 December 1998 the Budapest Regional Court confirmed the first-instance decision. The applicant filed a petition for review on 27 January 1999.', '11.  On 30 March 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the petition. This decision was served on 18 June 2001.', '12.  Meanwhile, on 14 January 1998 all four applicants brought an action in the Pest Central District Court against the travel agency claiming further damages. Subsequently, the case was transferred to the Budapest II/III District Court.

The Budapest II/III District Court held hearings on 27 May 1999 and 19 May 2000. On 27 June 2000 it decided to transfer the case to the Buda Central District Court.

The applicant was born in 1959 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Jelgava Prison.', '5.  On 4 October 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.', '6.  On 13 September 2002 the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa) convicted the applicant of aggravated murder, burglary and theft and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment.', '7.  On 3 February 2003 the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Krimināllietu tiesu palāta) upheld the conviction for burglary and theft, acquitted the applicant of the charge of aggravated murder, and convicted him of murder instead. The sentence was reduced to twelve years’ imprisonment.', '8.  On 17 March 2003 the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Senāts) dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant in a preparatory meeting.', '9.  The applicant has since been serving his sentence in various prisons: Central Prison, Brasa Prison, Matīsa Prison, Jelgava Prison, Daugavpils Prison and Daugavgrīva Prison.', '10.  On 18 October 2007 the applicant was convicted of attacking a member of prison staff in Daugavpils Prison. He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.', '11.  On 1 July 2009, at around 10 a.m., the applicant was searched, as he was scheduled to be transferred to Jelgava Prison. The applicant had more than 30 kg of personal effects, which was the maximum, so he was asked to leave some things behind. A dispute ensued between the applicant and prison officers M.B., A.F. and K.D., who had carried out the search.', '12.  According to the Government, the applicant tried to obstruct the search, insulted the prison officers, used contemptuous and abusive language, and made threats. In particular, he said he was “a former boxer” and that he could “kill anyone” since he had “nothing left to lose”. The prison officers tried to calm the applicant down and verbally ordered him to stop behaving aggressively. The applicant ignored those requests and, instead, at around 10.20 a.m., grabbed M.B. by the arm and tried to hit him. M.B. avoided the blow. Prison officers A.F. and K.D. used restraint measures (blows with rubber truncheons) to stop the applicant’s aggressive behaviour, for about three minutes.', '13.  The applicant did not contest the Government’s version of events, but said that he was brutally beaten by three prison officers until he fell to the ground unconscious. He received more blows when he regained consciousness.', '14.  At around 10.50 a.m. the applicant was taken to the prison medical unit. A doctor wrote a note indicating that the applicant had “many bruises on [his] body, arms and legs”. The following remarks were made in the applicant’s medical record: “A dark violet, elongated haematoma 20 x 2 cm in the right shoulder blade area. A dark violet haematoma 25 x 17 cm in the left shoulder blade area. A haematoma 16 x 6 cm on the left (upper) arm. A haematoma 8 x 3 cm on the left forearm. A haematoma 20 x 3 cm on the right (upper) arm. A haematoma 10 x 2 cm on the right forearm. Small abrasions and haematomas on both legs.”', '15.  After the incident, on 1 July 2009, prison officers A.F. and K.D. filled in a report form on the use of restraint measures. It was mentioned that the applicant had issued threats against the prison guards, had attempted to hit M.B., and that A.F. and K.D. had intervened to stop the attack. They had used restraint measures (blows with truncheons) for about three minutes, from 10.20 to 10.23 a.m. The doctor made an entry in the report, with the same remarks as he had made in the applicant’s medical record (see paragraph 14 above). In the field for the applicant’s comments, he requested that criminal proceedings be instituted in connection with this incident. He submitted that the conflict had been provoked by the prison officers and that he had been brutally beaten by them with truncheons on the head and body.', '16.  On 1 July 2009, at an unspecified time, the applicant was transferred to Central Prison.', '17.  On 2 July 2009 he underwent a medical examination in Central Prison. An X-ray was carried out, but no broken bones were detected.', '18.  On 3 July 2009 the applicant was transferred to Jelgava Prison to continue serving his sentence there.', '19.  On 2 July 2009 the applicant complained to a prosecutor about the incident that had taken place the day before. The complaint was forwarded to the Prisons Administration (Ieslodzījuma vietu pārvalde).', '20.  On 16 July 2009 the Prisons Administration forwarded the complaint to Daugavgrīva Prison for an internal inquiry (resoriskā pārbaude) together with instructions to conduct detailed questioning of prison officers about their actions in relation to the applicant, and to adduce these statements together with medical records and internal reports. A time-limit of 30 July 2009 was set for the inquiry to be carried out and for its results to be submitted to the Prisons Administration.', '21.  On 28 July 2009 prison officers K.D., M.B. and A.F. made statements in writing. These indicated that the applicant had been aggressive and had threatened them, had not complied with their order to calm down, and had attempted to attack M.B. At that point K.D. and A.F. had hit him with truncheons.', '22.  On 29 July 2009 a senior inspector (investigator) of Daugavgrīva Prison drew up an internal inquiry report (resoriskās pārbaudes slēdziens), which was approved by the governor of Daugavgrīva Prison. The senior inspector relied on the statements given by the prison officers and on the applicant’s medical record; he noted that no injuries to the applicant’s face had been recorded. The conclusion was drawn that the restraint measures (blows with truncheons) had been used in compliance with domestic law.', '23.  On 3 August 2009 a senior inspector of the Investigation Unit of the Prisons Administration refused to institute criminal proceedings. No reasons were given. The applicant was informed about the decision and, on 17 August 2009, he lodged an appeal against it.', '24.  On 7 September 2009 a prosecutor quashed that decision, instituted criminal proceedings, and tasked the Prisons Administration with conducting an investigation. On 9 September 2009 the applicant was informed of this, and the case material was sent to the Prisons Administration.', '25.  On 15 October 2009 another senior investigator of Daugavgrīva Prison took a statement from a member of prison staff about video surveillance in the prison; that member of staff stated that the room where the applicant had been searched did not come within the field of vision of the security cameras and, in any event, video recordings were kept for only four days.', '26.  On 16 October 2009 the investigator took statements from A.F. and M.B., but not from K.D.', '27.  A.F. stated that he had inflicted approximately four blows on the applicant’s back with the truncheon, he had not hit him on the head, and he did not know how many blows had been inflicted by K.D.', '28.  M.B. stated that his colleagues had inflicted some five to ten blows with truncheons to the applicant’s arms, legs and back.', '29.  On 16 and 19 October 2009 the senior investigator of Daugavgrīva Prison took statements from two more prison officers, who were eyewitnesses to the events of 1 July 2009. They both stated that the applicant had attempted to attack M.B.', '30.  On 1 November 2010 the applicant submitted a handwritten statement to the prosecutor with a view to having it added to the case material; it was forwarded to the Prisons Administration. According to the applicant, A.F. had delivered blows to his lower jaw and the left side of his chest. Blows to his arms had ensued as he was trying to cover his face. He had then received an order to face the wall; M.B., and an unknown officer had taken their truncheons and all three of them had started hitting him on the body in a cruel manner. He had fallen to the ground unconscious. After he regained consciousness, he sat up with his back against the wall. M.B. had come forward and started beating him on the legs.', '31.  On 17 November 2009 the applicant gave evidence to a senior investigator of Jelgava Prison. He did not deny that he had had a verbal altercation or that he had threatened M.B. with physical violence. The applicant stated that A.F. had beaten him with a truncheon in a cruel manner. He had received blows to his jaw, the left side of his chest, both arms and other parts of his body; he could not remember the number of blows. M.B. and a guard whose name he did not know had joined in and they had delivered numerous blows to his body with truncheons. He had eventually lost consciousness and fallen to the ground. After he had regained consciousness M.B. had continued beating him with a truncheon.', '32.  On 18 December 2009 the senior investigator of Daugavgrīva Prison, on the instructions of the senior investigator of Jelgava Prison, took a statement from the doctor of the medical unit, who had nothing to say as he did not remember the events. He stated that all matters related to the applicant’s state of health had been entered in his medical record.', '33.  On 18 January 2010 the senior investigator of Jelgava Prison took statements from two doctors of the medical unit about the applicant’s medical examination on admission to that prison. The following day the senior investigator ordered a forensic medical examination to determine the severity of the applicant’s injuries.', '34.  On 19 January 2010 an expert examined the applicant’s medical documentation and drew up report no. 10. On the basis of the applicant’s medical records the expert established that the applicant had the following injuries: injuries with two ecchymoses on his back in the area of shoulder blades, an injury with an ecchymosis on both the upper and lower left arm, an injury with an ecchymosis on the lower right arm, an injury with an ecchymosis (on the back) on the right thigh, an injury with an ecchymosis on the lower right leg and skin abrasions on both legs. These were classified as minor injuries. The expert considered that these injuries might have been inflicted on 1 July 2009 by a hard, blunt, truncheon-like object. Considering the nature and location of the bruises, the expert concluded that there had been not less than two blows on the back, and not less than one blow to each forearm, (upper) arm, right thigh and right leg and that the applicant could not have inflicted such injuries on himself.', '35.  On 28 January 2010 the senior investigator of Jelgava Prison adopted a decision whereby the applicant was declared a victim in connection with the criminal proceedings. He was interviewed and maintained his previous statements.', '36.  On 11 February 2010 another senior investigator of Daugavgrīva Prison, upon instructions from the Investigation Unit of the Prisons Administration, took a statement from an inmate who had been in that prison at the time of the incident. He had not seen but had heard restraint measures being used on the applicant. In his submission, prison officers had exceeded their authority, as they had not stopped beating the applicant even when he was [lying] on the ground and had asked them to stop.', '37.  On 11 March 2010, upon a complaint by the applicant, the Prisons Administration informed him that certain unspecified investigative measures were being taken by the senior investigator of Jelgava Prison.', '38.  On 15 June 2010, upon a complaint by the applicant, the Prisons Administration informed him that a procedural decision would be taken soon and that he would be informed of it as soon as it was adopted.', '39.  On 6 July 2010 the chief inspector of the Investigation Unit of the Prisons Administration adopted a decision to terminate the criminal proceedings. The decision contained references to the applicant’s testimony, the statements of the prison officers and the doctors, and the conclusions drawn in forensic report no. 10. The evidence given by the inmate was not taken into account, since he had not been an eyewitness and had been some fifteen metres away from the scene. The conclusion was that on 1 July 2009 the prison officers had not used excessive force on the applicant and that the restraint measures (blows with truncheons) had been applied following a procedure prescribed by law. Therefore, the prison officers had not exceeded their official powers. The criminal proceedings were terminated on the grounds of absence of a crime.', '40.  On 3 August 2010 a prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s complaint. She agreed with the chief inspector’s conclusions that the use of physical force and restraint measures on the applicant was justified and complied with domestic law and instructions, that it was proportionate in the circumstances, and that official powers had not been exceeded.', '41.  On 30 August 2010 another prosecutor dismissed allegations by the applicant relating to the opportunity to acquaint himself with the case material.', '42.  On 1 October 2010 a superior prosecutor concluded that the applicant had acquainted himself with the case material with the assistance of an interpreter.', '43.  On 19 October 2010 another superior prosecutor adopted a final decision in respect of the applicant’s complaints. He concluded that the decision to terminate criminal proceedings was justified, that the applicant had received a copy of it, and that he had acquainted himself with the case material with the assistance of an interpreter.', '44.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the “CPT”) has called upon the Latvian authorities on numerous occasions to take immediate steps to ensure that investigations of allegations of ill-treatment by staff in prisons are carried out by an independent and impartial body. The relevant parts of the CPT reports following its visits to Latvia read as follows:\\nThe CPT visit from 27 November to 7 December 2007 (CPT/Inf (2009) 35):\\n“97. The CPT noted that, following the 2004 visit, the former Security Departments had been split into two separate entities, a security division (which reports directly to the prison governor) and an investigation division (which is subordinated to the deputy governor responsible for internal security). ... [T]wo major deficiencies still persist, despite the specific recommendations made by the Committee after the two previous visits. ... Secondly, prison officers (now members of the establishments’ investigation division) still carried out criminal investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by staff, initially on their own, and, subsequently, under the supervision of the competent prosecutor. The CPT wishes to recall once again that any investigations carried out by prison officers against other members of staff of the same establishment may be compromised as not being independent and impartial.\\nThe Committee calls upon the Latvian authorities to take immediate steps in the entire prison system to ensure that: ...\\n- officers of investigation divisions no longer carry out criminal investigations into alleged instances of ill-treatment by staff. Such investigations should be conducted by a body which is independent of the establishment concerned, and preferably of the prison system as a whole.”\\nThe CPT visit from 3 to 8 December 2009 (CPT/Inf (2011) 22):\\n“8. One of the most effective means of preventing ill-treatment by prison officers lies in the diligent examination of complaints of ill-treatment and, when appropriate, the imposition of suitable penalties. In this regard, it is regrettable that the role of the prison investigation divisions has not changed, despite the specific recommendation repeatedly made by the Committee after previous visits; investigations into possible ill-treatment by prison staff are still conducted by officers (of the investigation division) of the same establishment.\\nThis is not acceptable; investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by prison staff should be carried out by a body which is independent of the establishment concerned, and preferably of the prison system as a whole. The CPT calls upon the Latvian authorities to take immediate steps to ensure that this requirement is met (if necessary, by amending the relevant legal provisions).”\\nThe CPT visit from 5 to 15 September 2011 (CPT/Inf (2013) 20):\\n“109. Further, it remained the case that prison officers (members of the establishments’ investigation division) still carried out criminal investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by staff, initially on their own, and, subsequently, under the supervision of the competent prosecutor. This is unacceptable; such investigations should be conducted by a body which is independent of the establishment concerned, and preferably of the prison system as a whole.\\nIn this connection, the delegation was informed by the Ministry of Justice officials that a working group had been set up in order to elaborate the necessary legislative amendments with a view to ensuring that investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by prison staff were carried out by the police.\\nThe Committee calls upon the Latvian authorities to take immediate steps throughout the prison system to ensure that officers of investigation divisions no longer carry out criminal investigations into alleged instances of ill-treatment by staff.”', '45.  The Latvian Government provided the following response to the CPT’s reports on visits to Latvia:\\nResponse as regards visits from 27 November to 7 December 2007(CPT/Inf (2009) 36):\\n“According to requirements of [sections] 28, 386 and 387 of the Criminal Procedure Law (effective from 1 October 2005) investigation institutions in prisons do exist and investigators are authorised as independent persons, who investigate crimes committed by prisoners as well as by prison [staff] ... Ministry will advance revision of this recommendation in working group created for elaboration of the Criminal Procedure Law in the beginning of 2009.”\\nResponse as regards visit from 3 to 8 December 2009 (CPT/Inf (2011) 23):\\n“8. ... In the central [apparatus] of the [Prisons Administration, the LPA] the investigation division exists with three posts, whereas 17 inspectors execute investigation in prisons. Thereby prisons inspectors execute pre-trial investigations in criminal proceedings on severe criminal offences performed by prisoners, freelance employees in a territory of [a prison], as well as LPA officials....”\\nResponse as regards visit from 5 to 15 September 2011 (CPT/Inf (2013) 21):\\n“Paragraphs 108-109\\nPursuant to the provisions of section 387(5) of the Criminal Procedure Law, officials authorised by the Latvian Prisons Administration shall investigate criminal offences committed by detainees or prisoners, or by prison staff in prisons. Prison investigators perform pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings regarding serious and especially serious criminal offences committed by detainees or prisoners, hired labour staff in the territory of the prison, as well as officials of the Latvian Prisons Administration. ...\\nIn turn, pursuant to the provisions of Section 394(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Law, an investigator or public prosecutor may assign the performance of separate procedural actions or tasks to another investigating institution or an official authorised to perform criminal proceedings and the assignment shall be given in writing, indicating the matters that shall be ascertained by performing the relevant investigation activity or other operation.\\nIt is prescribed by Section 22(1)(5) of the Prisons Administration Law that an official, in performing service tasks, has the right to perform pre-trial investigations in conformity with the competence specified in the Criminal Procedure Law.

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Mielec.', '6.  The applicant is married with a child. Prior to her application for an early-retirement pension she had been employed until 1996 and paid social security contributions to the State.', '7.  On 23 April 2001 the applicant filed an application with the Rzeszów Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) to be granted the right to an early-retirement pension for persons raising children who, due to the seriousness of their health condition, required constant care, the so‑called “EWK” pension.', '8.  Along with her application for a pension, the applicant submitted, among other documents concerning her son’s health condition, a medical certificate issued by a specialist centre for nephrology on 16 March 2001. The certificate stated that the child (born in 1989) was in need of his parent’s constant care.', '9.  On 17 May 2001 the Rzeszów Social Security Board (“the SSB”) issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an early‑retirement pension as of 1 April 2001 in the net amount of 527.64 Polish zlotys (PLN).', '10.  On 19 September 2002 the Rzeszów Social Security Board issued simultaneously two decisions in respect of the applicant. By virtue of one decision, the payment of the applicant’s pension was discontinued with immediate effect. By virtue of the other decision, the Board reopened the proceedings, revoked the initial decision granting a pension and eventually refused to grant the applicant the right to an early-retirement pension under the scheme provided for by the Cabinet’s Ordinance of 15 May 1989 on the right to early retirement of employees raising children who require permanent care (Rozporządzenie Rady Ministrów z dn. 15 maja 1989 w sprawie uprawnień do wcześniejszej emerytury pracowników opiekujących się dziećmi wymagającymi stałej opieki) (“the 1989 Ordinance”).', '11.  The applicant appealed against the respective decisions divesting her of the right to an early-retirement pension. She submitted that she should receive the benefit because her child required constant care, as confirmed by the medical certificate attached to the applicant’s original application for a pension. Moreover, the applicant alleged that the revocation of her retirement pension was contrary to the principle of vested rights.', '12.  On 10 October 2003 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) quashed the SSB’s decision and restored the applicant’s right to a EWK pension. The court relied on experts’ opinions who stressed that the applicant’s son suffered from acute glomerulonephritis and nocturnal enuresis.', '13.  The SSB appealed against the first-instance judgment.', '14.  On 4 March 2004 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the first-instance judgment and upheld the SSB’s decision of 19 September 2002.', '15.  On 7 October 2004 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal.', '16.  Following the social security proceedings the applicant was not ordered to return her early-retirement benefits paid by the Social Security Board, despite the revocation of her right to an early-retirement pension.', '17.  The Government submitted that prior to the grant of a EWK pension the applicant had not worked. Her last employment contract had been terminated in 1996. After the revocation of the EWK pension the applicant had not worked. The applicant’s husband worked, as did her son (from 2005).', '18.  In addition, the Government submitted information as regards the various types of social benefits available in Poland. However, they did not specify which of those benefits, if any, were available in the applicant’s situation.', '19.  Under the relevant laws currently in force, it appears that the applicant will qualify for a regular retirement pension in 2022.', '20.  Some 130 applications arising from a similar fact pattern have been brought to the Court. The majority of the applicants form the Association of Victims of the SSB (Stowarzyszenie Osób Poszkodowanych przez ZUS) (“the Association”), an organisation monitoring the practices of the Social Security Board in Poland, in particular in the Podkarpacki region.', '21.  Out of all applications lodged with the Court, about twenty-four applicants decided not to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal given in their case.', '22.  One hundred-and-four applicants lodged cassation appeals against the final judgments given in their cases. The Supreme Court entertained and dismissed on the merits fifteen appeals. In eighty-one applications the Supreme Court refused to entertain cassation appeals on the ground that they did not raise any important legal issues or require the Supreme Court to give a new interpretation to legal provisions which raised serious doubts or gave rise to ambiguity in the jurisprudence of the domestic courts.

The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Gniezno.', '5.  The applicant and her husband married in 1987. Their daughter was born in the same year. At the end of 1988 the husband left the applicant and their daughter.', '6.  On 1 February 1989 the applicant’s husband filed a petition for divorce with the Gniezno District Court. He also sought eviction of the applicant from their matrimonial home. In the course of the proceedings the claimant modified his claims on several occasions.', '7.  On 9 May 1990 the Gniezno District Court ordered the claimant to pay interim maintenance to the applicant. The amount of interim maintenance was increased in the course of the proceedings on several occasions.', '8.  On an unspecified later date the applicant requested that judge P.K. withdraw from sitting in the case. On 4 October 1990 the Gniezno District Court granted the applicant’s request.', '9.  On an unspecified date at the beginning of 1992 the applicant requested that judge M.S. withdraw from sitting in the case. At about the same time, five other judges of that court declared that they wanted to withdraw. On 19 February 1992 the Poznań Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request in respect of judge M.S. It acceded to the requests to withdraw in respect of four judges of the Gniezno District Court. The applicant appealed against that decision. On 17 April 1992 the Poznań Court of Appeal quashed the contested decision and remitted the case. On 14 September 1992 the Poznań Regional Court ordered that two other judges of the District Court, including judge M.S., withdraw from the divorce case. It also ordered that the case be transmitted to the Września District Court for examination. The Regional Court considered that the particular position of the claimant, who was a doctor in the small town of Gniezno, might raise subjective doubts on the part of the applicant as to the impartiality of the judges of the Gniezno District Court.', '10.  On 14 May 1993 the Września District Court exempted the applicant from the court fees.', '11.  In 1995 the applicant was declared to have the so-called “third degree of invalidity” and was granted an invalidity pension.', '12.  On 9 May 1996 a panel of three judges of the Września District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for judge M.J. to withdraw from the case. It found that the applicant’s claims of bias based on alleged delays in the examination of her application for an increase of interim maintenance and lack of supervision of the experts had no bearing on the judge’s impartiality. The panel of the District Court also considered that there had been no links between judge M.J. and the parties to the proceedings which could call into question the impartiality of that judge. The applicant’s appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Poznań Regional Court on 10 September 1996. The Regional Court endorsed the findings of the District Court.', '13.  On 8 July 1997 the Września District Court dismissed the applicant’s renewed request for judge M.J. to withdraw. It also imposed a fine of PLN 300 on the applicant for the submission of a groundless request. It appears that the applicant appealed against that decision. However, she has not produced a copy of the decision given on appeal.', '14.  On an unspecified date before 1 July 1998 the applicant submitted to the District Court a medical certificate and requested an adjournment of the hearing scheduled for 1 July 1998 due to her illness.', '15.  On 1 July 1998 the court held a hearing and heard the claimant and two witnesses. The hearing in the case was closed.', '16.  On 3 July 1998 the applicant requested the court to reopen the hearing, referring to her medical certificate and to the fact that she had not been heard by the court.', '17.  On 6 July 1998 the Września District Court gave judgment and granted a divorce. It found that both parties had been at fault in respect of the breakdown of their marriage. It ordered the claimant to pay the applicant PLN 800 per month in maintenance in respect of their daughter. The applicant appealed against that judgment.', '18.  On 5 February 1999 the Poznań Regional Court held a hearing and heard both parties. On 9 February 1999 it gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment of the Regional Court.', '19.  On 26 July 2001 the Supreme Court held a hearing. On 9 August 2001 it gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. It found, inter alia, that the District Court’s decision to proceed with the hearing on 1 July 1998 had been incorrect, but that in any event it had not prejudiced the applicant’s right to defend her interests effectively in the proceedings. The Supreme Court had regard to the fact that the applicant had been heard earlier by the District Court on two occasions. Moreover, both the claimant and the defendant had been heard in the appeal proceedings before the Regional Court. In respect of the two witnesses who had been heard on 1 July 1998, the Supreme Court found that their evidence had been immaterial for the determination of the divorce case.

The first applicant, Mr Eberhard, was born in 1968 and lives in Ponikva. The second applicant, M., is his daughter.', '5.  On 8 April 2001 the first applicant’s wife, M.E., together with the second applicant, then aged four, moved out of the flat in which they had been living with the first applicant. M.E. subsequently filed a petition for divorce.', '6.  On 4 May 2001 the first applicant and his wife, with whom the second applicant was living, signed an agreement on access arrangements.', '7.  On 12 June 2001 the first applicant filed a request with the Šentjur Social Welfare Centre (“the Šentjur Centre”) seeking formal determination of the access arrangements, claiming that since 12 May 2001 M.E. had denied him access to the second applicant.', '8.  During the following month M.E. gave a number of statements at the Šentjur Centre, opposing contact between the applicants, stating that the first applicant represented a danger to her and the second applicant. She also lodged a criminal complaint against the first applicant for endangering their safety.', '9.  On 11 July 2001 the expert committee of the Šentjur Centre submitted an opinion in the case.', '10.  On 31 July 2001 a hearing was held at the Šentjur Centre. While the first applicant attended the hearing, M.E. refused to attend, claiming that she did not feel safe in the presence of the first applicant.', '11.  On 1 August 2001 the Šentjur Centre issued an order granting the first applicant four hours a week with the second applicant, taking into account the expert committee’s opinion and the fact that, at the supervised meeting between the applicants, the second applicant had not appeared to be afraid of the first applicant but, on the contrary, pleased to see him. The Šentjur Centre did not follow the first applicant’s proposal that he should be allowed to pick the second applicant up at her nursery; instead it ordered M.E. to bring the second applicant to a meeting point at a local train station.', '12.  On 3 October 2002, further to an appeal by M.E., the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs (“the Ministry”) modified the order in part. However, in essence, the access arrangements remained unaffected. The access order therefore became final and enforceable on 16 October 2002.', '13.  M.E. failed to comply with the order. She did not bring the second applicant to the meeting-point specified therein.', '14.  On 22 November 2002 the first applicant requested enforcement of the order. After hearing evidence from both parties, on 31 January 2003 the Šentjur Administrative Unit (“the Unit”) allowed the enforcement and ordered M.E. to hand the second applicant over to the first applicant at the next meeting. In addition, the Unit decided that if M.E. failed to do so she would be ordered to pay a fine of 5,000 Slovenian tolars (SIT) (approximately 25 euros (EUR)). It also noted that the fine could be increased in the event of further failure to comply.', '15.  M.E. continued to refuse the first applicant all access to the second applicant.', '16.  Further to the first applicant’s thirteen notices of non-compliance by M.E., on 3, 18, 23 and 30 April, 13 May and 9 June 2003 the Unit issued orders imposing fines which increased from SIT 5,000 to SIT 35,000 (approximately EUR 145). The orders were forwarded to the tax authorities for execution.', '17.  M.E. appealed against the orders.', '18.  According to letters addressed to the court by the Šentjur Centre on 8 September 2003 and 3 May 2004, in the context of proceedings no. P 667/2003, the Šentjur Centre and the Unit attempted to organise supervised meetings between the applicants, but M.E. refused to cooperate.', '19.  On 15 June 2004 the Ministry quashed the impugned enforcement orders, finding that M.E. had not been informed of the first applicant’s notices concerning non-compliance and had had no opportunity of participating in the proceedings and presenting arguments in her favour. The Ministry also found that the Unit had not examined the situation by verifying whether the meetings had actually failed to take place, and, if so, whether there had been justifiable reasons for such failure. The Ministry, however, noted that the order determining access arrangements remained enforceable and could not be challenged in those proceedings. The Unit was ordered to re‑examine the notices. Neither of the parties challenged the decision before the Administrative Court and it therefore became final on 29 June 2004.', '20.  Further to changes in legislation which stipulated that the first-instance authority should be in charge of enforcement, the Unit transferred the file to the Šentjur Centre on 7 April 2005. There are no indications in the case file that any steps were subsequently taken by the Šentjur Centre in the context of these proceedings.', '21.  On 14 June 2001, further to the divorce petition filed by M.E., the Celje District Court issued an interim decision granting M.E. provisional custody (varstvo in vzgoja) of the second applicant pending the outcome of the proceedings. This decision was upheld by the Celje Higher Court on 15 November 2001.', '22.  On 11 February 2002 the Celje District Court issued a judgment granting the first applicant and M.E. a divorce, granting M.E. custody of the second applicant and fixing the amount the first applicant had to pay in child support.', '23.  On 4 December 2002 the Celje Higher Court upheld M.E.’s appeal in part and increased the child support. This was a final decision in these proceedings.', '24.  On 6 June 2003 the first applicant lodged an application for custody of the second applicant, relying on the fact that M.E. was denying them contact. He also requested an interim order under which the second applicant would be placed in his custody pending the outcome of the proceedings, and the appointment of a curator ad litem to represent the second applicant’s interests in the proceedings. He further requested that the case be granted priority. On 7 July 2003 the applicant submitted documents in support of his request for exemption from obligation to pay the court fees.', '25.  The hearing scheduled for 30 September 2003 was cancelled at the first applicant’s request.', '26.  At a hearing held on 20 November 2003 the first applicant requested to have the case dealt with through mediation. The request was allowed by the court. However, it would appear that M.E. showed no interest in resolving the issues in that manner.', '27.  On 3 March 2004 the first applicant requested the President of the court to establish why no hearing had been scheduled. The next day a hearing was scheduled for 1 April 2004. That hearing was then adjourned as M.E. did not attend. The Šentjur Centre was requested to conduct an interview with M.E. and to inform the court about the implementation of contact between the applicants.', '28.  At the hearing of 13 May 2004, the first applicant requested that the proceedings be stayed, after having had an opportunity to see the second applicant at the school’s parent-teacher meetings.', '29.  However, as M.E. continued to refuse any contact between the applicants, on 16 August 2004 the first applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed and a hearing was scheduled for 7 October 2004. It was adjourned as the court decided, further to the first applicant’s request, to appoint an expert psychologist. On 19 October 2004 the court appointed expert D.T. to produce an opinion in the case.', '30.  On 24 May 2005 the first applicant lodged written submissions and requested the court to urge the expert to prepare the opinion. In addition, he made an alternative request seeking, inter alia, a change in the access arrangements and to have proceedings Pn 22/2005 (see paragraphs 52-62 below) joined to the current set of proceedings. In these and subsequent submissions the second applicant was also mentioned as a plaintiff.', '31.  On 16 June 2005 and 7 December 2005 the first applicant lodged further written submissions. In the first set, he submitted that he had had no access to the second applicant. He also asked the court to appoint another expert, as D.T. had failed to produce an opinion. In the second set of submissions the first applicant urged the court to issue the interim custody order (see paragraph 24 above) and added an alternative request for an interim access order. In the latter, he emphasised the need to organise the visits in a manner that would prevent M.E. from obstructing them. Accordingly, he proposed to pick the second applicant up from school, after her lessons. The first applicant also informed the court that, to his knowledge, M.E. was refusing to be examined by D.T., and complained about the passivity of the court. In addition, the first applicant alerted the court to the fact that he had had no access to the second applicant in the past four and a half years, except on one occasion at her school.', '32.  In the meantime, the appointed expert informed the court on 22 September 2005 that he was unable to prepare the opinion as M.E. had refused to cooperate. On 8 December 2005, the court informed the first applicant that it would decide on the interim orders only when the expert opinion was available.', '33.  On 22 February 2006 the first applicant lodged supervisory appeals with the President of the court and the Ministry of Justice complaining about the passivity of the judge.', '34.  On 23 February 2006 the first applicant again urged the court to decide on the case, stressing that M.E. was deliberately avoiding examination by the expert.', '35.  On 27 February 2006 the judge prepared a report in reply to supervisory appeal. The next day the President of the court replied to the first applicant. He noted that no interference with the judge’s decision concerning the appointment of the expert was permitted and that there were no reasons for any measures to be taken in response to the first applicant’s supervisory appeal. He also informed him that the main reason for the delay in the proceedings was M.E.’s failure to cooperate and reassured him that if the expert could still not examine M.E. the court would decide on the interim access order in the absence of an expert opinion.', '36.  On 14 March 2006 the first applicant requested the expert, the judge and the President of the court to step down from the case, arguing that they were inactive. His requests were dismissed on the ground that the statutory conditions for withdrawal were not fulfilled.', '37.  On 20 March 2006 M.E. was examined by the expert.', '38.  On 19 May 2006 the court held a hearing concerning the interim orders. Beforehand, it acquired information concerning the first applicant’s criminal record and relevant information from the Šentjur Centre and M.E.’s bank. All parties were present at the hearing. Subsequently, on 26 May 2006, the court issued a decision rejecting the first applicant’s application for provisional custody and upholding his alternative request for an interim access order. It noted that “during the court proceedings the applicants had contact once in 2004 at the school in Celje and, subsequently, twice at the school in Ljubljana”. The applicants were granted the right to spend, inter alia, one afternoon a week together, whereby the first applicant would pick the second applicant up after school and return her to M.E. at 5 p.m., plus every second weekend and part of the holidays. These arrangements were to be implemented after three weekly preparatory meetings. The court also decided that M.E. could be subjected to a fine of SIT 500,000 (approximately EUR 2,080) if she was found to be preventing or obstructing contact between the applicants. The second applicant was by then nine years old.', '39.  As M.E. and the second applicant moved to Ljubljana, the Ljubljana Vič-Rudnik Social Welfare Centre (“the Ljubljana Centre”) obtained jurisdiction in the case. On 13, 20 and 27 June 2006 the applicants had contact in the context of the preparatory meetings held at the Ljubljana Centre. The Centre assessed the visits very positively. In answer to the court’s request, the Ljubljana Centre informed it that subsequent contact between the applicants did not appear to have been hindered.', '40.  On 21 August 2006 the first applicant lodged written submissions complaining that on certain occasions he had been denied access to the second applicant. He also requested that M.E. be penalised as stipulated in the decision of 26 May 2006.', '41.  On 24 October 2006 the expert D.T. issued a report which assessed the relationship between the applicants in positive terms, finding that the second applicant showed affection for the first applicant and that there were no reasons to doubt the latter’s capacity to be a parent. D.T. further found that M.E. had in the past year changed her attitude regarding the relationship between the applicants and gained some trust in the first applicant. D.T. also noted that the second applicant was growing up with her mother and had expressed a wish to continue living with her.', '42.  On 2 November 2006 the court ordered the first applicant to pay the expert’s fees. The first applicant appealed on 10 November 2006. On 29 March 2007 the Celje Higher Court upheld the order of the first-instance court, finding that the first applicant had undertaken to pay the fees for the expert whose appointment he had proposed.', '43.  In the meantime, on 24 January 2007, the first applicant received the expert opinion.', '44.  On 27 February 2007 the court scheduled a hearing for 5 March 2007, which was adjourned sine die at M.E.’s request. M.E. stated that she would not be available during that period as she had given birth in December 2006 and was breastfeeding.', '45.  On 2 March 2007 the first applicant lodged a supervisory appeal, relying on section 6 of the Act on Protection of the Right to a Hearing without Undue Delay (“the 2006 Act”).', '46.  On 23 March 2007 the President of the court, relying on section 6, paragraph 4 of the 2006 Act, replied to the supervisory appeal stating that the hearing had been held on 5 March 2007, that is, within four months of receipt of the supervisory appeal.', '47.  On 7 September 2007 the court held a hearing. It joined proceedings Pn 22/2005 to the existing proceedings. Since the first applicant insisted that the second applicant act as a second plaintiff and be represented in the proceedings by a curator ad litem (see paragraph 24 above), the court adjourned the hearing and appointed a lawyer to represent the second applicant.', '48. On the same day the first applicant lodged preliminary written submissions in which he expressed his dissatisfaction with certain parts of the expert opinion and requested that a new expert be appointed.', '49.  On 3 October 2007 the first applicant lodged a motion for a deadline, relying on section 8 of the 2006 Act. On 15 October 2007 the President of the Celje Higher Court rejected (zavreči) the motion. He found that the first applicant had not sufficiently explained his allegations of undue delay and therefore failed to satisfy the requirements of section 5, paragraph 2, point 5 of the 2006 Act.', '50.  A hearing was scheduled for 9 November 2007 but was cancelled at the request of the second applicant’s representative.', '51.  The next hearing was held on 10 January 2008. At the hearing the parties agreed on new access arrangements. Under the terms of that agreement, the first applicant also withdrew his application for custody rights. In addition, the parties withdrew two other claims – one criminal complaint for defamation lodged by M.E. against the first applicant and a civil complaint pursued by the first applicant against M.E. On that day the proceedings were “finally resolved” (see paragraph 79 below).', '52.  On 24 May 2004 the first applicant lodged a request for access arrangements in separate proceedings. In his request the first applicant noted that the access order issued in administrative proceedings had been ineffective and requested that the court grant an interim access order which would ensure contact between the applicants. In this connection, he requested to be granted the right to pick up the second applicant at her school, which would prevent M.E. from hindering the access. In July and September 2004 the court tried to serve the request on M.E., but to no avail. The court then ordered that the request be served through M.E.’s employer.', '53.  In his written submissions of 25 October 2004 the first applicant included the second applicant as a claimant.', '54.  On 26 October 2004 the Šentjur pri Celju Local Court held a hearing. It found that it lacked jurisdiction to decide in the case and referred it to the Celje District Court.', '55.  On 23 December 2004 the applicants requested the Šentjur pri Celju Local Court to transfer the case file to the Celje District Court.', '56.  On 29 December 2004 the Šentjur pri Celju Local Court informed the first applicant that the case could not be transferred as the decision concerning the court’s lack of jurisdiction had not yet become final owing to the lack of success in serving it on M.E.', '57.  On 14 January 2005 the case was transferred to the Celje District Court and was registered under number Pn 22/2005.', '58.  On 11 February 2005 the first applicant requested priority.', '59.  The court held a hearing on 24 March 2005 in the absence of M.E. The first applicant testified that he had had access to the second applicant only on three occasions, namely on 12 May 2001, on 5 May 2004 and on 23 December 2004. The judge informed the first applicant that an interim access order could not be issued as the final access order issued in administrative proceedings was still in force.', '60.  On 24 and 25 March 2005 the first applicant filed written submissions.', '61.  On 4 April 2005 the Celje District Court asked the first applicant to enclose a confirmation from the social welfare centre that an attempt had been made to reach an agreement concerning access rights as stipulated in the Marriage and Family Relations Act. It also noted that the advance for the payment of expert fees had not been paid. It appears from this decision that the second applicant, represented by her father, was also considered a claimant in the proceedings.', '62.  On 17 May 2005 the court dismissed the request for new access arrangements as the first applicant had failed to submit the required documents. It seems, however, that this decision did not become final as on 25 May 2005 the first applicant successfully requested that the proceedings be joined to proceedings P 667/2003 (see paragraph 30 above).'], 'applicants': ['EBERHARD', 'M.'], 'defendants': ['SLOVENIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8', '6', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['100', '101', '102', '116', '14', '15', '16', '22', '23', '28', '38', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '72', '73', '8', '98', '99'], '6': ['76', '79']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19, 24, 34, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19, 24, 34, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58], 'explained_indices': [7, 21, 20, 41, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 48, 47, 31, 32, 33, 34, 19, 46, 18, 16, 40, 55, 54, 53, 52, 39, 17, 38, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 9, 45, 44, 29, 50, 51, 56, 49, 43, 58, 37, 36, 35, 30, 57, 28, 42, 4, 8, 0, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.050350014, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074227, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.024074256, -0.11326939, -0.14486635, -0.14696087, -0.16554087, -0.1885273, -0.20000012, -0.22732241, -0.50430673], 'number_of_sentences': 59, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Baku.', '6.  The applicant was a co-founder and director of a public association named “The Journalist Inquiry Centre” (“Jurnalist Araşdırmaları Mərkəzi” İctimai Birliyi), established on 15 July 2001. This was a non-profit organisation aimed at promoting the profession of a journalist and freedom of mass media in Azerbaijan.', \"7.  On 12 September 2001 the association's founders filed a request for its state registration with the Ministry of Justice (hereinafter also referred to as the “Ministry”), the government authority responsible for the state registration of legal entities. In accordance with the domestic law, a non-governmental organisation acquired the status of a legal entity only upon its state registration by the Ministry.\", \"8.  According to the Government, by a letter of 11 October 2001 the Head of the Department for State Registration of Legal Entities of the Ministry of Justice replied to the applicant that the association's charter contained a number of deficiencies and requested the founders to revise the charter accordingly (the Government submitted a copy of this letter). According to the applicant, the founders did not receive such a letter and, in fact, did not receive any formal reply from the Ministry for more than one year and four months.\", \"9.  In the meantime, the founders made certain amendments to the association's charter. On 12 September 2002 they re-submitted their registration request together with the new version of the association's charter. In the cover letter for this request, the applicant noted that the founders had made an original request one year earlier but, despite two follow-up letters of 25 September and 2 November 2001 and a meeting with the Ministry official, they had not received any formal reply from the Ministry.\", \"10.  In January 2003 the applicant filed a lawsuit against the Ministry with the Yasamal District Court, complaining of the Ministry's failure to take any action within the ten-day time-limit specified by law.\", \"11.  While the examination of the lawsuit was pending, on 27 January 2003 the Ministry returned the registration documents to the applicant “without taking any action”, i.e. without issuing a state registration certificate or an official refusal to register the association. In the cover letter, the Ministry noted that the association's charter did not comply with Articles 3.1 and 10.3 of the Law on Non-Governmental Organisations. Specifically, the charter did not provide for the internal procedure to challenge a decision to terminate membership in the association. Moreover, the official name of the association allegedly did not mention its organisational legal form. It appears that the Ministry's letter of 27 January 2003 referred to the deficiencies in the association's original charter, although these deficiencies had already been rectified in the revised version of the charter submitted to the Ministry on 12 September 2002.\", \"12.  On 10 February 2003 the Yasamal District Court dismissed the applicant's claim, finding nothing unlawful in the actions of the Ministry. The court found that the association's charter had not been drafted in accordance with the requirements of the Law on Non-Governmental Organisations and, therefore, the Ministry's refusal to register the association had been lawful.\", \"13.  The applicant appealed. On 24 June 2003 the Court of Appeal upheld the first instance court's judgment.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Michalovce.', '7.  The applicant was married. The marriage produced two children: a daughter who was born in 1997 and a son who was born in 2001.', '8.  On 2 November 2002 the applicant filed a criminal complaint against her husband with the Michalovce District Police Department (Obvodné oddelenie Policajného zboru). She accused him of having assaulted and beaten her with an electric cable the previous day. She submitted a medical report by a trauma specialist indicating that her injuries would incapacitate her from work for up to seven days. The applicant also stated that there was a long history of physical and psychological abuse by her husband.', \"9.  At an unspecified time between 15 and 18 November 2002 the applicant and her husband went to the District Police Station. They sought to withdraw the applicant's criminal complaint. A police officer, Mr H., advised them that, in order to avoid a prosecution, they would have to produce a medical report showing that after the incident on 1 November 2002 the applicant had not been incapacitated from work for more than six days. The applicant produced such a report on 21 November 2002.\", '10.  On 26 November 2002 officer H. decided that the above matter was to be dealt with under the Minor Offences Act (Law no. 372/1990 Coll.) and, under section 60(3)(a) of that Act, decided to take no further action (odloženie veci).', \"11.  During the night of 26 to 27 December 2002 a relative of the applicant called the emergency service of the District Police Department to report that the applicant's husband had a shotgun and was threatening to kill himself and the children. The applicant herself made a similar phone call later that night. The phone calls were received by a police officer, Mr B., who instructed a police officer, Mr P.Š., to arrange for a police patrol to visit the premises. The patrol found the applicant in the village of Tušická Nová Ves. The applicant's husband had left the scene prior to their arrival. The policemen took the applicant to her parents' home and invited her to come to the police station the following morning so that a formal record of the incident could be drawn up.\", '12.  In the morning of 27 December 2002 the applicant, accompanied by her brother, went to the Trhovište District Police Station, where she spoke to a police officer, Mr M.Š.', '13.  In the morning of 31 December 2002 the applicant and her brother went to the Michalovce District Police Station, where she talked to officer H. She enquired about her criminal complaint of 2 November 2002 and also mentioned the incident of the night of 26 to 27 December 2002.', \"14.  On 31 December 2002 between 11 a.m. and 11.15 a.m. the applicant's husband shot their two children and himself dead.\", \"15.  On 31 January 2003 the Košice Branch of the Police Inspection Service (Úrad inšpekčnej služby Policajného zboru – “the Inspection Service”) charged officer M.Š. with abuse of public authority (Article 158 § 1 (c) of the Criminal Code) on the ground that on 27 December 2002 he had failed to accept and duly register the applicant's criminal complaint and to commence criminal proceedings against the applicant's husband immediately.\", '16.  On 3 February 2003 the Inspection Service charged officer P.Š. with dereliction of duty (Article 159 § 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code) on the ground that on the night of 26 to 27 December 2002 he had failed to take appropriate action in response to the emergency calls from the applicant and her relative, in particular, to launch a criminal investigation, to keep a  proper record of the emergency calls and to advise the next shift of the situation and of the fact that the applicant would be visiting the police station the following morning to file a formal criminal complaint.', \"17.  On 7 February 2003 the Inspection Service charged officer H. with abuse of public authority (Article 158 § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code) for altering records pertaining to the applicant's criminal complaint of 2 November 2002 and arbitrarily treating it as a minor offence calling for no further action.\", \"18.  On 12 February 2003 the Inspection Service commenced criminal proceedings against an unknown police officer for abuse of public authority (Article 158 § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code) in connection with an allegation that on 31 December 2002 he had wrongfully refused to register a criminal complaint from the applicant concerning the incident of the night of 26 to 27 December 2002. These proceedings later resulted in charges against officer H. On the same day the Inspection Service charged officer B. with abuse of public authority (Article 158 § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code) on the ground that on the night of 26 to 27 December 2002 he had failed to take appropriate action in connection with the allegations that the applicant's husband had threatened violence. He was accused, inter alia, of having omitted to carry out a search in the register of firearms and firearms licence holders.\", \"19.  On 30 April 2003 the Prešov District Military Prosecutor (Vojenský obvodný prokurátor) discontinued the proceedings that had been commenced on 12 February 2003 and had subsequently led to the charges against officer H. After examining documentary evidence and testimony by the applicant, the accused and witnesses, the prosecutor found that the purpose of the applicant's conversation with officer H. on the morning of 31 December 2002 had not been to lodge a new formal criminal complaint against her husband. She had merely sought information about the state of the proceedings further to her criminal complaint of 2 November 2002 and there was no suspicion that officer H. had committed any criminal offence.\", \"20.  On 28 July 2003 the Košice Regional Investigation Office (Krajský úrad vyšetrovania) discontinued the criminal proceedings instituted against officer H. on 7 February 2003. Observing that he had acted in good faith and in accordance with the applicant's express wishes, the investigator decided that the actions of officer H. had not involved the element of social gravity that was requisite in order to constitute a criminal offence. The investigator also observed that officer H. had already been discharged from the police and that therefore no disciplinary proceedings could be brought against him. The applicant challenged this decision by means of a complaint which the District Military Prosecutor declared inadmissible on 15 August 2003, finding under Article 142 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) that she had no right to make it.\", '21.  On 4 August 2003 the District Military Prosecutor summoned officers B., P.Š. and M.Š. for trial in the Michalovce District Court (Okresný súd) on a charge of negligent dereliction of duty (Article 159 §§ 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code) in connection with the above events. The summons set out in detail the internal regulations of the Ministry of the Interior the officers were alleged to have breached.', \"22.  On 20 October 2003, following a hearing on the same day in which the applicant took part through the intermediary of her lawyer, the District Court dismissed the summons. It found that the criminal offence of dereliction of duty presupposed a complete or enduring failure to discharge the duty. Merely impeding the discharge of the duty was not enough. It found that in the present case the officers' actions did not amount to such a failure to discharge their duty and that the connection between their actions and the tragedy of 31 December 2002 was not sufficiently direct.\\nThe applicant appeared in the District Court as a witness and was not served with a copy of the judgment.\", \"23.  On 21 January 2004 the Košice Regional Court (Krajský súd) dismissed an appeal by the District Military Prosecutor against the judgment of 20 October 2003. No further appeal was available.\\nThe applicant was neither officially informed about the appellate proceedings nor served with a copy of the Regional Court's judgment.\", \"24.  The Prosecutor General, however, challenged the Regional Court's decision of 21 January 2004 by lodging a complaint in the interests of the law (sťažnosť pre porušenie zákona) in the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd).\", \"25.  On 29 September 2004 the Supreme Court quashed both the Regional Court's decision of 21 January 2004 and the District Court's judgment of 20 October 2003. The Supreme Court found that the lower courts had assessed the evidence illogically, that they had failed to take account of all the relevant facts and that they had drawn incorrect conclusions. The Supreme Court found that it was clear that the accused officers had acted in dereliction of their duties. It concluded that there was a direct causal link between their unlawful actions and the fatal consequence. The Supreme Court remitted the case to the District Court for reconsideration and pointed out that, pursuant to Article 270 § 4 of the CCP, the latter was bound by its above legal views.\", \"26.  On 14 March 2006 the District Court held a hearing in which the applicant took part in the capacity of a witness. Following the hearing, on the same day, the District Court found officers B., P.Š. and M.Š. guilty as charged and sentenced them to, respectively, six, four and four months' imprisonment. All sentences were suspended for 12 months. It was found that the accused had negligently breached the applicable service regulations and had thereby caused the death of the applicant's children. When determining the sentence, the District Court took into account inter alia the fact that the accused had thus far been leading honest lives, their work appraisals were positive and officers B. and M.Š. had already been discharged from service in the police. All the accused and the public prosecution service appealed. Officer B. later withdrew his appeal.\", \"27.  On 26 September 2006 the Regional Court heard and dismissed the outstanding appeals. It found that the District Court had adequately established and correctly assessed the facts and had drawn accurate legal conclusions both as regards the guilt and the sentences. No ordinary remedy was available against the Regional Court's judgment.\", \"28.  On 26 February 2003 the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, lodged a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution with the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd). She formally directed her complaint against the District Police Department, maintaining that its officers' failure to act had led to a violation of her right to protection of her personal integrity (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution), her right to protection from unjustified interference with her private life (Article 19 § 2 of the Constitution) and her right to legal protection (Article 46 § 1 of the Constitution). She asserted that the police had been well aware of the situation that had preceded the tragedy of 31 December 2002 and, in breach of their positive obligations, had failed to take the necessary action. She claimed that responsibility for this failure lay with the District Police Department. She also maintained that the criminal proceedings which were currently pending could not afford her complete redress for the damage she had sustained.\", \"29.  On 2 July 2003 a three-judge bench of the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. It observed that the Constitutional Court only had jurisdiction if the matter concerned did not fall within the jurisdiction of another authority. Its power to award just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage could only be exercised if the Constitutional Court had substantive jurisdiction over the matter. In the present case the primary issue was whether the officers who had dealt with the applicant's case had complied with the applicable regulations. That issue fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and was being examined in the criminal proceedings which were currently under way and in which the applicant could claim standing to intervene as an aggrieved party. A ruling on that issue could nevertheless also be sought before the civil courts. To that end, the bench observed that the applicant's range of options was not limited to actions of the type specifically provided for by statute. The bench concluded that, in these circumstances, the applicant's complaint was premature and the Constitutional Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it.\", \"30.  The presiding judge, however, did not share the majority view and gave a dissenting opinion. According to him, in view of its primary purpose, namely to uphold constitutionality, the Constitutional Court was free to examine complaints under the legal provisions which it considered to be the most relevant. The present case was to be examined primarily from the standpoint of the right to life and, in particular, the positive obligations inherent in that right. Contrary to the bench's finding, and in breach of the positive obligations in question, there were no remedies available to the applicant under civil or criminal law permitting her to claim and obtain adequate and sufficient redress for her alleged non‑pecuniary damage. He pointed out that not even the bench had clearly identified the remedies available to the applicant for that purpose. Finally, the presiding judge said that the principle that the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction was subsidiary, which was set out in Article 127 of the Constitution, was to be interpreted with a degree of flexibility in the light of the circumstances of each particular case. In his view, the Constitutional Court was the only authority to which the applicant could have made her claim for compensation for non‑pecuniary damage in the present case. It therefore should not have been precluded from examining the case by the possible existence of other remedies which in any event were not complete.\", \"31.  On 26 February 2004 the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, lodged a fresh complaint against the District Police Department with the Constitutional Court. She reiterated the arguments she had submitted in the first complaint and added that the criminal proceedings had ended without producing any positive results in respect of her complaints. She maintained that she had no remedy before any other authority as regards the non-pecuniary damage she had suffered. She concluded that the Constitutional Court was therefore called upon to deal with the merits of her case. She alleged a violation of her children's right to life (Article 15 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution and Article 2 § 1 of the Convention). She further alleged a violation of her right to protection of her personal integrity and privacy (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution), her right to protection from unjustified interference with her private and family life (Article 19 § 2 of the Constitution), her right to legal protection (Article 46 § 1 of the Constitution), her right to security of person (Article 5 of the Convention) and her right to respect for her private and family life (Article 8 of the Convention).\", \"32.  On 8 September 2004 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint of 26 February 2004 inadmissible, holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain it. In this context the Constitutional Court held that the principal questions of whether there had been any illegal action causing damage to the applicant and who was responsible for it fell to be determined by the ordinary courts. More specifically, the question of whether a crime had been committed in connection with the events complained of was to be determined in criminal proceedings. The Constitutional Court noted that in the criminal proceedings in the present case the applicant had failed to claim standing as an aggrieved party, which would have given her a series of procedural rights enabling her to influence their outcome. The fact that the criminal courts had sole jurisdiction in the matter meant that the Constitutional Court had power to intervene only if the criminal courts had acted manifestly arbitrarily. The applicant had, however, put forward no arguments to that effect. The Constitutional Court further held that, in any event, in so far as the complaint pertained to the District Police Department's failure to take action in November and December 2002, it had been submitted outside the statutory two-month time-limit. Furthermore, the applicant had no right of petition, either of her own or on behalf of her late children, in respect of the alleged violation of their right to life. Finally, part of the second complaint was in any event inadmissible as it raised issues that were res judicata by virtue of the decision of 2 July 2003.\"], 'applicants': ['KONTROVA'], 'defendants': ['SLOVAKIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '8', '2'], 'violated_articles': ['2', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['18', '21', '25'], '8': ['55']}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 15, 19], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 15, 19], 'explained_indices': [1, 0, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 25, 26, 2, 5, 3, 4], 'explained_distances': [0.03177815, 0.02684893, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.026809413, 0.023049284, 0.017443497, -0.001483269, -0.0056009144], 'number_of_sentences': 27, 'article_id': 2, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Iaşi.', '5.  On 1 October 2002 the applicant was appointed to the post of director of the Economics Department of the Romanian Waters Agency (“the Agency”), a public institution under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Water and the Environment (“the Ministry”).', \"6.  In July 2003 the audit office of the Ministry investigated the Agency's activity and discovered some irregularities. As a result, on 21 July 2003 the Agency dismissed the applicant for alleged mismanagement.\", \"7.  On 5 August 2003 the Ministry certified mismanagement on the applicant's part and on 12 August 2003 it lodged a criminal complaint against her. It appears from the file that the proceedings are still pending.\", \"8.  On 26 November 2003 the Bucharest County Court set aside the decision of 21 July 2003 and ordered the applicant's reinstatement and payment of the salary due until her effective reinstatement. The court found that no preliminary investigations had been carried out prior to that decision.\\nThat judgment was quashed on grounds of incompatibility ratione loci, but on 15 April 2005 the Iaşi County Court set aside that decision and ordered the applicant's reinstatement and payment of the difference between the salary earned before and after the decision, until the applicant's effective reinstatement. That ruling was upheld by a final decision of 4 October 2005 by the Iaşi Court of Appeal.\", \"9.  On 12 January 2004 the agency reinstated the applicant in her previous position, but on 2 February 2004 it suspended her from office. That decision was based on the existence of a criminal complaint against the applicant, and stated that during the applicant's suspension, which would remain in place until the end of the criminal proceedings, she would be offered another post corresponding to her qualifications. On 3 February 2004 she was appointed as economic adviser in a local branch of the Agency.\", \"10.  On 30 June 2004 the Iaşi County Court set aside the decision of 2 February 2004 and ordered the Agency to reinstate the applicant in her previous position as director of the Economics Department and to pay her the difference between the salary earned before and after that decision. The court considered that decision to be unlawful, inter alia, because the criminal complaint against the applicant had not been lodged by the Agency, which was the applicant's employer, but by the Ministry, which had no professional relationship with the applicant.\", '11.  On 27 July 2004 the Agency therefore declared void its decision of 2 February 2004, reinstated the applicant in her previous post and paid her the outstanding salary.', \"12.  However, on 2 December 2004 the Iaşi Court of Appeal, by a final decision, allowed an appeal on points of law by the Agency and dismissed the applicant's complaint against the decision of 2 February 2004.\", '13.  According to the Agency, on 6 August 2004 it lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant.', '14.  On 16 August 2004 the Agency again suspended her from her post, on the basis of that criminal complaint.', '15.  On 29 October 2004 the Iaşi County Court set aside that decision and ordered the Agency to reinstate the applicant in her previous post and to pay her, from 16 August 2004 until her effective reinstatement, compensation for pecuniary damage in the form of an increased and updated salary, together with all the other benefits to which she would have been entitled. The court held that the Agency had not proved that it had lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant.', '16.  On 20 January 2005 the Iaşi Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed an appeal on points of law by the Agency. However, in its reasoning the court found that the decision of 16 August 2004 had been unlawful because the courts had eventually confirmed the previous decision of 2 February 2004 suspending the applicant (see paragraph 12 above).', \"17.  On 31 January 2005 the applicant requested the Agency to enforce the judgment of 29 October 2004 (see paragraph 15 above). Following a refusal by the Agency, the applicant lodged a criminal complaint on 27 February 2005 against its Director-General. Eventually, on 5 February 2007, the Bucharest District Court acquitted the Director-General on the ground that his conduct had not amounted to a criminal offence, but ordered him to pay a criminal fine. The court also noted that the Agency's decision of 2 February 2004 had been declared void by its subsequent decision of 27 July 2004 reinstating the applicant (see paragraph 11 above). That judgment became final.\", '18.  On 2 February 2005 the applicant requested assistance from the re-named Ministry of the Environment and Water, under whose authority the Agency continued to function, with a view to her reinstatement. On 13 May 2005 the Ministry replied that the judgment of 29 October 2004 was enforceable.', \"19.  Between 8 February 2005 and 4 July 2007 the applicant made successive requests to a bailiff to attach the Agency's bank assets in order to recover the salary due to her, increased and updated in line with inflation. Several account statements issued between June 2005 and December 2007 certified payment by the Agency of the amounts claimed by the applicant.\\nIn particular, on 31 March 2005 she requested the bailiff to oblige the Agency to reinstate her. In her request of 4 July 2007, the applicant acknowledged that she had recovered salary for the period between 16 August 2004 and 31 March 2007, but that the Agency had still not reinstated her.\", '20.  On 30 August 2006 the Ministry of the Environment and Water informed the applicant that it had requested the Agency to enforce the judgment in her favour.', '21.  According to the Agency, the applicant had not asked to be reinstated, preferring to claim the corresponding salary. The applicant contested this assertion.', '22.  On 1 October 2007 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Agency seeking reassessment of her salary on the basis of increases and updates for the period 2003-2007, alleging that she was still receiving a salary at the 2003 level. She also claimed payment of social security contributions on her behalf.', '23.  On 12 September 2008 the Iaşi County Court refused her request. Having regard to the date on which it was lodged, the court found that her claim relating to the period from 21 July 2003 to 1 October 2004 was time‑barred. As to the rest of the period, it considered that the decision of 2 February 2004 which had suspended her from office was still in effect and therefore the applicant was not entitled to a salary corresponding to the post of director. Since it had dismissed her main claim for payment of salary, the court also dismissed her secondary request for payment of social security contributions.', \"24.  On 20 January 2009 the Iaşi Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant and upheld the decision of the first-instance court, but varied its reasoning. Thus, it found that the decision of 2 February 2004 had been actually rendered void by the subsequent decision of 27 July 2004 to reinstate the applicant (see paragraph 11 above). The court further noted that the decision of 27 July 2004 had been issued in accordance with the judgment of 30 June 2004, but had not been annulled by the Agency following the final decision of 2 December 2004 (see paragraph 12 above). Therefore, the professional relationship between the applicant and the Agency had not been suspended.\\nThe court further noted that, under the judgments of 15 April 2005 (see paragraph 8 above) and 29 October 2004 (see paragraph 15 above), the Agency had an obligation to reinstate the applicant in her previous post and to pay her, until her effective reinstatement, compensation for pecuniary damage in the form of an increased and updated salary. It also found that following the attachment of the Agency's accounts she had received the amounts due from the Agency.\\nWhile her claim for the period from 21 July 2003 to 1 October 2004 was time-barred, the applicant was not entitled to a salary after that date either, since she had not been reinstated, but only to damages corresponding to an increased and updated salary. The court held that the above-mentioned judgments had already been enforced by means of attachment of the Agency's accounts. However, the amount of damages paid could be challenged by an objection to execution under Article 399 of the Code of Civil Procedure, not by an action for reassessment of salary such as that brought by the applicant. Finally, since the Agency could not be ordered to pay a salary to the applicant, it could not be ordered to pay social security contributions on her behalf either.\"], 'applicants': ['URSAN'], 'defendants': ['ROMANIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-1', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1', '6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['12', '24']}, 'silver_rationales': [8, 20], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [8, 20], 'explained_indices': [4, 6, 5, 0, 3, 2, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 10, 11, 19, 9, 8, 7, 12, 20, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.2330749, 0.15109694, 0.09045428, 0.08352691, 0.07822609, 0.06037748, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0028887987, -0.0072662234], 'number_of_sentences': 21, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1980 and lived until his arrest in the town of Dyatkovo in the Bryansk Region. He is serving his sentence in the correctional colony in the village of Kamenka in the Bryansk Region.', '7.  On 14 December 2002 the police arrested the applicant and brought him to the Dyatkovskiy District police station.', \"8.  On the same day a police officer, I., who had taken part in the applicant's arrest, drew up a report, informing the chief of the Dyatkovskiy District police station that a man had approached him and his fellow officers in a street, complaining that he had been beaten up and robbed. The applicant had passed by and the victim had identified him as the robber. The applicant had tried to escape but he had been apprehended and taken to the police station. The report did not indicate whether force or special means had been used during the arrest.\", \"9.  The applicant lodged a complaint with the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor's office, seeking institution of criminal proceedings against the arresting police officers. In particular, he alleged that the police officers had unlawfully applied force against him during the arrest.\", \"10.  On 30 December 2002 a deputy Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor issued a decision, finding that there was no case to answer and dismissing the applicant's complaint. The decision stated that on 14 December 2002, after the applicant had committed the robbery, police officers had stopped him in a street and had ordered him to get into a police car. The applicant had refused, had punched police officer Ka. in the face and had attempted to escape, threatening the officers with a knife. Police officer I. had hit the applicant with a rubber truncheon on the arm, forcing him to drop the knife. Subsequently, the police officers had forced the applicant into the car. The deputy prosecutor concluded that there had been no indication of a criminal offence in the police officers' actions. The applicant was served with a copy of that decision.\", '11.  According to the applicant, after being taken to the Dyatkovskiy District police station on 14 December 2002, he had been placed in a cell. An assistant police officer on duty, P., had approached the applicant and hit him with a rubber truncheon approximately ten times on the left side of the body and once in the face. An officer on duty, S., had entered the cell and had started beating the applicant as well. The beatings had continued for an hour and a half. The applicant had subsequently been placed in the detention facility of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department.', \"12.  The Government, relying on the information provided by the Prosecutor General's office, submitted that on 14 December 2002 the applicant had been taken in a state of alcoholic intoxication to the duty unit of the Dyatkovskiy District police station. After being placed in a cell for administrative detainees, he had started kicking the door, using obscene language and ignoring the police officers' orders to stop the unlawful behaviour. Police officer P. had entered the cell and hit the applicant a number of times in the back with a rubber truncheon. After officer P. had left, the applicant had stripped to the waist and started pushing the door. The police officers, using force, had transferred him to another cell. While he was being escorted to the new cell and was passing the desk of an officer on duty, the applicant had started spitting on the desk communication board. Officer P. had thus been forced to hit the applicant with a rubber truncheon. In the new cell the applicant had continued kicking the door. The police officers had had no choice but to handcuff the applicant to a metal bar, so he could not reach the door. Shortly after, when the applicant had calmed down, the handcuffs had been removed. No force had been applied against the applicant after that incident.\", '13.  On 15 December 2002, on admission to the detention facility of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department, an officer on duty examined the applicant and drew up a report, recording the following injuries on his body: bruises on the chest, numerous injuries on the back, bruises on the left hip and buttock, injuries on the forehead, face and left cheek. As shown by the documents presented by the parties, on 16 December 2002 an emergency doctor was called to attend to the applicant in response to his complaints about severe pain in the jaw and chest. The doctor examined the applicant, noted his injuries and, suspecting that he could have had a rib fracture, recommended an examination by a traumatologist.', '14.  Five days later the applicant complained to the head of the detention facility about the beatings in the police station and sought the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers.', '15.  On 20 December 2002 the applicant was examined in the medical division of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department and a report was drawn up. According to the report, he had a hypodermic injury on the left side of the chest. The injury measured 15 centimetres in length and 5 centimetres in width and resulted from a blow by a rubber truncheon.', '16.  Ten days later the applicant, being diagnosed with encephalomyelopolyneurotis, was admitted to the hospital of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department where he stayed until his transfer, on 22 January 2003, to Bryansk prison hospital no. OB-21/2. He remained in that hospital until 4 February 2003 with a diagnosis of “consequences of neuritis of the left fibular nerve”.', '17.  In the meantime the applicant lodged a complaint with the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor, describing the beatings in the police station on 14 December 2002 and asking for an investigation into the incident.', '18.  On 23 January 2003 a deputy Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings against police officers P. and S., finding that their actions, in a situation where the applicant had behaved in an unruly manner, had been lawful and proportionate.', \"19.  On 4 April 2003 a deputy Bryansk Regional Prosecutor annulled the decision of 23 January 2003 and authorised a re-examination of the applicant's ill-treatment complaints. The relevant part of the decision read as follows:\\n“The decision [of 23 January 2003] was manifestly ill-founded and premature, as the investigation had been incomplete; the circumstances in which the injuries to [the applicant] had been caused were not fully examined; [the applicant] was not questioned and [he] did not undergo an examination by a medical expert; administrative and criminal arrestees detained in [the police station] were not questioned about the events; the traffic police officers who had brought [the applicant] to the [police station] were not questioned; therefore [the decision] should be annulled.”\\nThe deputy prosecutor also drew up a list of measures which should be taken in the course of the new round of the investigation, including a medical examination and questioning of the applicant, and the establishment and questioning of possible eyewitnesses among those persons who had been detained with the applicant.\", '20.  On 14 April 2003 a deputy Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor, in a decision worded identically to the one issued on 23 January 2003, once again refused to institute criminal proceedings against officers S. and P., confirming the lawfulness of their actions.', \"21.  On 6 August 2003 the Bryansk Regional Prosecutor informed the applicant that the decision of 14 April 2003 had been quashed, that an additional investigation into his complaints was to be conducted and that the case file had been sent back to the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor's office. When quashing the decision of 14 April 2003, the Bryansk Regional Prosecutor's office repeated the list of investigative steps to be taken.\", \"22.  On 22 August 2003 an assistant Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor dismissed the applicant's complaints against police officers S. and P., finding no case of ill-treatment. The decision of 22 August 2003 was similar in its wording to those issued on 23 January and 14 April 2003.\", '23.  In October 2003 a neuropathologist examined the applicant and diagnosed him with asthenovegetative syndrome related to a head injury.', '24.  On 21 October 2003 the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor annulled the decision of 22 August 2003, finding that the investigation had been incomplete. A new round of investigation was authorised.', \"25.  Three days later, on 24 October 2003, an investigator of the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor's office once again dismissed the applicant's complaint, repeating the findings made in the decision of 22 August 2003. In addition, the investigator recounted statements made by the applicant, by an investigator who had interviewed him on 14 December 2002, by a doctor who had examined the applicant on 16 December 2002, by two persons who had been detained with the applicant on 14 December 2002, and by the victim whom the applicant had robbed. The applicant had maintained his complaints. The investigator had testified that he had not seen any injuries on the applicant and that the latter had not made any complaints. The doctor had stated that she had been called to attend to the applicant who had complained about pain in the jaw and on the left side of the chest. She had examined the applicant and recorded injuries on the chest and lower jaw. She had presumed that the applicant had had a rib fracture. She had indicated that the applicant had to be examined by a traumatologist. The inmates had testified that the applicant had been placed in their cell in the second half of the day on 14 December 2002. He had shown them injuries on his back and complained that he had been beaten up by the police officers. The victim had testified that he had not seen any injuries on the applicant's body on the day of the robbery.\\nThe investigator concluded that officers S. and P. had acted in full compliance with requirements of Articles 13 and 14 of the Police Act.\", \"26.  On 19 May 2004 the Dyatkovo Town Court, acting on the applicant's appeal against the decision of 24 October 2003, confirmed the findings made by the investigator. The Town Court noted that the officers' actions had been beyond reproach, the lawfulness and proportionality of their actions being manifest.\", \"27.  On 23 July 2004 the Bryansk Regional Court quashed the decision of 19 May 2004 and remitted the case for re-examination to the Town Court. The Regional Court held, in particular, as follows:\\n“At the same time it is impossible to conclude that the decision of the investigator refusing institution of criminal proceedings was lawful and well-founded, taking into account the following considerations.\\nAs shown by the material from investigation no. 1-13 opened upon the [applicant's] complaint, the investigator's conclusions drawn up in the decision [of 24 October 2003] do not correspond to the circumstances of the case which were established in the course of the investigation. Moreover, the investigation was incomplete.\\nThe fact of [the applicant's] arrest and [his] placement in the detention facility of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department on 14 December 2002, at 7.20 p.m., was confirmed by an extract from the registration log of persons brought to the police department... According to an extract from the record of medical examinations of persons detained in the detention facility of the Dyatkovskiy District Police Department, on 15 December 2002, at the time of the placement, [the applicant] had injuries on the left and right sides of the body, the left and right buttocks, injuries on the forehead, the bridge of his nose, the left cheek, and numerous injuries on the back.\\nAs is apparent from the statements by [the victim of the robbery], on 14 December 2002, at about 7 p.m., [the applicant] had no visible injuries.\\nThe decision [of 24 October 2003] did not indicate whether it had been established that [the applicant] had been injured by officers of the police department during his arrest.\\nTherefore, in the course of the investigation the investigator of the prosecutor's office did not establish the time, place, extent, or method and means of infliction of the injuries which [the applicant] had been found to have during his examination on 15 December 2002; the severity [of those injuries] was likewise not established.\\nAccordingly, [the court] cannot regard as rightful and substantiated the investigator's finding that [the applicant] received injuries as a result of the two blows to his back made by Mr P. and by [the applicant's] knocking on the door and walls and by his being handcuffed.\\nThe investigator did not examine, and thus did not evaluate, the [applicant's] statements concerning the effect of the injuries which had led to his having obtained a leg disease... accordingly, [an investigator] did not check information concerning [the applicant's] stay in hospital; a diagnosis which had been pronounced at the end of the treatment; the severity of the damage caused to [the applicant's] health leading to the diagnosis; the existence of a causal link between the injuries which he had been found to have on 15 December 2002 and his illness.\\nIn the decision the investigator refers to statements by Mr K. and Mr G., from which it transpires that they were arrested and detained in cell no. 7, when on 14 December 2002 after dinner, [the applicant] was placed there, allegedly in a state of intoxication; [he had] injuries and explained that they had been caused by the police officers when he had offered resistance to the arresting officers.\\nAt the same time, as is apparent from the material in investigation file no. 1/13, on 14 December 2002, at 11.50 p.m., [the applicant] was placed in a cell where Mr Sh., Mr T., and Mr D. were being held. On 15 December 2002, at 4 p.m., [the applicant] was placed in cell no. 7 with Mr G. and Mr K.\\nIn these circumstances, the [Regional] Court considers that the conclusions of the [Town] Court about the lawfulness and rightfulness of the investigator's decision of 24 October 2003, concerning the refusal to institute criminal proceedings, do not correspond to the circumstances of the case, and thus the decision of [19 May 2003] should be quashed and the case should be remitted for a new court examination.”\", \"28.  On 4 November 2004 the Dyatkovo Town Court accepted the applicant's complaint and annulled the investigator's decision of 24 October 2003, endorsing the reasoning of the Regional Court. The decision of 4 November 2004 was upheld on appeal on 24 December 2004.\", \"29.  On 19 November 2004 the investigator of the Dyatkovo Town prosecutor's office refused to institute criminal proceedings against officers S. and P. The wording of that decision was similar to that of the decision of 24 October 2003, but with an additional paragraph which read as follows:\\n“[The applicant] in his numerous complaints stated that, as a result of being beaten by the police officers, his legs had been paralysed; however, his statement is refuted by the conclusions of a forensic medical examination which had been performed [in compliance with the Town Court's decision of 4 November 2004] on the basis of [the applicant's] medical records from facilities nos. IZ-32/1 [detention facility of the Police Department] and OB-21/2...; on the basis of which it was established that the illnesses with which [the applicant] had been diagnosed in those facilities...do not have a pathogenetic causal link to his injuries and that [the illnesses] are independent diseases of a non-traumatic character. When [the applicant] asked for medical assistance on 15 December 2002, he had an injury on the forehead and the nose bridge, an injury on the left cheek-bone, bruises on the left and right sides of the chest, and bruises on the back and buttocks. Those injuries were caused by numerous applications of firm blunt objects to those parts [of the body], which could have been carried out by blows with those objects or by his being hurled against those objects. Those injuries, taken together or separately, caused 'slight' damage to the health ... During the examination and treatment of [the applicant], immediately after the injuries had been caused or in a subsequent period of time, [the investigation] did not establish any data which could have shown that [the applicant] had had a head injury, a rib fracture, a spinal injury or any other injuries of a traumatic character.”\", \"30.  On 1 December 2006 a deputy Bryansk Regional Prosecutor quashed the decision and authorised the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor's office to open an additional investigation into the applicant's complaints.\", \"31.  According to the Government, three days later the Dyatkovo Town Prosecutor closed the investigation, finding no criminal conduct in the police officers' actions. The Government did not produce a copy of the decision of 4 December 2006. However, they submitted that officers S. and P. had been questioned and had confirmed the statements they had made during the previous rounds of the investigation. In particular, the officers had stressed that the use of rubber truncheons had been an adequate and proportionate response to the applicant's unlawful behaviour. The Government further noted that in his decision of 4 December 2006 the prosecutor had relied on the results of the applicant's medical examination of 4 November 2004. The examination had established that the applicant's illnesses had had no causal link to the injuries recorded on 15 December 2002. The prosecution authorities had also questioned four persons who had been detained together with the applicant on 14 and 15 December 2002. According to those individuals, the applicant had not complained about being beaten in the police station.\", \"32.  The Government further noted that the Prosecutor General's office of the Russian Federation had thoroughly studied the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the Dyatkovo Town prosecutor's office between 1 and 4 December 2006, and in the Government's view the investigation had been comprehensive. The applicant's injuries had been “caused as a result of his unlawful actions”. The Prosecutor General's office had conceded that officers S. and P. had not overstepped the boundaries of their professional responsibilities in applying force against the applicant.\", \"33.  On 29 May 2003 the Dyatkovo Town Court found the applicant guilty of robbery and assault and sentenced him to eight years and three months' imprisonment.  On 11 July 2003 the Bryansk Regional Court, on appeal, reduced the sentence by one year.\"], 'applicants': ['ANTIPENKOV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['13', '15', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '25', '29', '34', '36', '61']}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23], 'explained_indices': [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 13, 14, 26, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 15, 27], 'explained_distances': [0.14598642, 0.11510351, 0.10146144, 0.09699187, 0.09140855, 0.07201934, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456, 0.028838456], 'number_of_sentences': 28, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 3 June 1994 at about 4.30 a.m. while the applicant's brother, Savaş Buldan, was leaving the casino at the Çınar Hotel in the Yeşilyurt area of Istanbul, together with his two friends Adnan Yıldırım and Hacı Karay, they were approached by seven or eight people with walkie-talkies, firearms and bullet-proof vests who introduced themselves as police officers. The three men were then forced into three cars.\", '10.  The applicant, who at this time was living in Turkey, was informed of what had happened to his brother at 5 a.m. that same day. With friends and family he began a search, especially along the Istanbul-Ankara motorway. Part of the search party came to an area called the Yedigöller (Seven Lakes). This was a national park. According to the applicant, there was a shooting polygon situated therein, open only to members of the security forces and high-level State officials. The Government on the other hand deny the existence of such a shooting polygon. The search party met a watchman at the national park, who told them that 10 or 11 people in three cars had entered the area on the same day at about 7.30 a.m. The watchman then gave a description of the three vehicles that matched the description given by those who had witnessed the abduction at the Çınar Hotel.', \"11.  When the applicant learnt about the kidnapping of his brother, he immediately contacted members of Parliament, the Governor of Istanbul and the media. The Office of the Prime Minister was also informed about the kidnapping. The applicant and his legal representative made a further written application to the Bakırköy public prosecutor's office. The initial enquiries made by the authorities showed that the three persons had not been taken into custody.\", \"12.  The same day, Mr Nihat Buldan, one of Savaş Buldan's brothers, submitted another petition to the Bakırköy public prosecutor's office in which he claimed that his brother and two of his brother's friends had been abducted by people who had identified themselves as plainclothes police officers. Mr Nihat Buldan requested the prosecutor to investigate the matter. The prosecutor asked the family members to go to the Yeşilköy police headquarters, which was responsible for the area where the incident had taken place. The family members complied with this request but no written statements were taken from them at the police headquarters. The Yeşilköy police headquarters informed the Bakırköy police headquarters and also the anti-terrorist branch of the police about the events on the same day.\", '13.  On 3 June 1994 at about 9 p.m., Mr İsmail Taşcan contacted the Yığılca gendarmerie station within the district of Bolu, some 270 kilometres from where the three men had been abducted. He informed the gendarmes that he had seen three bodies in an area near the river where he had gone to fish. The same day at about 9.15 p.m. the gendarmerie arrived at the scene. During the preliminary search, no empty cartridges or other evidence could be found as it was very dark.', '14.  The public prosecutor and two doctors arrived at the scene of the crime at about 11 p.m. The positions of the bodies were recorded. No documents or other property were found on the bodies which might establish their identities. It was further noted that valuable items such as gold rings and wrist watches were intact. The preliminary investigation of the bodies revealed that rigor mortis had set in and that the three men had been shot at point-blank range. Subsequently, at about 2.45 a.m. on 4 June 1994 the corpses were taken to the Health Centre in Yığılca for further examination.', '15.  On the night of 3 June 1994, the gendarmerie in Bolu contacted the applicant and informed him that three corpses had been found in Yığılca.', '16.  On 4 June 1994 the applicant identified the bodies of his brother and his two friends at the Düzce State Hospital.', '17.  On 4 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the Çınar Hotel. In his statement, Mr Uz explained that when the three persons who had disappeared, all of whom he knew as they were regular customers at the hotel casino, emerged from the hotel door sometime between 4.30 and 5 a.m. on 3 June 1994, six or seven persons, who had arrived in two cars, had approached them and held them against the wall and conducted body searches. The three persons were then put into a dark-coloured Mercedes car with registration number 34 CK 420. The doorman stated that he had overheard one of the men saying that they were police officers and that they would release the three persons as soon as statements had been taken from them. The Mercedes then left followed by the second car which, according to the doorman, was a sports car. The doorman was unable to describe any of the men as it was dark and they had been standing some distance from him.', '18.  Also on 4 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr Hüseyin Kılıç, a security guard at the Çınar Hotel. Mr Kılıç stated that seven or eight men had approached the three disappeared persons as they walked out the door. The men all wore waistcoats and were carrying weapons. They forced the three disappeared persons into the waiting cars, after having conducted body searches. This witness stated that one of the cars was a sports car.', '19.  On 5 June 1994 a statement was taken from Mr Serdar Özdemir, who was a taxi driver waiting at the taxi rank outside the Çınar Hotel. He stated that while waiting for customers, he had noticed three persons coming out of the casino. At that very moment, seven or eight men walked towards them, made the three persons face the wall and then searched them. Afterwards, the three were put into the waiting cars. One of the cars was a black-coloured Mercedes 300 SEL. The second car was a cherry-red Hyundai. The witness also recalled that he had seen a third car, a sports car, which had been driven away by one of the men wearing a waistcoat. The witness had been unable to see the licence plates of the cars or the faces of the seven or eight men.', '20.  Again on 5 June 1994 another statement was taken from another taxi driver, Mr Hüseyin Durmazer. Mr Durmazer stated that as he approached the taxi rank outside the hotel, he was able to see some people putting three other persons into a black car.', '21.  The preliminary enquiries led the Bakırköy public prosecutor to issue a continuous search warrant on 23 June 1994, which was valid for ten years in accordance with the statutory limit stipulated for kidnapping.', \"22.  On 17 March 1995 the Bakırköy public prosecutor's investigation file, together with a report summarising the investigation, was forwarded to the Yığılca public prosecutor in order to authorise him to investigate the killings since the bodies were found within his area of jurisdiction.\", '23.  When the bodies were brought to the Yığılca Health Centre in the early hours of 4 June 1994, post mortem examinations of the bodies were carried out by two doctors in the presence of the Yığılca public prosecutor. In the body examination report, it was noted that there was an ecchymosis measuring 1x1 cm and an abrasion on the surface of the knee cap of the second body that was later identified as that of Savaş Buldan. It was further recorded that cyanosis was noted on the front part of the body, left leg upper part, left knee, genitals and the head. It was also perceived that rigor mortis was fading. It was observed that when the body was touched, the skin peeled - which was most probably due to its damp condition. One bullet entrance hall on right occipital area and burnt hair caused by a close-range shot and a bullet exit hole behind the right ear (which damaged the tissue, internal tissue and bones) were noted. A wide haematoma on the left eye due to trauma caused by a blunt object, fracture of the nose, and blood from the nostrils to the moustache area were also noticed. No other signs or abnormalities were observed either on the back of the body or the genital area. There were no documents to prove identification, nor were there any valuables or money. On the surface of the right hand and wrist a further ecchymosis measuring 1 cm. in width was noted, which was probably caused when the hands were tied with a rope. The doctors further concluded that as the cause of death was clearly cerebral haemorrhage, there was no need to conduct a classical autopsy. The estimated time of death was given as 10 hours before the autopsy was carried out.', '24.  The bullets recovered from the bodies were sent for a ballistics examination to the Central Police Forensic Laboratory. The Central Police Laboratory prepared two forensic reports dated 6 and 14 June 1994. The ballistics report prepared by the Police Forensic Laboratory on 14 June 1994 showed that five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing had been discharged by three different pistols. The report also showed that two bullets recovered from the bodies of Savaş Buldan and Hacı Karay had been fired from the same 9 mm. pistol. The report concluded that comparisons of the five spent bullet cases with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings since 1985 did not reveal any similarities.', '25.  The bullets were then sent to the Gendarmerie Forensic Laboratory which prepared its own report on 17 June 1994. This report showed that the two bullets recovered from the bodies of Savaş Buldan and Hacı Karay, both 9 mm and Parabellum type, had been fired from the same pistol. The report further concluded that comparisons of five spent bullet cases found at the scene of the killing with other bullet cases recovered from the scenes of other unknown perpetrator killings did not reveal any similarities. These ballistics reports, together with the photo fits of suspects, were sent to the Yığılca public prosecutor on 21 June 1994.', '26.  On 4 June 1994 the Yığılca public prosecutor conducted a search of the scene of the crime in the presence of Mr İsmail Taşcan, who had found the bodies. During the examination, a person named Ms Ayşe Araç told the public prosecutor that she had heard a gun shot in the morning of 3 June 1994.', \"27.  On 4 June 1994 the Yığılca gendarmerie took statements from 13 persons who claimed to have seen three luxury cars travelling in the direction of the spot where the bodies were later found. One of these witnesses, Fevzi Aydın, stated that at around 8 a.m. on 3 June 1994 he had been having his breakfast when he had seen three cars. The first car had stopped and one of the persons inside the car had asked him for directions to Bolu. The witness stated that it was a red car, but he was unable to remember the make of the car. There were two persons in the car, both around 40 years of age with one of them sporting a beard. The witness had also seen three persons in the third car. The witness was able to remember that the car registrations all started with '34', the prefix for cars registered in Istanbul. Most of the other witnesses also gave similar statements.\", \"28.  On 6 June 1994 statements were taken from 11 other witnesses including a number of officials working at the Yedigöller National Park. One of these witnesses, Muzaffer Yıldız, confirmed that the cars' licence plates all had the prefix '34'. The witness also stated that one of the passengers had asked for directions to the Yedigöller National Park. Another witness, Şevket Öztürk, similarly stated that he had seen the three cars and that he had also been asked for directions to the Yedigöller National Park by a passenger in a Mercedes with darkened windows.\", '29.  On 7 June 1994 five more witnesses were questioned. These witnesses also stated that they had seen the three cars at 9 or 9.30 a.m. One of them stated that he had been asked for directions to Bolu.', '30.  On 10 June 1994 all the witness statements and other documents were sent to the Yığılca public prosecutor.', '31.  On 21 June 1994 a statement was taken from Nihat Buldan, a brother of Savaş Buldan. He stated that he had been told about the kidnapping which was said to have been carried out by persons claiming to be police officers. This was the reason why he had contacted the police to verify whether his brother had been taken into custody. The witness concluded his statement by stating that his brother had no enemies and that he did not suspect anyone. He requested that the perpetrators responsible for the kidnapping and the subsequent killing be apprehended.', '32.  On 31 August 1995 the Yığılca public prosecutor concluded in a continuous search warrant that it had not been possible to establish the identities of the perpetrators. The prosecutor further stated in this report that no evidence had been found during the investigation. It was decided, therefore, to issue a continuous search warrant for the perpetrators of the killings, which remained valid for twenty years, the statutory time limit under Article 102 of the Turkish Criminal Code. Copies of this search warrant were distributed to the Yığılca gendarmerie and the Yığılca police as well as to the Bakırköy public prosecutor in Istanbul so that they could inform the Yığılca public prosecutor if they found the perpetrators. The prosecutor also instructed these authorities to continue to carry out meticulous searches for the perpetrators.', '33.  On 10 January 1995 the Police Laboratory, which had carried out a forensic examination on a 9-mm Smith and Wesson pistol and 11 bullets found in a car in Istanbul, concluded that this weapon had not been used in any unknown perpetrator murder.', '34.  On 4 June 1996 a statement was taken from Mr İrfan Kurşunlu who had first seen the bodies together with his uncle at 8.15 p.m. on 3 June 1994. He stated that he had not heard any gun shots that day.', '35.  Also on 4 June 1996 the Yığılca public prosecutor visited the spot where the bodies had been found. He also went to take a statement from one Ayşe Araç who claimed that she had heard gun shots on the day of the killing. The house of Ayşe Araç was just outside Hacılar village and approximately two kilometres from the scene of the incident. In order to test whether this would have been possible, the prosecutor ordered a gendarmerie soldier to the incident scene and to fire a weapon similar to the one used in the killings. The prosecutor was able to hear the gun shot. The prosecutor summoned 12 persons who had seen the three cars on the day of the incident to his office in order to take further statements from them.', '36.  On 6 June 1996 a gendarmerie non-commissioned officer visited the spot where the bodies had been found and prepared a report. According to this report, the scene of the incident was exactly 7,000 metres from Yığılca town centre. It was impossible for a person in Hacılar village, which was eight kilometres away, to have heard the gun shots. According to the experiments carried out that day, the maximum distance from which gun shots could have been heard was five kilometres.', \"37.  On 6 June 1996 a statement was taken by the Yığılca public prosecutor from Ayşe Uzun who had seen the three cars on the day of the incident. She stated that one of the cars had been a red Mazda with four persons in it. She had not seen any of the cars' number plates.\", '38.  On 6 June 1996 another statement was taken by the prosecutor from one Bengü Çelebi who had also seen the three cars on the day of the incident. She was able to recall that one of the cars had been a red Mazda. She stated that there were three persons in the last car, which had darkened windows.', \"39.  On 7 June 1996 the Ministry of Justice informed the Düzce public prosecutor about the application made to the former Commission by the applicant. The Ministry's letter stated that there were no documents in the investigation file showing that attempts had been made to trace the cars used in the kidnapping despite the fact that eyewitnesses had given the authorities the full registration number of one of the cars and the prefixes of the other two cars. In addition, some witnesses who lived near the spot where the three persons had been killed had stated that they had heard gun shots and that the timing of the gun shots coincided with the time of the killing. The Ministry's letter finally stated that although it was highly probable that further investigations would not produce any outcome, the investigating authorities should still take further steps in the investigation as this case would be scrutinised by the Commission which, in the past, had put prosecutors in difficulties when questioning them. The Ministry requested that the cars be traced, a check made as to whether witnesses could have heard the gun shots and whether any tyre marks had been subjected to forensic examination. It should also be confirmed with the local gendarmerie whether or not any of the witnesses had informed them on the morning of 3 June 1994 that they had heard gun shots.\", \"40.  In response to the Yeşilköy public prosecutor's office, on 15 November 1996 the Istanbul Security Department stated that the vehicle with registration number 34 CK 420 was a 1984 model, metallic grey Toyota which had belonged to a certain Mr J.H since 16 August 1995.\", '41.  Between 14 July 1998 and 24 August 1999 the area where the three bodies had been found was visited 20 times by the gendarmerie and the police in an attempt to find the perpetrators there. It had not been possible, however, to find the perpetrators or any other evidence at the place.', '42.  After the Susurluk incident of 3 November 1996, the spent cartridges and bullets recovered from the scene were re-examined and compared with the bullets and cartridges of the guns found at the scene of the Susurluk incident by the Gendarmerie Criminal Laboratory. In a report dated 15 January 1997, it was concluded that there was no connection between them.', '43.  On 7 February 1997 Hanefi Avcı, who was the Head of Intelligence Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters at the time, gave a statement to the public prosecutor in connection with the Susurluk incident. In his statement, Mr Avcı referred to the killings of Savaş Buldan, Adnan Yıldırım and Hacı Karay as the work of an illegal group. He further stated that, as that information was based on secret intelligence, he did not have any documents to prove the allegations. He was, however, of the opinion that, if an investigation was carried out into certain sources, it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of these allegations. He was prepared to indicate those issues in respect of which it might be possible to find documents. Among his submissions, which were recorded in a seven-page statement, Mr Avcı stated, inter alia, the following:\\n“The Gendarmerie and the National Intelligence Service (Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı, hereinafter MIT) became concerned about the financial assistance being provided to the PKK from certain members of the Kurdish community, which they felt accounted for its increased activity between 1991 and 1993. They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet Ağar and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Yaşar Öz. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the JİTEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Savaş Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Savaş Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped. To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title”.', '44.  On 24 March 1997 Hanefi Avcı was interrogated once again in Ankara at the request of the Yığılca public prosecutor. In his statement, Mr Avcı stated that he did not know how and by whom the killings were carried out.', '45.  On 11 March 1997 the police officers Ercan Ersoy, Oğuz Yorumaz and Ayhan Çarkın, who were in detention as a result of the investigation into the Susurluk incident, were shown to the eyewitnesses to the abduction, Hüsnü Durmazel and Sabahhattin Uz. However, the eyewitnesses stated that they had not seen these persons before.', '46.  The photo-fit drawings of the three abductors made on the basis of the statements of the witnesses were compared with the photographs of Ercan Ersoy, Oğuz Yorulmaz and Ayhan Çarkın at the Criminal Police Laboratory. In the laboratory report, dated 19 March 1997, it was stated that the photo-fits did not have the necessary facial characteristics to make a positive comparison.', \"47.  On 23 February 1998 the lawyer representing the families of the other two deceased persons lodged a petition with the Yığılca public prosecutor's office. He requested that the photograph of the red car, belonging to Tarık Umit, which was found abandoned after his abduction, be shown to the witnesses heard in Yığılca. When the photograph of the red sports car with registration number 34 ZU 478 was shown to Ali Osman Sivri, Halit Sivri and Fevzi Aydın, who had given statements about the incident in 1994, they all stated that it was not like the car they had seen that day, and that a long time had elapsed since the incident.\", \"48.  The photo-fits were also compared with the photograph of Yaşar Öz, another suspect detained in connection with the Susurluk investigation. The report of the criminal laboratory dated 27 March 1998 concluded that one of the photo-fits bore resemblances to the photograph and that the person in the photo-fit could be Yaşar Öz. Accordingly, on 20 April 1998 the Yığılca Magistrates' Court issued an arrest warrant for Yaşar Öz. At that time, Mr Öz was detained in the Metris prision in Istanbul in connection with another crime. On 5 May 1998 Yaşar Öz gave a statement to the public prosecutor. He stated that he had not been in Istanbul between 1 April 1994 and October 1994 and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on 3 June 1994. He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping. Mr Öz explained that this fact could be easily verified because he had given an interview to a local television channel in Milas at around the time of the kidnapping. On 7 May 1998 Yaşar Öz was formally arrested by the Bakırköy Magistrates' Court.\", \"49.  On 14 May 1998 the Yığılca Criminal Court rejected the appeal of Yaşar Öz against the decision ordering his arrest for the kidnapping and killing of the applicant's brother and the other two persons. On 29 May 1998 an identity parade was held in the prison where Yaşar Öz was being detained on remand. Both Mr Sebahattin Uz, the doorman at the Çınar Hotel, and Mr Hüsnü Durmazer, the taxi driver who had witnessed the kidnapping on 3 June 1994, stated that Yaşar Öz, who was included in a line-up of ten persons, was not one of the men who had carried out the kidnapping. On 14 July 1998 Ali Osman Sivri was questioned by the public prosecutor. Mr Sivri was a watchman working at the Karadere Forest, which was on the road to the Yedigöller National Park. He referred to his previous statement which he had given on 7 June 1994 and stated that he had only seen a red car stop outside his office in the forest at around 10.30 a.m. on 3 June 1994. One person got out of the car and filled a container with water from a fountain and left. This witness was unable to recognise the red sports car with registration number 34 ZU 478. He was also shown pictures of Yaşar Öz. The witness stated that the person he had seen did not look like Yaşar Öz.\", \"50.  On 24 July 1998 the Yığılca public prosecutor took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Yaşar Öz. The prosecutor sent the investigation file to the Ankara State Security Court which, in the prosecutor's opinion, was the competent court to prosecute Mr Öz.\", '51.  On 7 October 1998 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security took a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of Yaşar Öz. The prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the killings had been carried out by or on behalf of an illegal organisation. He therefore concluded that the State Security Court did not have jurisdiction in this matter. The file was sent to the Düzce public prosecutor, who later transferred the file to the Yığılca public prosecutor.', '52.  On 2 November 1998 the Yığılca public prosecutor, noting that Yaşar Öz had been arrested and put on trial for the killings, decided to continue the search for the other perpetrators. The prosecutor also asked the Düzce public prosecutor to charge Yaşar Öz, who, according to the evidence gathered by the Yığılca public prosecutor, was one of the perpetrators of the kidnappings and subsequent killings.', \"53.  On 16 November 1998 the Düzce public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Düzce Assize Court. The prosecutor alleged that the evidence justified the prosecution of Yaşar Öz for the murder of the applicant's brother and his two friends.\", \"54.  During the proceedings before the Düzca Assize Court, the court took into consideration the indictment which had been submitted to the Istanbul State Security Court on 29 April 1997 and which dealt with Yaşar Öz's role in the Susurluk affair. The Düzce Assize Court noted that, according to this indictment, Yaşar Öz was a notorious international drugs trafficker who held three official service passports, two of which were in the names of Tarık Ümit and Eşref Çuğdar.\", \"55.  The Düzce Assize Court finally noted that Yaşar Öz's name had been implicated in the Susurluk Report which had concluded that the fight against terrorism had gained momentum in 1993 when Mehmet Ağar was appointed head of the General Police Headquarters in Ankara. According to this Report, there had been a number of unknown perpetrator murders in the area between Izmit, Adapazarı and Bolu after the then prime minister declared publicly that she had in her possession a list containing the names of those businessmen who were supporting the PKK. The Report further stated that the killings of Savaş Buldan, Behçet Cantürk, Vedat Aydın, Medet Serhat Yöş and Metin Can formed part of such activities.\", '56.  Recalling that Savaş Buldan, Adnan Yıldırım and Hacı Karay had been kidnapped by seven persons and then killed in the area between Izmit, Adapazarı and Bolu, the Düzce Assize Court held that these killings resembled the above-mentioned killings in the same area. Considering that the defendant was already facing prosecution before another court for membership of an organisation which was allegedly responsible for killing persons who had much in common with the deceased persons in the present case and as there was no other evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out for personal reasons, the Düzce Assize Court concluded on 24 November 1998 that it was precluded from examining the merits of the case for reasons of jurisdiction.', \"57.  The case file was transferred to the Ankara State Security Court which had jurisdiction to deal with cases involving organised crime. On 16 December 1998 the Ankara State Security Court concluded that it too did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case. The court held that according to the Düzce public prosecutor's indictment of 16 November 1998, Yaşar Öz was charged with multiple murders. The indictment had made no reference to organised crime and the court did not have jurisdiction to examine this allegation ex officio. The case file was sent to the Court of Cassation in order to resolve the dispute over jurisdiction.\", '58.  On 25 February 1999 the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, upholding the decision of the Ankara State Security Court, ruled that the Düzce Assize Court had jurisdiction to deal with the case.', \"59.  Seven hearings were held before the Düzce Assize Court in the course of the criminal proceedings against Yaşar Öz. Nihat Buldan, one of Savaş Buldan's brothers, joined the proceedings as a civil party. Yaşar Öz told the court that there was no evidence to link him to the killings and that the only reason for putting him on trial was to prove to the European courts that the killings were being investigated. 19 eyewitnesses, who had either seen the three men being put into the cars outside the hotel in Istanbul or had seen the three cars near the spot where these persons were killed, stated during the hearings that they had never seen Yaşar Öz before.\", \"60.  On 18 November 1999 the Düzce Assize Court acquitted Yaşar Öz of the charge of multiple murders due to lack of evidence. The case file was sent back to the Yığılca public prosecutor's office to continue the search for the perpetrators.\", \"61.

The applicant produced several press releases concerning the abduction and killing of his brother.', \"63.  The applicant further submitted to the Court a copy of the so-called “Susurluk Report”, which was produced at the request of the Prime Minister by Mr Kutlu Savas, Vice-President of the Board of Inspectors within the Prime Minister's Office. After receiving the report in January 1998, the Prime Minister made it available to the public, although eleven pages and certain annexes were withheld.\", '64.  The introduction states that the Report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigation report. It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events which had occurred mainly in south-east Turkey and which tended to confirm the existence of unlawful dealings between political figures, government institutions and clandestine groups.', \"65.  The Report analyses a series of events, such as murders carried out under orders, the killings of well-known figures or supporters of the Kurds and deliberate acts by a group of “informants” supposedly serving the State, and concludes that there was a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that formed as a result, particularly in the drug-trafficking sphere. In the Report, reference is made to the killing of the applicant's brother:\\n“All the relevant State bodies were aware of these activities and operations. ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined, the difference between those Kurdish supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter represented in economic terms. These factors also operated in the murder of Savaş Buldan, a smuggler and pro-PKK activist. (page 74).”\", '66.  The Report concludes with numerous recommendations, such as improving co-ordination and communication between the different branches of the security, police and intelligence departments; identifying and dismissing security force personnel implicated in illegal activities; limiting the use of “confessors”; reducing the number of village guards; terminating the use of the Special Operations Bureau outside the south-east region and incorporating it into the police force outside that area; opening investigations into various incidents; taking steps to suppress gang and drug-smuggling activities; and recommending that the results of the Grand National Assembly Susurluk inquiry be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for the relevant proceedings to be undertaken.'], 'applicants': ['BULDAN'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['14', '13', '3', '2'], 'violated_articles': ['2', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['43', '54', '55', '56'], '13': ['85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90']}, 'silver_rationales': [34, 45, 46, 47], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [34, 45, 46, 47], 'explained_indices': [28, 22, 27, 56, 29, 34, 35, 21, 36, 42, 43, 48, 49, 50, 55, 41, 20, 57, 18, 38, 39, 40, 7, 6, 5, 44, 45, 46, 47, 4, 51, 52, 53, 54, 17, 8, 37, 10, 19, 16, 15, 14, 23, 9, 25, 24, 13, 12, 11, 30, 31, 32, 33, 26, 3, 2, 0, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915804, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018915781, 0.0018011457, -0.005970099, -0.052306857, -0.100958064], 'number_of_sentences': 58, 'article_id': 3, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Maribor.', '6.  On the night of 13 April 1990 the applicant, then eighteen years old, was raped by a group of seven males. Three other males allegedly participated: one as an aider and abettor and two others by committing a sexual assault on her. Five of the accused had not yet reached the age of majority (eighteen years) at the time of the commission of the criminal acts and were accordingly tried as juveniles.', '7.  In September 1990 criminal charges of rape, aiding and abetting rape and sexual assault were brought against the accused. All of them submitted in their defence that the applicant had voluntarily engaged in sexual activity with them.', '8.  The court held a number of hearings and obtained expert reports. An expert in clinical psychology found that the applicant had a learning disability and that she had not been physically or mentally capable of offering serious resistance.', '9.  On 13 November 1990 the Maribor Basic Court rendered a judgment acquitting the defendants of all charges. The verdict was based on the findings that the applicant had not seriously resisted sexual intercourse, that she had changed her testimony regarding the events surrounding one of the rape charges during the proceedings and that the defendants could not be considered to have employed force or threats which would be objectively capable of breaking the victim’s resistance.', '10.  The Public Prosecutor appealed against the judgment.', '11.  On 10 April 1991 the Maribor Higher Court quashed the first-instance judgment, finding that the facts had been insufficiently established. It ordered that the case be remitted to the first-instance court for fresh consideration before a different panel, without the participation of the judges who had delivered the impugned judgment.', '12.  In July 1991 the Maribor Basic Court conducted inquiries in order to establish the place of residence of two of the defendants. However, as the two defendants had allegedly emigrated to Austria, they could not be found. Several more inquiries were made in 1995, 1999, 2000 and 2001, but all attempts at establishing these two defendants’ whereabouts proved unsuccessful.', '13.  Between 10 March 1995 and 31 August 2000 the applicant sent at least eight letters urging the Maribor District Court (previously called the Maribor Basic Court) to accelerate the proceedings and/or asking for a case review by the president of the court owing to delays in scheduling the first retrial hearing.', '14.  In the period from 20 May 1999 to 25 September 2001 the court scheduled five hearings, all of which were, however, adjourned for failure of some of the defendants to appear.', '15.  On 5 January 2001 the Director of the Department for Judicial Administration at the Ministry of Justice informed the applicant that the court had encountered difficulties identifying some of the defendants’ residences. He also noted that between 28 May 1990 and 27 September 2000 there had been frequent changes of the presiding judge in her case due to judges being promoted. He mentioned that in the aforementioned period seven different judges had been dealing with the case.', '16.  Following this information, on 9 March 2001 the applicant suggested that the charges against the two defendants, one charged with rape and the other with aiding and abetting rape, who were allegedly residing in Austria and could not be found, be severed into a separate case and an international arrest warrant be issued against them.', '17.  On 29 May 2001 the Maribor District Court issued a detention order against the two defendants, which served as a legal basis for the issuing of the international arrest warrant.', '18.  On 22 November 2001 the court held the first hearing, followed by four more. It also obtained reports from two experts, one in neuropsychiatry and the other in clinical psychology.', '19.  On 4 June 2002 the court found one defendant guilty of rape under the first paragraph of Article 180 of the Penal Code and five defendants guilty of aggravated rape under the second paragraph of Article 180 of the Criminal Code. Regardless of the fact that they were tried as juveniles, the rules of sentencing applicable to adults applied to them as they had all reached the age of twenty-one before the judgment was given. The defendants were sentenced to prison sentences ranging from eight months to one year on account of, inter alia, the significant passage of time from the commission of the crime until their conviction. However, the court concluded that prison sentences were appropriate in order to make the defendants realise the gravity of their offences, particularly as they had not shown any genuine regret over the criminal acts committed against the applicant who continued to suffer from the consequences thereof. Lastly, the court acquitted the two defendants who had been charged with sexual assault.', '20.  The convicted defendants appealed; however, their appeals were dismissed by the Maribor Higher Court on 25 January 2006. Their subsequent extraordinary appeals (requests for the protection of legality) were also dismissed by the Supreme Court on 12 July 2007.', '21.  The defendant charged with aiding and abetting the rape of the applicant, whose whereabouts had been unknown and whose case had been separated from the main proceedings, was extradited to Slovenia on 9 March 2004. On 30 March 2004 the court held a hearing and found the defendant guilty. He was sentenced to eight months in prison. The defendant’s subsequent appeal was dismissed on 4 August 2004.', '22.  The other missing defendant was arrested in Slovakia and detained on 21 February 2003. After having been extradited to Slovenia, the court held hearings on 4 and 5 September 2003 and on the latter date convicted him of aggravated rape under the second paragraph of Article 180 of the Penal Code. He, too, was sentenced to eight months in prison. He appealed against the verdict; however, on 9 June 2006 his appeal was dismissed by the Maribor Higher Court.', '23.  On 22 September 1995 the applicant lodged a civil claim against all ten defendants and a number of the defendants’ parents, seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage she had sustained as a result of the rape.', '24.  On 17 June 2002 the civil panel of the Maribor District Court stayed the civil proceedings pending a final decision in the criminal proceedings. The civil trial was resumed in November 2007.', '25.  Subsequently, two hearings were held and on 21 January 2009 the first instance court gave a judgment awarding the applicant 16,691.70 euros (EUR), together with default interest. The applicant and some of the respondent parties appealed. On 10 March 2010 the Maribor Higher Court upheld the applicant’s appeal and dismissed the respondents’ appeal. In the civil retrial, the District Court found that the two respondents who had initially been excluded from liability for damages owing to their acquittal in the criminal proceedings were jointly liable for the damages awarded to the applicant.', '26.  One of the two respondents appealed against the judgment, but on 9 November 2011 the Maribor Higher Court dismissed his appeal.', '27.  Following unsuccessful settlement negotiations with the State Attorney’s Office, on 30 November 2009 the applicant lodged a claim with the Celje Local Court seeking compensation in the amount of EUR 5,000, the maximum amount that could be awarded for non-pecuniary damage incurred as a result of the length of the criminal proceedings. She relied on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without Undue Delay Act (hereinafter “the 2006 Act”). She submitted that her interest in the criminal proceedings had not only been of a pecuniary nature but also aimed at safeguarding her rights under Article 3 of the Convention.', '28.  On 16 November 2010 the court rendered a judgment, finding that the applicant’s right to trial within a reasonable time had been breached and that the State was to pay EUR 5,000 to the applicant, together with default interest. The court pointed out that the overall duration of the proceedings had amounted to fifteen years and nine months, noting in particular the lack of any activity between April 1991 and March 2001. Moreover, it observed that the applicant’s case had involved two major criminal acts, a gang rape and a sexual assault, which, in addition to posing a considerable threat to society, had caused severe mental distress to the applicant. The court emphasised that due to the nature of these criminal acts committed against her, the criminal proceedings ought to have been conducted in a particularly diligent, determined and prompt manner; however, that had not been the case. It was further noted that the lengthy proceedings had been extremely stressful for the applicant, who had been forced to relive the painful events too many times, in addition to which she had had no effective remedies at her disposal in order to accelerate the proceedings. Thus, having regard to the importance of the case for the applicant and the lengthy period of absence of any procedural acts on the part of the criminal court, the court deviated from the general practice of the domestic authorities to award, within the statutory range of between EUR 300 and 5,000, 45% of the sum that would be awarded for a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time by the Court. Thus, the applicant was awarded the maximum amount possible under the 2006 Act, although she would have apparently not been entitled to such amount purely on the basis of the excessive length of proceedings.', '29.  The applicant and the State Attorney lodged appeals. On 4 August 2011 the Celje Higher Court modified the first-instance judgment in so far as it concerned the costs of proceedings. It rejected the remainder of the appeals.', '30.  On 13 October 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal and initiative petition for the review of the constitutionality of the 2006 Act in so far as it limited the maximum amount to be awarded for a violation of the “reasonable time” requirement to EUR 5,000. She alleged that the statutory limitation of compensation in this manner was unconstitutional, as the maximum amount did not constitute sufficient redress for particularly arduous cases such as her own.', '31.  On 10 February 2012 the Constitutional Court rejected the constitutional appeal as inadmissible. Consequently, the applicant’s petition for the review of the constitutionality of the 2006 Act’s limitation on compensation was also rejected, as the court held that the possible annulment of the challenged statutory provision could not have had any legal effects on the applicant’s position.'], 'applicants': ['W.'], 'defendants': ['SLOVENIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['11', '12', '14', '19', '20', '21', '22', '30', '31', '35', '51', '64', '7', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26], 'explained_indices': [8, 5, 0, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 25, 26, 2, 3, 7, 1, 6, 4], 'explained_distances': [0.14311919, 0.12511075, 0.047927827, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.040667772, 0.032217324, 0.01444459, -0.01857403, -0.022840232, -0.10352278, -0.105885506], 'number_of_sentences': 27, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Moscow.', '7.  On 29 June 2001 the applicant and his school friend Mr N. were spending the evening together. At about 11.30 p.m. they went to Mr N.’s place as Mr N., who is a diabetic, needed an insulin injection. After that they took a taxi to the applicant’s place.', '8.  While walking through the courtyard they were assaulted, near house no. 16/18 on Shcherbakovskaya Street in the Eastern Administrative District of Moscow. The attacker called out to them from behind and, before they could turn round, they received strong blows to their heads, fainted and collapsed on the ground. A considerable sum of money, a gold bracelet and a cell phone were stolen from them.', '9.  Neighbours called the Sokolinaya Gora police station. At 1.40 a.m. on 30 June 2001 the police officers Mr Zharov and Mr Volkov arrived at the scene. They served in the 2nd police battalion of the Eastern Administrative District of Moscow, whose main task was to provide security to businesses and private property under commercial contracts. In addition to that, they acted as neighbourhood patrol officers.', '10.  According to their statements, they saw two young men on the road whom they believed to be drunk. One of them was sitting, the other lay still. Some vomit could be seen. The policemen claimed that they reported the situation to the officer at the Sokolinaya Gora police station and told him that an ambulance or specialists from a sobering-up centre should be called.', '11.  The policemen then dragged the unconscious applicant and his friend away from the road into the courtyard of house no. 16/18. According to the Government, the policemen left the applicant and N. “on a grass plot”; the applicant claimed that they had been put “in the rubbish dump”. At that moment the private security co-ordinator (дежурный по отделу вневедомственной охраны) informed the officers that an alarm had gone off and instructed them to check it out. They reported it to the officer at the police station and left the scene.', '12.  At about 7 a.m. janitors Ms E. and Mr B. spotted two young men some three or four metres away from the rubbish bins and attempted to wake them up. However, both were unconscious, the dark-haired one (Mr N.) mumbled incoherently. They called for an ambulance.', '13.  At 8 a.m. Doctor P. arrived in the first ambulance. On seeing two victims, he called for another ambulance and began attending to Mr N. who had an abrasion and haematoma on his left cheek. When Mr N. regained consciousness, Doctor P. helped him climb into the van and took him to Moscow City Hospital no. 1.', '14.  In the meantime, a second ambulance arrived with Doctor Ch. He loaded the still unconscious applicant into the van and took him to Moscow City Hospital no. 33.', '15.  Upon arrival at the hospital at 9.05 a.m. the applicant was diagnosed with alcohol intoxication. Injuries and abrasions on his wrists and forehead were noted. Two hours later he was examined by a neurosurgeon.', '16.  Until 5 p.m. on 1 July 2001 the applicant remained, still unconscious and also undressed, on a trolley in the hospital corridor.', '17.  At 6.30 p.m. emergency surgery – bilateral trepanation of the skull – was performed on him.', '18.  On 8 July 2001 the applicant’s mother invited a private doctor to examine her son. The doctor determined that the applicant was in a life-threatening condition. An ambulance transferred the applicant in a state of coma to the Burdenko Military Hospital in Moscow.', '19.  From 9 July to 27 July 2001 the applicant was in a coma. On 25 July 2001 tracheotomy (creation of a surgical airway in the cervical trachea) was performed and a cannula was inserted.', '20.  After he woke up from the coma, he was transferred to the neurosurgery unit where he stayed in a critical state until 10 August.', '21.  Until the removal of the cannula in October 2001 and then in December 2002, the applicant underwent several operative procedures for osteomyelitis of the skull.', '22.  On 1 October 2001 a medical panel recognised the applicant as having disability of the second category.', '23.  In 2002 the applicant developed post-traumatic convulsive disorder. On 13 June 2003 he had a seizure and fainted. He was taken to Burdenko Hospital and operated upon for a pus abscess in the skull.', '24.  On 30 June and 1 July 2001 the Sokolinaya Gora police station received from Hospitals nos. 1 and 33 reports on bodily injuries concerning the applicant and Mr N. The head of the inquiries section of the police station asked the operational officer Mr Yermakov to check the reports. Subsequently the internal inquiry (see below) revealed that Mr Yermakov had not taken any measures for the purpose of inspecting the crime scene, identifying witnesses or interviewing the victims.', '25.  On 6 July 2001 Mr Yermakov forwarded the materials to the Investigations Department where the case was assigned to the operational officer Mr Abdryayev. Mr Abdryayev did not take any procedural decision regarding the materials until 17 July 2001.', '26.  On 18 July 2001 the head of the Sokolinaya Gora police station launched an internal inquiry which revealed that nothing had been done with regard to the injury reports. Both Mr Yermakov and Mr Abdryayev were disciplined. On the same day the crime scene was examined for the first time. On 20 July 2001 a criminal investigation into the assault on the applicant and Mr N. was opened.', '27.  On 20 September 2001 the investigator Mr Drozdov issued a decision to discontinue the proceedings because the perpetrator of the assault could not be identified. The only items of evidence referred to in the decision were statements by the police officers Volkov and Zharov, by the ambulance doctor and by Mr N.', '28.  On 16 October 2001 the investigator Mr Solomkin decided to re-open the investigation.', '29.  By letter of 29 October 2001, a deputy to the Presidential Envoy in the Central Federal Region wrote to the applicant’s mother that her complaint about the prolonged investigation had been examined by the Internal Security Department of the Ministry of the Interior. It had been established that the inquiry had not been properly conducted, that no one had visited or examined the crime scene, and that no other investigative steps had been taken. Operational police officers Mr Yermakov and Mr Abramov had been reprimanded.', '30.  On 16 November 2001, 6 January, 19 April, 13 June and 15 August 2002, decisions to suspend the proceedings were issued because the perpetrator(s) could not be identified. Supervising prosecutors set these decisions aside and instructed the investigator to take additional investigative measures, such as interviewing caretakers in the neighbouring buildings and the night watchman in the Korona café and examining the list of calls made from the stolen cell phone.', '31.  On 12 September 2003 the case was transferred to the Main Investigations Department of the Moscow City Police.', '32.  In a letter of 27 February 2004 the Investigations Committee of the Ministry of the Interior acknowledged that the investigation of cases nos. 073041 and 1056 (see below) had been improper, noting as follows:\\n“Thus, it has been established that at the initial stage the investigation of case no. 73041 was carried out at a low professional level and in breach of the rules of criminal procedure. On many occasions proceedings were prematurely suspended on the ground that the persons responsible could not be identified. Certain officers of the Sokolinaya Gora police station of the Eastern Administrative District in Moscow were disciplined for violations of the rules of criminal procedure and inadequate management of the investigation. Investigation of case no. 1056 [medical negligence] was also held back because of significant failures.\\nHaving regard to deficiencies in the investigation and in compliance with the directions of the Moscow city prosecutor’s office, additional investigative steps and operational measures are now being carried out in the above cases with a view to examining the events in a comprehensive and thorough fashion and establishing the criminal liability of those responsible.”', '33.  On 2 April and 13 May 2004 public prosecutors reversed further police decisions suspending the investigation and ordered that specific investigative measures be taken.', '34.  On 4 June 2004 the case was referred to the Eastern Administrative District prosecutor’s office and assigned to the investigator Mr Volk, who was in charge of particularly important cases. On 20 July 2004, 30 January, 18 August and 5 October 2005, and 27 March 2006 Mr Volk suspended the investigation on the ground that the perpetrator(s) of the assault could not be identified. Those decisions were reversed by supervising prosecutors.', '35.  The most recent decision by Mr Volk on suspending the investigation which has been made available to the Court is dated 17 July 2006. It took stock of the evidence that had been collected in the case.', '36.  The decisions indicated that the statements had been taken from both victims – the applicant and N. – who had not remembered the attacker, their friends who had not seen the attack, and also the police officers, janitors and doctors who had seen the victims after the attack. The forensic experts had established that the applicant had sustained “serious bodily injuries” and N. “light bodily injuries”.', '37.  The applicant’s mother told the investigator that shortly after the crime she had visited the Sokolinaya Gora police station. One of the police officers who had curly hair and the nickname “Pushkin”, had described to her that the victims had been found near the Korona café. The applicant’s mother had gone to the café and talked to the employees who had told her that on the night of 29 to 30 July 2001 three police officers nicknamed “Sasha”, “Sidor”, and “Kostya” had been heavily drinking in the café and had been aggressive to the point of seeking a fight with the bartender. However, they had not witnessed any fights between the officers and her son or Mr N. The investigator also took testimony from seven officers from the Sokolinaya Gora police station who claimed they were unable to remember visiting the café on that particular night and did not know anyone nicknamed “Sidor” or “Pushkin”. Three of them denied that they had ever been to the Korona café and the other four acknowledged that they had gone there from time to time.', '38.  Mr N.’s mother stated to the investigator that in the hospital her half-conscious son had mumbled incoherently about “cops” hitting him on the head. When she came to visit him two days later, she stumbled upon two men in civilian clothing by her son’s bed, one of them was shaking her son and asking him whether he had remembered the “cops” who had beaten him. She loudly protested and they all went out into the corridor where the men produced their badges and introduced themselves as the police officers from the Sokolinaya Gora police station, Mr Drozhzhin and Mr Konovalenko. Between themselves, they called each other “Pushkin” and “Dimon”. They told her that they were investigating the assault on her son. The investigator interviewed Mr Drozhzhin, who denied that he had ever visited Mr N. in hospital. Mr Konovalenko was not available for questioning.', '39.  The investigator found that it was impossible to identify the persons responsible for the assault. On 30 November 2006 a supervising prosecutor annulled that decision and instructed Mr Volk to elucidate discrepancies in the testimony by organising confrontations and to locate and examine former police officers from the Sokolinaya Gora police station.', '40.  On 6 January 2002, following on the applicant’s mother’s complaint about an improper performance of their duties by the police officers Mr Zharov and Mr Volkov and by Doctor K., who had not rendered assistance to the applicant that was appropriate for his condition, certain material was severed from the main criminal case for a separate inquiry.', '41.  On 13 March 2002 an investigator with the Izmaylovskiy District prosecutor’s office, on the basis of statements by Mr N., the applicant’s mother, Doctors P., Ch. and K., and the officers Zharov and Volkov, decided that there was no indication of a criminal act because Doctor K. had correctly diagnosed the applicant and had taken all the required measures, and because the officers had “erred in good faith as to Mr Vasilyev’s and Mr N.’s capacity to take care of themselves”.', '42.  On 15 March 2002 a supervising prosecutor quashed that decision. She found that the conclusion about the police officers’ good-faith error contradicted the facts of the case, as the applicant had been unconscious when they had arrived. She decided on the institution of criminal proceedings under Article 293 § 2 of the Criminal Code (criminal negligence leading to the victim’s death or grave injury). The investigation was assigned to the Izmaylovskiy District prosecutor.', '43.  On 15 June and 26 July 2002 the investigation was discontinued for a lack of indications of a criminal offence. These decisions were set aside by higher-ranking prosecutors.', '44.  On an unspecified date the officers Zharov and Volkov were formally charged with abandonment of the applicant and N. in danger, an offence under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.', '45.  On 5 September 2002 the applicant was granted the status of a victim in the proceedings.', '46.  On 27 November 2002 the applicant asked the investigator to amend the legal characterisation of the officers’ actions. He pointed out that the officers had been on duty and had acted in breach of requirements of the Police Act. For that reason they should have been charged with criminal negligence leading to grave consequences, an offence under Article 293 § 2 of the Criminal Code. On the same date the applicant asked the investigator to recognise his status as a civil party. His application bore a handwritten acknowledgement of receipt by the investigator, dated 28 November 2002. It is not clear what response the investigator gave to the applicant’s requests.', '47.  On 29 November 2002 the bill of indictment was served on Mr Volkov and Mr Zharov. The prosecution’s case under Article 125 of the Criminal Code was that they had been the patrolling police officers on duty when they had arrived at the scene and found two unconscious men. Being aware that the men had been helpless and unable to care for themselves, Volkov and Zharov had not fulfilled their legal duty, under the Police Act, the Regulation on Police Patrols and the internal instructions, to protect victims of offences or accidents, intoxicated persons unable to move, and other vulnerable individuals. Even though they had a realistic possibility of providing assistance, they had failed to examine or identify the victims, call an ambulance, administer first aid or take them to a hospital, locate witnesses or secure the crime scene. Instead, they had moved the victims to the side and had falsely reported to the officer at the Sokolinaya Gora police station that all the required measures had been taken.', '48.  On 24 January 2003 the Izmaylovskiy District Court of Moscow scheduled the opening of the trial for 7 February 2003. The judge allegedly told the applicant that his request to join the proceedings as a civil party would be examined at a later stage.', '49.  Hearings were held on 20 February, 25 March, 30 April, 23 June, 28 July and 24 September 2003.', '50.  The trial court took testimony from a neighbourhood resident, the janitors Ms E. and Mr B., ambulance doctors P. and Ch., who described the circumstances in which they had discovered the applicant and Mr N. The senior operational officer Mr K., who had been on duty at the Sokolinaya Gora police station on the night of 29 to 30 June 2001, stated that no telephone call concerning two young men on the Shcherbakovskaya Street had been recorded in the log. However, he had been replaced for one hour by the officer Mr Vancharin. He also testified that the police officers serving in the private-security department (отдел вневедомственной охраны) had to give priority to the orders of the security co-ordinator rather than the orders of the officer-on-duty at the police station.', '51.  The officer Mr Vancharin confirmed that he had taken a call concerning the young men but had not recorded it in the log because it had not been placed through the emergency line. He had radioed to the patrol officers from the private-security department and told them to verify the information. They reported back that they had found two drunk men and that the situation was under control. In response, he instructed them to continue patrolling. The security co-ordinator testified to the court that at 1.44 a.m. he had received an alarm signal and had dispatched the officers Volkov and Zharov to check it out.', '52.  On 29 September 2003 the District Court acquitted both police officers, having made the following assessment of the evidence:\\n“...[T]he court considers that it has not been shown that the defendants Volkov and Zharov acted in the knowledge of the fact that [the applicant and his friend] were in a state that was dangerous for their life and health because they could not know it, as they only spent a few minutes on the scene in the night time and as no injuries were visible. They decided that [the applicant and his friend] were in a state of alcohol or drug intoxication...\\nIn support of their claim that Mr Volkov and Mr Zharov made a false report [to the officer-on-duty] the prosecution referred only to the testimony by the witness Mr Vancharin, who was a police officer but who was not authorised to take any reports. However, he was replacing the officer-on-duty, in breach of the regulations of the Sokolinaya Gora police station...\\nUpon receipt of such information, an officer-on-duty has an obligation to record it in the registration log, to check it and to record the results of the check. The court considers that the officer-on-duty, upon receiving information from Volkov and Zharov that the situation was under control, was required to verify it and obtain credible information about the situation. Mr Vancharin, however, did not do that and did not relay that information or the results of the check to the actual officer-on-duty... The court therefore lends credence to the testimony by Mr Volkov and Mr Zharov... because in these circumstances Mr Vancharin had no interest in telling the truth.”', '53.  On 17 February 2004 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal in a summary fashion.', '54.  On 14 August 2001 the chief medical officer of the emergency care unit informed the applicant’s mother that an internal inquiry had established that the ambulance doctor had diagnosed the applicant on the basis of his friend’s statements. As a result, he had underestimated the gravity of his condition. The doctor had been severely disciplined.', '55.  On 8 November 2001 and 8 February and 2 August 2002 the public prosecutors at various levels informed the applicant’s mother that the doctors of Hospital no. 33 had committed no prosecutable offence and refused to institute criminal proceedings.', '56.  By letter of 4 January 2002, the deputy head of the Moscow Health Protection Committee confirmed that a review of the medical care administered to the applicant at Hospital no. 33 had not identified any defects or shortcomings.', '57.  Further to a complaint by the applicant’s mother, on 5 March 2003 the first deputy to the Moscow City prosecutor cancelled the decision of 2 August 2002, by which the institution of criminal proceedings had been refused, and instructed the Preobrazhenskiy District prosecutor to open a criminal investigation into the offence under Article 124 § 2 of the Criminal Code (failure to render medical assistance to a patient resulting in grave damage to his health).', '58.  On 15 June 2003 a composite medical study was commissioned for the purpose of determining whether the applicant’s health could have been harmed by belated and inadequate medical treatment at Hospital no. 33.', '59.  On 7 July 2003 a panel of six experts from the 111th Centre for Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Defence began their work.', '60.  On 4 September 2003 the investigator Mr Kirichevskiy suspended proceedings because the person responsible could not be identified.', '61.  On 1 December 2003 the experts’ panel returned their findings based on the applicant’s medical record (no. 23304) from Hospital no. 33, materials of the criminal case and information from attending physicians. The experts found, in particular, that an incomplete and contradictory description of the applicant’s injuries upon his arrival at Hospital no. 33 made it impossible to determine the exact origin, time and cause of his injuries. It could only be established that he had been hit on the head with a heavy blunt object. Moreover, a subsequent examination at Burdenko Hospital revealed two broken thoracic vertebrae which had gone unnoticed at Hospital no. 33, where an X-ray examination had been indicated but never carried out.', '62.  The experts determined that, given the grave condition in which the applicant had been admitted, he should have been examined immediately by a neurosurgeon and other specialists for differential diagnosis of craniocerebral injury and intoxication and for decisions on urgent treatment. However, a neurosurgeon examined the applicant more than two hours later upon his arrival and in the following thirty-two hours no specialists saw him and no medical tests, not even the basic blood and urine tests, were carried out. Even the applicant’s temperature was not taken. The experts determined as follows:\\n“From the moment of arrival (at 9.05 a.m. on 30 June 2001) and until the beginning of preparation for surgery (at 5.30 p.m. on 1 July 2001) the [applicant] was not adequately and objectively examined, the real clinical diagnosis was not made... and appropriate medical treatment was not indicated... Prolonged passive observation of the [applicant] not accompanied by clinical examination led to drastic deterioration of his condition and, as a consequence, to belated surgical intervention not based on clinical and lab tests which resulted in markedly negative post-traumatic and post-surgery complications for the [applicant]...\\nIn the post-surgery period antibacterial treatment was indicated but given inconsistently and without appropriate supervision which, most likely, pre-determined subsequent development of suppurative inflammation of post-operative wounds, arachnoid membranes and medullary substances, osteomyelitis of the right parietal bone, etc...”', '63.  The experts also noted that there had been no objective basis for diagnosing the applicant with alcohol intoxication. Neither the ambulance doctor in his notes nor his colleagues in subsequent entries in the medical record mentioned alcohol breath. A reference to alcohol breath appeared for the first time in the partly illegible and incomplete report of a medical examination of 30 June 2001. However, that examination was carried out in breach of the applicable regulations. No treatment for intoxication was indicated and the intoxication diagnosis did not feature in any other documents. The credibility of the intoxication diagnosis was further undermined by the fact that the amount of alcohol allegedly found in the applicant’s blood would have been lethal.', '64.  The experts concluded as follows:\\n“The extent of damage resulting from the [applicant’s] prolonged stay in a medical institution without adequate medical assistance cannot be fully ascertained. It can only be asserted that his condition gravely deteriorated during that period and that irreversible brain changes progressed to the point where emergency surgery was required by life-saving indications...\\nThe present study identified a number of defects in the medical care dispensed to [the applicant] at Hospital no. 33 of Moscow – in particular, unjustified conservative treatment, incomplete examination, belated and incomplete diagnosis, belated surgical intervention, inadequate medical measures – which failed to arrest development of the grave post-traumatic process and contributed to an unfavourable outcome and the [applicant’s] disability. However, it is not possible to measure the extent to which these defects affected the outcome because appropriate measurement methods do not exist.”', '65.  At some point in 2003 it transpired that the applicant’s medical record from Hospital no. 33 was lost. It had been removed by the investigator Mr Solomkin from the hospital in 2001 and produced to the experts for examination. It was then returned to the investigators, who were no longer able to locate it.', '66.  On 12 January 2004 a deputy Moscow City prosecutor reversed the decision suspending the proceedings and asked that those responsible for delays and procedural violations be disciplined. On 17 February 2004 an internal inquiry established that the investigator Mr Kirichevskiy had unlawfully decided to discontinue the proceedings before the medical examination had been completed. The investigator received a reprimand and his superior was demoted.', '67.  On 3 February 2004 the investigator Mr Shakhov from the Investigations Department of the Eastern Administrative District Police took up the case. He wrote to the applicant’s mother that those responsible for the loss of the medical record had been disciplined.', '68.  On 20 April 2004 the investigator Mr Shakhov commissioned a new medical study by the same experts and with the same questions. The previous study was considered inadmissible because it had been completed at the time when the proceedings had been suspended. On 17 May 2004 the new study was completed. The experts returned the same findings. They also noted that their task had been hampered by numerous corrections of entries, in particular dates and times, in the medical records from Hospital no. 33 and because of inexplicable contradictions in those entries.', '69.  On 20 May 2004 the investigator Mr Shakhov issued a decision suspending the proceedings on the ground that the authorised investigation period had expired. On 19 June 2004 the decision was annulled by a supervising prosecutor.', '70.  The investigation was transferred to Mr Buvin who suspended the proceedings on the same ground on 1 September and 19 November 2004. A public prosecutor set aside his decisions on 13 October and 18 December 2004.', '71.  On 18 January 2005 the investigator noted that the initial forensic examination had not determined the extent of correlation between the deficiencies in the medical assistance provided to the applicant at Hospital no. 33 and the damage to his health. He appointed a new medical examination by the experts from the Health Protection Department of the Moscow Government and suspended the proceedings in the case.', '72.  On 30 May 2005 the experts returned their findings which were based, in the absence of the original medical records, on the materials of the case file and extensive quotations from the original records in the text of the initial expert examination. The experts found that the applicant had suffered from a vascular pathology which had resulted in a subdural hematoma against the backdrop of a head trauma and alcohol intoxication. In their view, at the moment of the applicant’s admission to Hospital no. 33, no urgent surgery was required. The hematoma was allowed to grow over a period of time under constant supervision by medical specialists who awaited the most propitious moment for brain surgery. The experts concluded that the findings of the initial examination had been “objectively untenable” and that the diagnosis and surgery had been carried out in a timely and precise fashion. On the same day the public prosecutor ordered the proceedings to be resumed.', '73.  Further decisions concerning the discontinuance of the proceedings on various procedural grounds were issued on 18 January 2005 (annulled on 30 May) and 31 May 2005 (annulled on 24 June).', '74.  On 15 August 2005 the investigator decided to commission a further forensic examination with a view to eliminating the discrepancies between the findings of the first and second experts’ reports. It was entrusted to the Russian Centre for Forensic Medicine at the Federal Agency for Health Protection and Social Development. However, the Centre refused to conduct the examination in the absence of the original medical records. The director of the Centre’s First Department stated to the investigator that an examination on the basis of the case-file materials and previous findings by other experts would be “methodologically incorrect and in breach of the existing practice of expert examinations”.', '75.  On 6 September 2005 the investigator granted the applicant the status of a victim in the proceedings and recognised his mother as his legal representative.', '76.  On 28 April and 19 July 2006 the investigator Mr Volk decided to discontinue the proceedings on the ground that no offence had been committed. The decisions were set aside by supervising prosecutors.', '77.  The most recent decision on discontinuance of criminal proceedings, which the Court has in its possession, was made by the investigator Mr Volk on 29 November 2006. He took stock of the existing evidence, including the testimony by the doctors Mr K., Mr Ts. and Mr B. from Hospital no. 33, the ambulance doctors, the applicant’s friend Mr N., the applicant’s mother, and the applicant himself. The findings of the first and second forensic studies were extensively quoted, as were the reasons given by the federal centre for forensic examination for refusing to conduct a “conciliatory” study in the absence of the original documents. The investigator reached the following conclusion:\\n“Despite the existence of substantial discrepancies in the above-mentioned findings by two experts’ commissions as to the origins and development of [the applicant’s] disease and the professional level of treatment that was administered to him, neither commission could state that there was a link of causality between the treatment administered to [the applicant] and the consequences in the form of serious damage to the victim’s health.\\nIn these circumstances, the investigation finds that there are no objectively verifiable factual indications that Doctors K., Ts, and B. from Hospital no. 33 failed to render medical assistance to [the applicant] without valid reasons, thus resulting in serious damage to his health, that is, that they committed the offence under Article 124 § 2 of the Criminal Code.”', '78.  On the same date a supervising prosecutor quashed that decision and instructed Mr Volk to remedy the shortcomings in the investigation and, in particular, to locate the original medical documents.'], 'applicants': ['DENIS VASILYEV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '3', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['13', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['136', '74', '78']}, 'silver_rationales': [68, 72], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [68, 72], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 5, 4, 51, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 43, 52, 42, 40, 39, 38, 44, 53, 55, 37, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 54, 71, 36, 34, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 35, 19, 20, 21, 18, 22, 33, 31, 30, 29, 28, 72, 27, 26, 25, 24, 59, 50, 9, 32, 23, 68, 14, 41, 2, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.14304519, 0.1261583, 0.083533466, 0.07830918, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736481, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.06736475, 0.042742908, 0.022750616], 'number_of_sentences': 73, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

He is the owner of a grocery shop in Diyarbakır which he runs with his brother.', \"5.  According to the arrest report, drafted on 15 February 2001 at around 10.45 a.m. and signed by the applicant and his brother, police officers had received information that shopkeepers on Bal Street were not opening their shops as a protest to mark the second anniversary of the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party), an illegal armed organisation. When the officers arrived at the street in question they asked the applicant and his brother to open their shop. The applicant and his brother swore at them and shouted slogans. In the meantime, a small crowd of children and women had started to throw stones at the police cars. The police officers requested, via wireless radio, reinforcements from the police station. Two police officers sustained injuries while trying to arrest the applicant and his brother. The police officers then used force to subdue the applicant and his brother before arresting them for obstructing an official in the course of his duties. It is also stated that the suspects reached for the gun of one of the police officers. It appears that five police officers took part in the applicant and his brother's arrest.\", '6.  In his application form the applicant submitted that, on 15 February 2001, before he had opened the shutters of his shop, a number of police officers arrived and started smashing the shop shutters and windows with sledgehammers. When the applicant and his brother attempted to stop the police officers, they were beaten up, arrested and subsequently placed in police custody.', \"7.  According to a medical report drawn up at the Diyarbakır branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute the same day, at 2.20 p.m., there was a light 4 x 1cm reddish bruise and a traumatic oedema on the front of the applicant's left arm. There was also another red-coloured bruise, measuring 15 cm by 3cm, on the outside of his left thigh.\", \"8.  The same doctor also found a number of injuries on the applicant's brother, including a 1 x 1 cm wound on the right parietal region, a 4 x 1 cm bruise on the right side of his neck, a 10 x 3 cm bruise on the right side of his lower back and left shoulder, slight erosion on his right wrist and a number of superficial grazes.\", '9.  In the meantime, on the same day, two of the police officers were examined first at the State Hospital, and later at the Diyarbakır branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute.', '10.  According to the medical report drawn up at the State Hospital, at 10.50 a.m., police officer M.A.A. had sustained a haematoma on his left eye, had redness and sensitivity on the right side of his chest, a haematoma and swelling on his left hand and a swelling and superficial graze on his right hand. At 1.30 p.m. Mr M.A.A. was examined at the Forensic Medicine Institute, where the doctor found that the police officer had sustained a haematoma on his left eye and a traumatic oedema on his left cheek, pain and sensitivity on his left hand and the right side of his ribs and that he had slight erosion on the right hand.', '11.  According to the medical report drawn up at the State Hospital, at 10.50 a.m., police officer H.A.K. had a broad patch of redness on the right side of his neck and shoulder region. At 1.30 p.m. he was examined at the Forensic Medicine Institute, where the doctor found that the police officer had a number of reddish bruises on the right and front of the neck and felt pain and sensitivity in the right shoulder.', '12.  On 17 February 2001 the prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court granted the police authorisation to detain the applicant and seven other suspects who had been detained for similar acts on that date for an additional period of two days.', '13.  On 18 February 2001, while he was still being detained in police custody, the applicant was questioned. In the minutes of the questioning, the applicant was recorded as having stated that he sympathised with the policies of the PKK. On 13 February 2001 he had found a leaflet on the floor outside the shop that had been prepared and distributed by the PKK, inviting local businesses not to open their shops on 15 February. Following this invitation, he had intended not to open his shop until 1.30 p.m. He stated that he had followed such instructions in the past.', '14.  On 19 February 2001 the applicant was examined by a doctor at Diyarbakır State Hospital who noted a 5 cm bruise on the front of his right arm, a 10 cm bruise on the top of his left foot and a 5 cm bruise on his left thigh.', \"15.  The same day the applicant was brought before the prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court and then before the duty judge at the same court, where he retracted the statement he had made in police custody and said that he had merely been late in opening his shop on 15 February because he had guests at his house; he had not been protesting at all. In the statement taken by the prosecutor, the applicant was recorded as having said that “he had been beaten up by the police officers but he did not wish to make a complaint”. Before the duty judge the applicant claimed that a police officer named A.K. had hit him with a truncheon when he had tried to prevent the latter from breaking his door down, and that he had neither hit any of the police officers nor shouted any slogans. The duty judge ordered the applicant's remand in custody.\", '16.  On 21 February 2001 the prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed an indictment charging the applicant and his brother with the offence of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.', '17.  On 26 February 2001 the criminal proceedings before the Diyarbakır State Security Court (hereinafter “the SSC”) commenced.', '18.  In the meantime, on 20 February 2001 the applicant submitted a written petition to the trial court requesting his release. In particular, he claimed that, during his arrest, the police had beaten him and his brother with truncheons, but that he was not complaining about any particular police officer.', '19.  On 26 April 2001 the SSC held its first hearing, when it heard evidence from the accused, the police officers and defence witnesses. The applicant claimed, inter alia, that the police officers had tried to break the shutters of his shop with a sledgehammer and that, when he had tried to prevent them, by holding the sledgehammer, they had beaten and arrested him. He also retracted his statements given to the police on the ground that he had signed them without reading them. The four defence witnesses heard by the court stated that they had not seen the applicant shouting, resisting or swearing at the police or a crowd of people throwing stones at the police. Two of the four defence witnesses stated that the applicant had been beaten during his arrest.', '20.  The police officers who had arrested the applicant reiterated that the applicant and his brother had refused to open the shutters of their shop and that when, in accordance with the order from the Governor, they had tried to break open the shutters, the applicant and his brother had sworn at them and attacked them. They stated that a crowd of people had been shouting and swearing and attacking them, but that by the time the reinforcements arrived they had all dispersed; only the applicant and his brother had been arrested.', \"21.  In hearings held on 7 and 28 June 2001 both the prosecutor and the applicant's representative stated that they did not want an additional investigation. On the latter date the trial court released the applicant pending trial. It also decided to hear all the witnesses once again in order to dispel factual contradictions. After having reheard two of the defence witnesses, one of whom altered his testimony, on 21 November 2001 the trial court considered that, although certain inconsistencies remained, the facts had been sufficiently elucidated.\", \"22.  On 28 February 2002 the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months' imprisonment. The applicant's brother was acquitted.\", '23.  The applicant appealed and asked the Court of Cassation to hold a hearing. In his grounds of appeal the applicant claimed, in particular, that his statements given to the police had been taken under duress. He reiterated that, during the arrest, he and his brother had been beaten by the police officers, as attested by eyewitnesses, whereas there was no evidence that he and his brother were responsible for the injuries sustained by the police officers.', \"24.  In his written observations submitted to the Court of Cassation, the prosecutor asked for the conviction to be quashed as the applicant's guilt had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.\", \"25.  On 11 November 2002 the Court of Cassation, observing that the applicant's lawyer was absent, decided not to hold a hearing and upheld the applicant's conviction.\", '26.  On 26 August 2003 the applicant was released from prison.', \"27.  On 16 October 2003, upon a request by the applicant to benefit from Law no. 4959, the Diyarbakır State Security Court reviewed its previous decision and found that the applicant's conviction and sentence met the requirements of this Law. Accordingly, it “annulled” the applicant's conviction and sentence. Since no one objected to that decision, it became final on 24 October 2003.\"], 'applicants': ['ARAT'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['10', '11', '14', '15', '18', '19', '23', '43', '7'], 'X': ['3']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 3, 11, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 23, 22, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 12, 4, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.3290454, 0.101169586, 0.00031074882, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.04272598, -0.06387612, -0.10893127], 'number_of_sentences': 24, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On an unspecified date the applicant company was sued in relation to its failure to honour a contractual obligation, namely to construct roads and keep them in a good state of repair. On 27 June 2003 the first-instance court found against the applicant company and gave it three months to execute the works. The decision was confirmed, in part (in relation to certain roads), on appeal on 25 February 2005 by the Court of Appeal sitting in a three judge formation.', '7.  On 17 May 2005 the applicant company lodged a request for retrial under Article 811(e) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (“COCP”) (see Relevant domestic law below), and a request for a stay of execution of the judgment under Article 823 (2) of the COCP, pending the decision on the retrial request.', '8.  On 3 November 2005 the Court of Appeal, sitting in the same composition as in the appeal on the main proceedings, rejected the request for a stay of execution. It considered that the bank guarantee of 100,000 Maltese liras (“MTL”) offered by the applicant company was not a sufficient guarantee for the execution of a judgment which might involve expenses amounting to MTL 400, 000. A further request by the applicant company to be allowed to lodge the sum of MTL 400, 000 was also rejected on the same day.', '9.  On 9 November 2005 the applicant company requested the Court of Appeal to reconsider the said decision and asked for its revocation. It invoked Article 229 (4) of the COCP (see Relevant domestic law below). The matter, yet again, fell to be heard before the same composition of the Court of Appeal which gave the decision appealed against. The applicant company therefore lodged a request for the withdrawal of the three judges, under Article 734 (1) (d) (ii) of the COCP, on the basis that they could not be considered impartial since they had determined the merits of the claim subject to “appeal”.', '10.  On 14 December 2005, the Court of Appeal, in the same composition, dismissed the applicant company’s request for withdrawal and declared the appeal null and void. It held that a request for reconsideration under Article 229 (4) of the COCP did not require the said judges to withdraw. On the contrary, it implied that the case had to be reconsidered by precisely the same judges, and the claim was therefore frivolous and vexatious. As to the appeal, it considered that the decision of 3 November 2005 amounted to a final judgment against which no appeal lay, it being covered by Article 227 and not 229 of the COCP (see Relevant domestic law below).', '11.  On 2 April 2006 the applicant company instituted constitutional redress proceedings, claiming that its appeal proceedings culminating in the decision of 14 December 2005 had not been heard by an impartial tribunal.', '12.  On 10 October 2006 the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction found against the applicant company. It considered that, while it was true that the provisions of Articles 227 and 823 (6) of the COCP appeared contradictory, the logical interpretation of the provisions was that an appeal for dismissal of a request for a stay of execution was available only if the decision had been taken by a court other than the Court of Appeal. Had this not been the case, the applicant company would have had reason to question the Court of Appeal’s impartiality. However, the latter court had not reconsidered its decision of 3 November 2005, but abstained from taking cognisance of the request on the basis that it was null and void. Thus, the applicant company’s claim was unfounded.', '13.  The Constitutional Court on 17 October 2007 confirmed the Civil Court’s judgment. Noting that it had not been necessary for the Civil Court to enter into the interpretation given by the Court of Appeal, it held that on 14 December 2005 the Court of Appeal had not assessed its own previous conduct. It delivered a decision on a new legal question, namely the legal and procedural question of whether the appeal application was null and void, viz, whether the method of appeal used by the applicant company was one envisaged and allowed according to the COCP. It therefore did not decide on the merits of its previous decision. Moreover, it found that it had not been sufficiently proved that there was a real risk that the relevant judges had been biased. Indeed, the applicant company had not contested the impartiality of the Court of Appeal at the beginning of the proceedings, namely on the basis that the appeal in respect of the decision of 25 February 2005 had also been decided by the same formation of the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the judicial code of ethics, the judicial oath and the relevant law provisions in respect of withdrawal and abstention of judges offered a sufficient guarantee of impartiality.'], 'applicants': ['CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LIMITED'], 'defendants': ['MALTA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['13']}, 'silver_rationales': [7], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7], 'explained_indices': [2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7], 'explained_distances': [0.18790954, 0.14356118, 0.07725352, 0.07223475, 0.02644068, -0.003920257, -0.003920257, -0.003920257], 'number_of_sentences': 8, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

In the autumn of 1999, because of the armed clashes, the applicant and his family moved temporarily to the house of their relative, Mr S. Kh., at 9 Trudovaya Street, Martan-Chu, in Urus-Martan district. The village administration recorded the applicant as an internally displaced person.', '8.  According to the applicant, on 4 December 1999 between 11 a.m. and 12 noon advancing Russian federal forces subjected the area around Martan‑Chu to indiscriminate shelling. He submitted that the army had used “Grad” (“Град”) or “Uragan” (“Ураган”), multiple rocket launch systems, which were stationed about ten kilometres from the village. Several projectiles hit the village. One of them landed in the yard of Mr S. Kh. and hit a car which was parked there. The applicant was standing next to the car and received numerous splinter wounds, including to the head. According to the applicant’s submissions made to the Court, in June 2005 a part of the projectile which had wounded the applicant remained in Mr S. Kh.’s yard.', '9.  On 19 December 1999 the administration of Martan-Chu issued a paper which stated that the applicant and his cousin had been wounded as a result of the bombardment of the village on 4 December 1999 and that on the same date they had been taken to the hospital in Novyie Atagi, in Grozny district.', '10.  As a result of the wounding the applicant’s health deteriorated; he had become unable to work, which was recognised in 2001 by a forensic examination as second-degree disability. He receives a monthly disability pension.', '11.  According to the submitted documents, the applicant underwent several rounds of treatment in connection with his injuries. Between 4 and 21 December 1999 the applicant was in Novyie Atagi hospital. On 2 February 2000 a splinter was removed from his head. Between 2 and 29 August 2001 the applicant received post-operative treatment.', '12.  On 2 November 2004 the Urus-Martan district hospital summarised the state of the applicant’s health. According to the document, the applicant’s health had been monitored by the hospital since 2000; he required constant rehabilitation therapy.', '13.  Between 25 and 29 April 2008 the applicant was examined by the experts of the Chechnya Bureau of Forensic Expertise. According to their evaluation, the applicant had a penetrating wound to the right part of the frontal lobe with damage to the brain; such a wound could have been caused by a shell splinter and was qualified as serious damage to the applicant’s health.', '14.  On 11 March 2002 the applicant’s mother wrote to the Russian Ombudsman and asked for assistance in relation to the applicant’s situation. She indicated that her son had been injured on 4 December 1999 as a result of the shelling of Martan-Chu and that the family had been bearing the costs of complex medical interventions.', '15.  On 28 May 2003 the applicant’s mother informed the Urus‑Martan district prosecutor’s office (“the district prosecutor’s office”) about the applicant’s injury received during the bombardment on 4 December 1999. She alleged that the shelling of the village had been carried out by the servicemen of the “245th regiment”.', '16.  On 14 August 2003 the applicant’s mother complained about the applicant’s injuries to the Urus-Martan district police department (“the ROVD”) and requested the authorities to institute a criminal investigation into the events.', '17.  On 16 September 2003 the ROVD refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant’s wounding on 4 December 1999. The decision stated that the authorities had conducted an inquiry, which had established the following: a number of armed clashes, including exchanges of gunfire, had taken place between Russian forces and illegal armed groups in the area of the applicant’s residence in 1999. As a result of the bombardment of Martan-Chu the applicant was injured, which had been confirmed by the witness statements of Ms R. N., Mr R. Kh. and Mr B. The projectile, which had hit the yard of Mr S. Kh. and wounded the applicant, had been launched by one of the parties to the conflict. However, it was impossible to establish which party had launched the projectile. Thus, taking into consideration that the applicant had been injured as a result of an accident, the request for the institution of criminal proceedings was to be rejected pursuant to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code owing to the lack of corpus delicti.', '18.  On 16 September 2003 the ROVD informed the applicant about their decision concerning the refusal to institute criminal proceedings.', '19.  On 15 April 2004 the applicant brought proceedings against the Ministry of Finance. The applicant stated that as a result of the wounding on 4 December 1999 he had become incapacitated and unfit for work. He demanded compensation for pecuniary damage in the amount of 184,256 Russian roubles (RUB) and non-pecuniary damage in the amount of RUB 1,500,000.', '20.  In response to the applicant’s specific request, on 19 November 2004 the Martan-Chu administration issued a note that they “had no information about unprovoked artillery and air strikes” on the village, except for the air strikes which had occurred on 5 December 1999 and hit the households of Mr L.I. and Mr S.E.', '21.  On 2 December 2004 Urus-Martan Town Court (“the town court”) rejected the applicant’s claim. It stated that although as a result of the shelling on 4 December 1999 the applicant had been wounded and became partially incapacitated, he had failed to provide sufficient evidence which would allow the court to establish a causal link between the actions of the artillery of the Russian armed forces and the damage alleged by the applicant. In its ruling the court referred to the decision of 16 September 2003 to refuse criminal proceedings.', '22.  On 8 December 2004 the Martan-Chu administration issued a note to confirm that both on 4 and 5 December 1999 the village had been subjected to indiscriminate bombardment from the direction of the advancing Russian forces. On 4 December 1999 one of the projectiles had hit Mr S. Kh.’s yard and had destroyed his property, as confirmed by an official evaluation of damages and by witness statements. The shelling was also confirmed by the villagers’ statements. At the relevant time the applicant had been registered as an internally displaced person, was living with his relatives in Martan‑Chu and had become partially incapacitated as a result of the injury received on 4 December 1999.', '23.  The applicant appealed against the judgment of 2 December 2004 alleging that the town court had been partial and had failed to assess the evidence properly.', '24.  On 28 December 2004 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld the judgment. It found that the applicant’s appeal concerned reassessment of the evidence examined by the first-instance court and confirmed that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegations with appropriate evidence. The Supreme Court also pointed out that the applicant had failed to appeal against the authorities’ refusal to institute criminal proceedings on 16 September 2003, and emphasised that that decision was still valid and therefore had served legitimately as the basis for the court’s findings.', '25.  On 28 January 2005 the applicant asked the town court to set aside the ROVD decision not to institute criminal proceedings and to oblige the authorities to open a criminal investigation into his injuries.', '26.  On 18 February 2005 the town court allowed the applicant’s complaint and quashed the decision of 16 September 2003. The court stated that the police had failed to carry out basic investigative measures such as the examination of the crime scene, collection of evidence and forensic assessment of the applicant’s health.', '27.  On 29 May 2006 the applicant wrote to the ROVD and referred to the court decision of 18 February 2005. He asked about the latest developments in the case.', '28.  On 15 June 2006 the ROVD referred to their previous decision of 16 September 2003 not to institute criminal proceedings.', '29.  On 4 April 2008 the applicant again wrote to the ROVD and referred to the town court decision of 18 February 2005.', '30.  On 21 April 2008 the district prosecutor’s office remitted inquiry file no. 1159/809 opened in connection with the applicant’s complaint to the ROVD for additional examination and decision on the merits. Following this development, the ROVD carried out a number of investigative measures.', '31.  The Government, in response to the Court’s request, submitted thirty-five pages from the investigation file dated between April and July 2008. They argued that the remaining documents (no list or number of which has been provided) could not be disclosed, in the absence of guarantees by the Court to protect the data containing State secrets. Referring to Article 161 of the Criminal Procedural Code, the Government stated that the remaining documents could not be divulged without harming the interests of the investigation and the interests of the participants to the proceedings. The submitted documents and the parties’ submissions may be summarised as follows.', '32.  On 23 April 2008 the investigator examined Mr S.Kh.’s household and noted marks of shrapnel on some walls. Nothing of relevance to the investigation was collected.', '33.  According to the Government’s submissions, in April 2008 the local police in Martan-Chu had questioned two neighbours and the applicant’s cousin, who confirmed the circumstances in which the applicant was wounded on 4 December 1999. The police also questioned Mr M., who at the relevant time had headed the local administration in Martan-Chu. He corroborated the applicant’s submissions and testified that he had inspected Mr S.Kh.’s household shortly after the explosion and recorded the destruction. None of these statements were made available to the Court.', '34.  The police also obtained copies of the applicant’s medical file from the Achkhoy-Martan hospital.', '36.  The criminal investigation file was eventually opened by the ROVD on 2 May 2008 under Article 111 part 2 of the Criminal Code – causing of serious injuries by universally dangerous means.', '37.  The applicant was questioned on 23 April and 18 June 2008 (only the record of the latter has been submitted to the Court). He explained that on 4 December 1999 at about noon he and his cousin had been wounded as a result of a shell exploding in the courtyard of Mr S. Kh.’s house.', '38.  On 13 May 2008 the Chechnya Bureau of Forensic Expertise concluded that the applicant’s injuries could have been caused by a piece of shrapnel and that they constituted grievous bodily harm.', '40.  On 18 June 2008 the applicant’s mother was questioned. She gave similar account about the applicant’s wounding and about the treatment he had to undergo. She indicated that she was not aware who exactly had shelled the village, but she had heard that these were troops headed by General Shamanov.', '41.  On 26 June 2008 the applicant sought an award of RUB 1,500,000 in compensation for damage to his health against the perpetrators of the crime. On the same day the investigator accorded the applicant the status of a civil claimant.', '42.  On 2 July 2008 the investigation was adjourned for failure to identify the culprits. The decision stated that in order to identify the persons who had committed the crime the investigator had sent a number of requests for information to the various bodies of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior. Nothing of relevance to the investigation was obtained. No copies of any such requests or answers have been submitted to the Court.', '43.  On 5 November 2008 the investigative department of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya ordered that the investigation be resumed. The reason for the decision was that unspecified investigative measures had not been taken.', '44.  In February 2009 the applicant collected additional statements from his cousin, two neighbours and his mother and submitted them to the Court. These detailed statements concern the shelling and subsequent developments. In particular, the applicant’s cousin stated that the attack had been carried out from the north and with the use of multiple-launch rocket systems. He further stated that for several years after the event parts of the “Grad” rockets could be found in the village and described the one found in their courtyard. He alleged that on 4 December 1999 twenty-eight rockets (“Grad” is designed to launch forty projectiles) had hit the village and listed other households and places where the explosions had taken place. He alleged that in early December 2008 an investigator had collected one part of the projectile from the village for an expert evaluation. The applicant’s mother alleged that the investigator had informed her on the telephone that the expert report had identified the metal object collected in autumn 2008 in Martan-Chu as the tail part of the “Grad” missile. It appears that the investigation is still pending.'], 'applicants': ['NAKAYEV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '2'], 'violated_articles': ['2'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['10', '11', '12', '13', '15', '16', '17', '20', '22', '26', '31'], '13': ['75']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 24], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 24], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 19, 18, 17, 16, 6, 7, 34, 9, 10, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 11, 35, 2, 4, 3, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.099543855, 0.07532346, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.05831337, -0.14583361, -0.19361871, -0.20591241, -0.25290605], 'number_of_sentences': 36, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant is a public limited company whose registered office is in Hamburg. It publishes the Bild, a daily newspaper with a large circulation. The present case concerns the publication by the newspaper of two articles about X, a well-known television actor. Between May 1998 and November 2003 X had played the part of Police Superintendent Y, the hero of a television series broadcast on a private television channel in the evenings, until 2005. By October 2004, 103 episodes had been broadcast, the last 54 of which had starred X in the role of Police Superintendent Y. The average audience rating was 18% (between 3 and 4,700,000 viewers per episode).', '10.  On 14 June 2003 the applicant company revealed that X had been convicted of unlawful possession of drugs. After receiving a warning from X, it undertook, on pain of an agreed penalty, to refrain from publishing information according to which four grams of cocaine had been found at X’s home that he had had sent to him by post from Brazil and for which he had been given a prison sentence, suspended for five months, and fined 5,000 euros (EUR).', '11.  At approximately 11 p.m. on 23 September 2004 X was arrested at the Munich beer festival (Oktoberfest) for possession of cocaine. In a sworn statement (eidesstattliche Versicherung) a journalist from the applicant company declared that she had asked the police present at the scene whether X had been arrested and, if so, on what grounds. The police had confirmed that X had been arrested in the Käfer tent in possession of cocaine, without giving any further details.', '12.  According to that statement, the journalist had then contacted the public prosecutor, W., from the public prosecutor’s office of Munich Regional Court I, in charge of relations with the press, and had asked him for information. W. had confirmed that X had been arrested in the Käfer tent in possession of cocaine. According to W., plain-clothes police officers had arrested X because they had seen him making a suspicious movement with his hand when coming out of the toilets. The officers had searched him, and, having found him to be in possession of an envelope containing 0.23 grams of cocaine, had arrested him. According to W., the arrest had taken place at approximately 11 p.m. on 23 September and a criminal complaint was currently being investigated.', '13.  In its 29 September 2004 edition, the applicant company’s daily newspaper, the Bild, published the following headline in large type on its front page:\\n“Cocaine! Superintendent Y caught at the Munich beer festival.”\\nThe article, which was printed in small type, read as follows:\\n“He came out of the gents tapping his nose suspiciously and was arrested! At the beer festival the police caught X (... years old, Superintendent Y on television), in possession of a small envelope of cocaine. See page 12 for the details.”\\nThe following headline appeared on page twelve of the daily:\\n“TV star X caught in possession of cocaine. A bretzel (Brezn), a beer mug [containing a litre of beer – Maß] and a line of coke (Koks).”\\nThe article, printed in small type, read as follows:\\n“Thursday night, 11 p.m. At the beer festival there was drinking, partying, swaying arm in arm. And sniffing.... In the celebrities’ tent the TV star X (... years old, whose real name is ...) came out of the gents tapping his nose and attracting the attention of police officers. They searched the star actor from the TV series Y (of which, by June, there had been more than 60 episodes in five years). COCAINE! X had a packet on him containing 0.23 grams of coke, and was arrested. Public prosecutor W. from Munich told the Bild: “He was making suspicious movements with his hand, tapping his nose with his fingers. This of course attracted the attention of our officers. An investigation is under way. Only a small quantity of cocaine is involved though. W. : “Right in the middle of the festival grounds (Wiesn) – it might have been snuff tobacco, but our men have a flair for this sort of thing...”. X had already had a run-in with the law for possession of drugs. In July 2000 the Superintendent from the TV series had been given a five-month suspended prison sentence and two years’ probation and fined EUR 5,000. He was accused of illegally importing drugs. On a trip to Brazil X had arranged for four grams of cocaine to be sent to his address in Munich. His probation period ended two years ago. The quantity of the drug found in the tent ... is negligible. What can the actor expect? According to a legal expert questioned by Bild: “Even if the probation period is over the previous conviction is recent. X may get an unsuspended prison sentence – up to six months”. Why prison? “X has apparently not been sufficiently daunted by the suspended prison sentence”. The actor has probably had to submit to a forensic head hair examination. Each centimetre of hair will enable the expert to determine whether and how much cocaine was taken. Yesterday X refused to comment. P.S: “In every toilet cubicle in the tent ... there are signs saying: “The use of drugs is liable to prosecution!”\\nThe article was accompanied by three photos of X, one on the first page and the other two on page twelve.', '14.  On the same day, during the morning, press agencies and other newspapers and magazines reported on X’s arrest, referring in part to the article published in the Bild. That day the prosecutor W. confirmed the facts reported in the Bild to other written media and television channels, two of which (“RTL” and “pro7”) broadcast the same reports that evening. During one of the broadcasts the prosecutor W. made the following statement:\\n“The police officers saw X making a suspicious movement with his hand while coming out of the men’s toilets and concluded that he had taken something. They searched him and found an envelope containing 0.213 grams of cocaine. He had already been convicted of importing drugs and given a suspended prison sentence. He is not a first offender (Ersttäter). He should have known that he should not touch drugs. He can now expect a further prison sentence, even if the quantity found on him is insignificant.”', '15.  In its 7 July 2005 edition the Bild printed the following headline on its inside pages: “TV series Superintendent X confesses in court to having taken cocaine. He is fined 18,000 euros!”\\nThe article read as follows:\\n“Munich – On TV he plays a superintendent who puts criminals behind bars. Yesterday, it was the turn of the actor X (... years old, ...) to be hauled up in front of the court and confess! X, who had to explain himself to the Munich District Court [Amtsgericht] on charges of “unlawful possession of drugs”, has confessed to taking drugs! X’s counsel ... stated: “We fully acknowledge the offence with which we have been charged in the indictment”. X confessed to the court: “I have occasionally smoked cannabis and taken cocaine from time to time. This has not made me happy. It had not turned into a habit but is just something that I have done from time to time”. Question from the court ...: “Are you currently taking drugs?” Reply from X: “No, I smoke cigarettes.” The sentence: a fine of EUR 18,000. The court: “The accused’s full confession has counted in his favour.” On TV X continues investigating on the side of law and order. In Vienna he is in front of the cameras for the television series ... which should be starting on the second channel in the autumn.”\\nThe article was accompanied by a photo of X.', '16.  Immediately after the articles appeared, X. instituted proceedings against the applicant company in the Hamburg Regional Court. The applicant company attached to its initial reply the statement by its journalist (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above) and numerous press articles about X, including a number of interviews given by him, to Bunte magazine among others, together with photos of him.', '17.  On 30 September 2004 the Hamburg Regional Court imposed an injunction on publication of the article, following a request lodged by X on 29 September 2004. In a judgment of 12 November 2004 it confirmed the injunction. That judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 28 June 2005.\\nOn 6 October 2004 the Regional Court also imposed an injunction on publication of the photos illustrating the article. It confirmed that decision in a judgment of 12 November 2004. The applicant company did not challenge that judgment, which became final.\\n(b)  The main proceedings\\n(i)  Judgment of the Regional Court', '18.  On 11 November 2005 the Hamburg Regional Court prohibited any further publication of almost the entire first article, on pain of an agreed penalty, under Articles 823 § 1 and 1004 § 1 (by analogy) of the Civil Code (see paragraph 47 below), read in the light of the right to protection of personality rights (Allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht). It ordered the applicant company to pay EUR 5,000 as a penalty under the agreement and to reimburse the procedural expenses (EUR 811.88, plus statutory interest accrued from 4 November 2004).', '19.  According to the Regional Court, the article in question, which mentioned X’s name and was accompanied by photos of him, amounted to a serious interference with his right to the protection of his personality rights; the disclosure of his criminal conduct had, so to speak, resulted in his being pilloried and discredited in the eyes of the public. The court found that, despite those negative effects, reporting of that kind would nonetheless have been lawful in the event of serious crimes that were part of contemporary society and on which the press was entitled to report. Any interference with a criminal’s private sphere was limited, however, by the proportionality principle, which involved a balancing exercise between the competing interests. The court held that in the present case the right to protection of X’s personality rights prevailed over the public’s interest in being informed, even if the truth of the facts related by the daily had not been disputed. Neither the nature of the crime committed, nor the person of X, nor any other circumstances justified publication of the article at issue.', '20.  The court observed that whilst a drugs-related offence was not a petty crime, particularly as in the present case it had been cocaine, which was a hard drug, X had been in possession of only a small quantity of that drug and had not been accused of drug trafficking. The type of offence involved was of medium, or even minor, seriousness, was a very common one and there was no particular public interest in knowing about it. The court added that, unlike serious crimes (such as spectacular robberies, or murders), there were no particular circumstances distinguishing the offence in question from ordinary crimes, even if there was an assumption that drug abuse was more widespread amongst key figures from the arts world and the media than in other circles. Furthermore, the way in which the report had been made by the applicant company confirmed that the offence itself was not an important one. The report had focussed more on X’s person than on the offence, which would probably never have been reported in the press if it had been committed by a person unknown to the public. Similarly, the court pointed out, whilst X’s previous conviction for a similar offence was such as to increase the public’s interest, it was his only previous conviction and, moreover, dated back several years.', '21.  The court also found that publication of the articles in question was not justified by the person of X. The public did admittedly show an interest in Police Superintendent Y, a character in a relatively popular television series, but not in the actual person of the actor playing the part. There was nothing to suggest that X attracted the attention of the public on account of his performance as an actor or other activities bringing him within a circle of persons about whom the public had a need for regular information. The interest in X did not, in any event, go beyond the interest habitually manifested by the public in leading actors in German television series.', '22.  The court observed that the applicant company had published many articles about X over a period of six years and particularly over the last three years. The vast majority of these publications had, however, merely mentioned X’s name – often without a photo – among the names of celebrities invited to various events. Whilst it was undisputed that X had taken part in over 200 national and international cinematographic and televised productions, that did not convey much of an idea of his public importance. Indeed, actors could have starred in hundreds of television series and still remain little known to the public. There was no evidence that X had made a name for himself on account of any particular performance or that he had occupied a prominent position in society which had brought him into the public eye.', '23.  X had, to an extent, sought to attract the public’s attention by giving interviews to certain magazines between 2000 and 2003. He therefore had to be more tolerant towards reports published about him than other well‑known figures who avoided the limelight. According to the court, X had not, however, courted the public to a degree that he could be considered to have implicitly waived his right to the protection of his personality rights.', '24.  The Regional Court conceded that the fact that the actor had broken the law whereas on television he played the role of a superintendent entrusted with crime prevention was more entertaining for the public than if the actor had played any other kind of role. However, that contrast between the television role and the personal lifestyle of the actor did not mean that the public confused the latter with the fictional character. The actor merely donned the persona of a superintendent, just as he could don that of any other character, without thereby adopting the conduct of the character in question in his daily life. The fact that an actor did not adopt the lifestyle of the character he played could not in any way be regarded as an extraordinary event worthy of being reported. In the court’s view, viewers could distinguish between the actor and his role, even where the actor was well known essentially for playing one particular character.', '25.  The Regional Court found, further, that X had not sought to portray himself as an emblem of moral virtue; neither had he adopted a stand on matters relating to drug abuse. The interviews reported by the applicant company contained no comment by X on the subject. In issue no. 48/2003 of the magazine Bunte, X had stated, in passing, that he did not have any alcohol in the house and that he had become a big tea connaisseur. In the court’s view, the fact that X had briefly remarked on his previous conviction in two interviews with magazines in 2000 and 2001 did not mean that he had portrayed himself as an advocate or critic of the fight against drugs or as an expert in the field. That subject had been only marginally covered in the interview, which had mainly concerned the actor’s professional prospects and his difficulties in his relationships.', '26.  Observing that when balancing the competing interests, the decisive criteria were how well known X was and the seriousness of the offence with which he was charged, the Regional Court found that the case concerned an actor who was not exceptionally well known and was accused of an offence which, while not insignificant, was not particularly spectacular and could be regarded as fairly common in the entertainment world. The public did not therefore have a great interest in being informed of an event that was actually fairly anodyne, whereas the information published amounted to a serious (gravierend) interference with X’s right to the protection of his personality rights.', '27.  The Regional Court found, lastly, that the applicant company was not justified in arguing that the publication of the article was lawful because it pursued legitimate interests. Admittedly, the press officer from the public prosecutor’s office at the Munich Regional Court I had informed a large number of media reporters of the offence with which X had been charged and had disclosed his identity to them; nor was there any doubt that the public prosecutor’s office could be regarded as a “privileged source” (privilegierte Quelle) of information that did not, as a general rule, require verification as to the truth of its content. Moreover, three press agencies had disclosed similar details. However, even assuming that it had received all the information before publishing the article in question, the applicant company could only conclude that the published information was true and was not thereby absolved from the requirement to check whether its publication was justified in terms of X’s right to protection of his personality rights. In the court’s opinion, the question of the veracity of information issued by a public authority had to be distinguished from that of the lawfulness of the subsequent publication of that information by the press.', '28.  The court found that it could be presumed that institutions providing a public service, and in particular the public prosecutor’s office and the police, made every effort, in accordance with the principle of neutrality, not to issue information unless the public interest in doing so had been carefully weighed against that of the persons concerned. However, such institutions were not necessarily in a better position than a publisher to weigh the conflicting interests at stake regarding the dissemination of the information through the media.', '29.  In the instant case the applicant company was actually better placed than a member of the Munich public prosecutor’s office to judge the degree to which X was known and the question regarding whether the public had an interest in learning of his arrest. On that point the court considered that account also had to be taken of the context in which the information was published: the public services were not in a position to anticipate every possible form of dissemination of factual information in any foreseeable context or to foresee whether a report mentioning the person’s name was justified or not. Accordingly, publishers could not generally consider that the disclosure of a person’s identity by a privileged source would make any kind of report on the person concerned legal, without having first balanced the interests at stake.', '30.  The Regional Court pointed out that there were situations in which there may be doubts regarding the assessment by the public authorities. Accordingly, in the case of X, the question arose as to whether it was appropriate for the public prosecutor’s office to have expressed an opinion on the sentence that X could expect to receive when the criminal investigation had only just started. The court concluded that the applicant company could not argue that it had relied on the disclosure of X’s name by the public prosecutor’s office.\\n(ii)  Judgment of the Court of Appeal', '31.  On 21 March 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company, but reduced the amount of the agreed penalty to EUR 1,000. It upheld the conclusions of the Regional Court, pointing out that the disclosure of a suspect’s name when reporting on an offence constituted, as a general rule, a serious infringement of the right to the protection of personality rights, even if it was a drug offence of medium or minor seriousness. In X’s case the fact of informing the public that he had taken cocaine could adversely affect his future prospects of securing acting roles and, in particular, of obtaining a role in an advertisement or in television series aimed at a young audience.', '32.  The Court of Appeal reiterated the relevant criteria when balancing the rights of the press against the right to protection of personality rights, as established by the Federal Court of Justice (see paragraph 48 below). It confirmed that the nature of the offence and the exact circumstances in which it had been committed made it an everyday offence and would not have aroused any interest if the perpetrator had been little known. In the court’s opinion, the possession and consumption of low quantities of drugs did not have adverse effects on third parties or on the general public. As X had not taken cocaine in the tent in front of everyone, his conduct did not imperil a young audience that might be likely to imitate him on account of his being a well-known television star.', '33.  The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the public had a particular interest in being informed and entertained because X was a well-known figure and had played the part of a police superintendent over a long period of time (längerer Zeitraum). However, even if X played that role, this did not mean that he had himself necessarily become an idol or role model as a law-enforcement officer, which could have increased the public’s interest in the question whether in his private life he actually behaved like his character. It was clear that the actor X could not be identified with the fictitious character of Superintendent Y that he played. The fact that X had his fan clubs and had made public appearances as the actor who played the part of Superintendent Y did not alter that finding. It could well be that X’s appearance, his manner of presenting himself, and the relaxed attitude portrayed in his films appealed to others, particularly a young audience. That did not mean, though, that others saw in him a moral role model whose image should be corrected by the newspaper report in question.', '34.  The publications submitted by the applicant company were indeed evidence that X was hugely popular, but did not support the contention that he had used confessions about his private life to attract the public’s attention. Nor was the newspaper report justifiable on the ground that X had been arrested in public, in a tent, because the drug had actually been consumed in the men’s toilets, that is, in a place that fell within the protected private sphere, and out of public view. Lastly, even if it were to be established that X’s arrest was a matter of substantial public interest, the same could not be said of the description and characterisation of the offence committed out of public view.', '35.  Lastly, while upholding the conclusions of the Regional Court regarding the role of the Munich public prosecutor’s office, the Court of Appeal stated that the applicant company’s liability did not extend beyond minor negligence given that the information disclosed by the public prosecutor’s office had led it to believe that the report was lawful. The illegal disclosure by the public prosecutor’s office did not, however, make publication by the applicant company legal. The Court of Appeal accordingly reduced the agreed penalty to EUR 1,000. It refused leave to appeal on points of law because its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice.\\n(iii)  The decisions of the Federal Court of Justice', '36.  On 7 November 2006 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law.', '37.  On 11 December 2006 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions (Anhörungsrüge). It stated that when balancing the public’s interest in being informed about public criminal proceedings against an interference with the defendant’s private sphere, the Court of Appeal had taken into account the circumstances of the case and had reached its decision in accordance with the criteria established in its case-law. There was no evidence that the relevant criteria for the balancing exercise had been disregarded. The Federal Court of Justice stated that the fact that the civil courts had found against the applicant company did not permit the latter to lodge an appeal on points of law and did not amount to a violation of the right to be heard.', '38.  On 15 August 2005 the Hamburg Regional Court granted an application by X for an injunction against any further publication of the second article.\\n(b)  The main proceedings\\n(i)  Judgment of the Regional Court', '39.  By a judgment of 5 May 2006, the Regional Court granted X’s application in the main proceedings, ordered the applicant company to refrain from any further publication of the second article on pain of penalty and ordered it to pay EUR 449.96 in costs, plus statutory interest accrued from 22 September 2005. It based its decision on essentially the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of 11 November 2005 (see paragraphs 18-30 above). It stated that the case in question had to be distinguished from the one that had been the subject of the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 15 November 2005 (see paragraph 48 below) in that the person concerned in that case, Prince Ernst August von Hannover, was much more widely known than X, so the press had been entitled to report on the substantial penalty imposed in that case.\\n(ii)  Judgment of the Court of Appeal', '40.  On 12 September 2006 the Hamburg Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company on essentially the same grounds as those given in its judgment of 21 March 2006 (see paragraphs 31-35 above). On the subject of the relevant criteria for weighing the conflicting interests, it stated that, according to the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 13 June 2006 (see paragraph 49 below), the fact that a person was a prominent figure or one known to the public was not a sufficient factor in itself to justify the existence of an interest on the part of the public in being informed of his or her conduct. In the present case, the public’s interest in being informed and entertained, which derived from the fact that X was a well-known figure and starred as a superintendent in a television series, was insufficient to justify the interference with his right to decide for himself which information he was willing to disclose (informationelle Selbstbestimmung).', '41.  The applicant company’s reliance on the high audience rating of the television series Y. did not, in the Court of Appeal’s opinion, prove that X. had served as a role model or a counter model. If a role model existed for millions of viewers, the role model in question was the character of the superintendent. The Court of Appeal reiterated that the fact that X. had been arrested in a public place did not make the newspaper article lawful because the offence itself had been committed out of public view, in the men’s toilets. The suspicious movement that X had made with his hand had admittedly attracted the attention of the police at the scene, but it had not been established that other persons present in the tent had noticed that X had taken cocaine.', '42.  The Court of Appeal added that whilst the fact that the “quality press” had reported the case might indicate that there was a not insignificant (nicht geringes) interest in reporting it, that was not a basis on which to conclude that the interference with X’s right to the protection of his personality rights had been lawful.', '43.  The Court of Appeal refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, in particular the latter’s judgment of 15 November 2005 (see paragraph 48 below).\\n(iii)  Decisions of the Federal Court of Justice', '44.  On 17 April 2007 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law. On 12 June 2007 it dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions.', '45.   On 5 March 2008 a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court declined to entertain constitutional appeals lodged by the applicant company against the court decisions delivered in the first and second sets of proceedings. It stated that it was not giving reasons for its decision.', '46.  On 12 September 2006 and 29 January 2008 the Hamburg Regional Court ordered the applicant company to pay X two penalty payments of EUR 5,000, each one for having breached the order of 15 August 2005 (see paragraph 38 above). The court criticised the applicant company for, inter alia, publishing in the 7 July 2006 edition of the daily newspaper Die Welt and on the newspaper’s internet page (welt.de) on 22 March 2007 the following statement by one of its editors:\\n“Accordingly, we had no right whatsoever to report on the trial of the popular actor X for possession of cocaine, even though he was a very well-known recidivist and the offence was committed at the beer festival in Munich.”'], 'applicants': ['AXEL SPRINGER AG'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10', '8'], 'violated_articles': ['10'], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['11', '12', '13', '15', '18', '20', '22', '23', '25', '27', '28', '29', '30', '32', '33', '34', '35', '39', '47', '69'], '41': ['31', '46']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 30], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 30], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 3, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 21, 20, 18, 36, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 11, 37, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.032717288, 0.022106588, -0.005201459, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.010324359, -0.01344651], 'number_of_sentences': 38, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

At the material time the applicants were employed by the CJSC “AeroSvit Airlines” (“AeroSvit”) as aircraft cabin crew.', '7.  As confirmed, in particular, by the minutes of the trade union’s constituent assembly of 2 July 2003, all the applicants were members of the company’s trade union. Mr Tymoshenko was its chairman.', '8.  On 16 February 2011 the National Mediation and Reconciliation Service (“the NMRS”) registered a collective labour dispute between the employees and the management of AeroSvit. The employees’ demands concerned, in particular, the following issues:\\n- repairs to the aircraft electronic catering and air-conditioning equipment;\\n- enhancing the safety of on-flight technical processes;\\n- salary payments to be made no later than three days before a period of leave;\\n- full and timely salary payments twice per month;\\n- a 3% pay rise and recalculation of salaries for 2009 and 2010;\\n- salary payment on the basis of the exchange rate of the US dollar and the Ukrainian hryvnia as established by the National Bank of Ukraine, with salaries to be recalculated from 2008;\\n- recalculation of long-service bonuses;\\n- ensuring transportation of aircraft cabin crew to and from the airport;\\n- establishing a USD 50 per diem allowance for all foreign flights;\\n- uniform cleaning and ironing to be at the employer’s expense;\\n- allocation of at least 0.3% of the salary budget for cultural and sporting events;\\n- awarding employees a bonus of 3.23% from the 2008 profits; and\\n- inflation adjustment of salaries if payment was delayed, with effect from December 2008.', '9.  On 16 March and 12 April 2011 the NMRS deregistered some of the employees’ demands, noting that they had been resolved, with reference to decisions of the reconciliation commissions of 28 February, 10 and 30 March 2011.', '10.  On 27 May 2011 the NMRS Labour Arbitration Court delivered its decision on the employees’ remaining demands, following a hearing in which representatives of both parties participated. It found most of the demands to be legitimate and directed the employer to comply with them.', '11.  In the absence of any compliance measures, AeroSvit cabin crew, including the applicants, decided to embark on industrial action.', '12.  On 9 September 2011 the general meeting of AeroSvit employees, seeking resolution of the labour dispute, announced a strike of 150 aircraft cabin crew members. The strike was due to start on 28 September 2011 and continue until the employees’ demands were fully met. The announcement specified that all foreign flights which began prior to the beginning of the strike would be completed. The meeting appointed a strike committee of six persons (including all of the applicants except Mr Pushnyak, who, however, attended the meeting and voted in favour of the strike). The committee was vested with the following powers: to conduct negotiations on behalf of the employees with the company’s management and State authorities; to draw attention to the strike in the mass media; to receive information from the company’s management on compliance with the employees’ requirements; to initiate and participate in a reconciliation commission; to organise and conduct meetings and pickets in support of the demands put forward; to sign agreements with the owner or an authorised representative on resolution of the labour dispute; and to consult the NMRS.', '13.  By 12 September 2011 the strike committee had notified the following authorities about the decision to hold a strike: the employer, the NMRS, the Infrastructure Ministry, the State Aviation Administration, the Social Policy Ministry, the State Labour Inspection, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, as well as a number of other institutions and organisations.', '14.  On 19 September 2011 the management of AeroSvit lodged a claim with the Darnytskyy District Court of Kyiv (“the Darnytskyy Court”) against the flight attendants’ trade union, seeking to have the strike declared unlawful.', '15.  On 26 September 2011 the Darnytskyy Court held the first hearing on the case. Another hearing was scheduled for the morning of 28 September 2011.', '16.  The planned hearing did not take place for reasons unknown to the applicants. They later discovered that the judge had been on sick leave.', '17.  On 28 September 2011 the management of AeroSvit Airlines brought another claim, this time before the Boryspil City Court (“the Boryspil Court”) and against the strike committee, seeking to have the strike declared unlawful.', '18.  On 29 September 2011 the Boryspil Court, in written proceedings, issued an injunction prohibiting the strike committee from holding the strike pending adjudication of the employer’s claim.', '19.  On the same day AeroSvit’s management handed over a copy of the injunction to the trade union’s representatives.', '20.  On 30 September 2011 the company’s management withdrew its earlier claim from the Darnytskyy Court.', '21.  On 4 October 2011 the trade union challenged the Boryspil Court’s injunction of 29 September 2011 before the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”). It submitted, in particular, that the strike committee could not be a respondent in proceedings, since it was neither an individual nor a legal entity. Nor was it empowered to act in courts on behalf of the employees who had decided to go on strike.', '22.  On 5 October 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed the aforementioned appeal.', '23.  On 6 October 2011 the Boryspil Court found that the strike would be unlawful and banned it. The court relied on section 18 of the Transport Act, which prohibited strikes at transport enterprises if they affected passenger carriage. It noted that AeroSvit was an important passenger carrier operating over eighty international routes to thirty-three counties. Furthermore, given that one of the major tasks of the aircraft cabin crew was to ensure the safety of passengers, the court considered applicable section 24 of the Resolution of Labour Disputes Act, which prohibited strikes if they were likely to endanger human life or health. It also made a general reference to Article 44 of the Constitution.', '24.  The trade union appealed. It reiterated the arguments of its earlier appeal of 4 October 2011 concerning the standing of the strike committee. It also argued that the first-instance court had wrongly applied the Transport Act, when it should instead have applied the Resolution of Labour Disputes Act.', '25.  On 22 November and 19 December 2011 respectively the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal and the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters upheld the judgment of 6 October 2011.', '26.  On 20 January 2012 the Specialised Court’s final ruling was served on the strike committee.', '27.  Article 44 reads as follows:\\n“Employees have the right to strike in order to protect their economic and social interests.\\nThe procedure for exercising the right to strike shall be established by law, taking into account the need to ensure national security, the protection of health, and the rights and freedoms of other persons.\\nNo one shall be forced to participate or to not participate in a strike.\\nA strike may only be prohibited on the basis of law.”', '28.  The pertinent provisions are the following:\\nSection 3. Parties to a collective labour dispute\\n“The parties to a collective labour dispute shall be:\\n- at an occupational level – employees (certain categories of employees) ... or a trade union, or another organisation authorised by employees [to represent their interests] and the owner of an enterprise ... or [the employer’s] representative ...\\nThe body authorised by employees to represent [their interests] shall be the only authorised representative of the employees during the period such a dispute exists...”\\nSection 17. Strike\\n“A strike is a temporary, collective and voluntary cessation of work by employees (non-appearance at work, breach of labour duties) ... with the aim of resolving a collective labour dispute.\\nStrike action shall be an extreme means of resolving a collective labour dispute (when all other possibilities [for such resolution] have been exhausted) if [the employer] refuses to allow the claims of employees or of a body authorised by them, or of a trade union, or of an association of trade unions or of a body authorised by them.”\\nSection 18. The right to strike\\n“Pursuant to Article 44 of the Constitution of Ukraine, employees have the right to strike in order to protect their economic and social interests.\\nThe procedure for exercising the right to strike is established by this Act.\\nA strike may be commenced if conciliatory procedures have not led to the settlement of a collective labour dispute or if [the employer] avoids conciliatory procedures or does not comply with an agreement reached in the course of resolution of a collective labour dispute...”\\nSection 24. Cases in which it is prohibited to strike\\n“Striking shall be prohibited if the cessation of work by employees endangers human life or health or the environment, or if it hinders the prevention of a natural disaster, an accident, a catastrophe, an epidemic or an epizootic outbreak, or if it hampers rectification of their consequences.\\nEmployees (with the exception of technical and maintenance personnel) of prosecution authorities, courts, military forces, state authorities, security and law-enforcement bodies shall be banned from striking...”\\nPART V. FINAL PROVISIONS.\\n“...3. Until other laws and by-laws are brought into compliance with this Act, they shall apply so far as they do not contradict it. 4. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine shall submit proposals for bringing other laws and by-laws into compliance with this Act within three months...”', '29.  Section 18 “Strikes at transport enterprises” provides:\\n“Cessation of work (strike) at transport enterprises may take place if the enterprise’s management fails to comply with tariff agreements, except in cases where passenger transportation or maintenance of a continuous production cycle are concerned, and also where a strike would endanger human life or health.”', '30.  The above provision has not been amended since the Act entered in force in 1994. Some proposed amendments were drafted in 2001 following recommendations by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, but with no result (see paragraphs 38-40 below). Furthermore, on 26 August 2010 a draft law “On amendments to section 18 of the Transport Act with a view to bringing it into conformity with the Constitution of Ukraine and the Resolution of Labour Disputes (Conflicts) Act” was registered in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament). The final version of the draft proposed repealing section 18 altogether. On 15 June 2011 the Parliamentary Committee for Transport and Communication recommended that Parliament reject the draft text, and referred to the Cabinet of Ministers’ position that it would destabilise the transport sector and be harmful to the social and economic interests of the State. In consequence, the draft text was rejected.', '31.  On 15 January 2013 the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights issued a press release with the following content:\\nMs Valeriya Lutkovska: “The right of transport employees to strike must be settled on the legislative level”\\n“The Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Valeriya Lutkovska, has sent a letter to Mr Mykola Azarov, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, concerning protection of the constitutional right to strike of transport employees. Representatives of the All-Ukrainian Trade Union of Pilots and also a trade union of stewards in an airline company have repeatedly applied to the Ombudsman concerning the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Ukrainian Transport Act and violation of their legitimate rights.\\nMonitoring by the Commissioner has revealed that inadequate regulation of this issue has in fact made it impossible to protect the rights of transport employees, and has led to ambiguous interpretation of certain provisions of the law... In addition, [this lack of regulation] genuinely raises the possibility of mass violations of employment law by employers, and, at the same time, unplanned (unexpected) instances of unavailability of transportation services, etc.\\nThe working group created by the Commissioner for Human Rights, with participation by representatives from the Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Economic Development and the National Service for Mediation and Reconciliation, and delegates from the joint representative bodies of employers and trade unions, drew up the draft Law of Ukraine “On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine concerning guarantees for exercising the constitutional right to strike”. It was proposed that section 18 of the Ukrainian Transport Act be worded as follows: “Strikes at transport enterprises shall take place in accordance with the legislation on the resolution of collective labour disputes (conflicts)”. The words “[or] national security” were added to section 24 (1) of the Ukrainian Law “On the resolution of collective labour disputes (conflicts)” immediately after the words “human health”.\\nAccording to the Commissioner for Human Rights Ms Valeriya Lutkovska, the Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Secretariat of the Council of National Security and Defence and the trade-union representatives of trade unions agreed to the draft law without observations.\\nTaking into consideration the importance of resolving this issue on the legislative level, the Ombudsman Ms Valeriya Lutkovska...submitted for the Government’s consideration the draft law thus drawn up, for subsequent submission to the Verkhovna Rada. The Prime Minister, Mr Mykola Azarov, instructed the heads of the Ministries of Infrastructure, Social Policy, Economic Development, Finance and Justice to examine the draft of the above-mentioned law and to introduce the agreed proposals to it. The Commissioner for Human Rights hopes that the draft law will soon be submitted for consideration by Parliament.”', '32.  Article 8 § 1 of the Covenant reads as follows:\\n“1. The States Parties to the present Convention undertake to ensure:\\n(a) The right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others;\\n(b) The right of trade unions to establish national federations or confederations and the right of the latter to form or join international trade union organisations;\\n(c) The right of trade unions to function freely subject to no limitations other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others;\\n(d) The right to strike, provided that it is exercised in conformity with the laws of the particular country.”', '33.  The pertinent principles of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are summarised in its publication “ILO Principles Concerning the Right to Strike”, first published in the International Labour Review, Vol. 137 (1998), No. 4, with a further edition in 2000. The relevant extracts read as follows: 1.  General issuesThe basic principle of the right to strike\\n“... Over the years, in line with this principle, the Committee on Freedom of Association has recognized that strike action is a right and not simply a social act, and has also: 1. made it clear it is a right which workers and their organizations (trade unions, federations and confederations) are entitled to enjoy...; 2. reduced the number of categories of workers who may be deprived of this right, as well as the legal restrictions on its exercise, which should not be excessive; 3. linked the exercise of the right to strike to the objective of promoting and defending the economic and social interests of workers...; 4. stated that the legitimate exercise of the right to strike should not entail prejudicial penalties of any sort, which would imply acts of anti-union discrimination.\\nThese views expressed by the Committee on Freedom of Association coincide in substance with those of the Committee of Experts...” 3.  Workers who enjoy the right to strike and those who are excluded\\n“... the Committee has chosen to recognize a general right to strike, with the sole possible exceptions being those which may be imposed for public servants and workers in essential services in the strict sense of the term. Obviously, the Committee on Freedom of Association also accepts the prohibition of strikes in the event of an acute national emergency (ILO, 1996d, para. 527)...”\\nEssential services in the strict sense of the term\\n“Over time, the supervisory bodies of the ILO have brought greater precision to the concept of essential services in the strict sense of the term (for which strike action may be prohibited). In 1983, the Committee of Experts defined such services as those “the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population” (ILO, 1983b, para. 214). This definition was adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association shortly afterwards.\\nClearly, what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term “depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country”; likewise, there can be no doubt that “a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population” (ILO, 1996d, para. 541). The Committee on Freedom of Association has none the less given its opinion in a general manner on the essential or non-essential nature of a series of specific services.\\nThus, the Committee has considered to be essential services in the strict sense, where the right to strike may be subject to major restrictions or even prohibitions, to be: the hospital sector; electricity services; water supply services; the telephone service; air traffic control (ibid., para. 544).\\nIn contrast, the Committee has considered that, in general the following do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term, and therefore the prohibition to strike does not pertain (ibid., para 545):\\n... transport generally; ... aircraft repairs..\\nThese few examples do not represent an exhaustive list of essential services. The Committee has not mentioned more services because its opinion is dependent on the nature of the specific situations and on the context which it has to examine and because complaints are rarely submitted regarding the prohibition of strikes in essential services...”\\nTerminological clarification regarding the concept of essential service and minimum service\\n“... When the Committee of Experts uses the expression “essential services” it refers only to essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population), in which restrictions or even a prohibition may be justified, accompanied, however, by compensatory guarantees. Nevertheless, a “minimum service” “would be appropriate in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where, without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers, one might consider ensuring that users’ basic needs are met and that facilities operate safely or without interruption” (ibid., para. 162) ...”', '34.  In the General Survey on the fundamental Conventions concerning rights at work in the light of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalisation (International Labour Conference, 101st session, 2012), the ILO Committee of Experts on the Implementation of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) indicated that the air transport should be excluded from “essential services” and that the right to strike of workers employed in that sector should be recognised.', '35.  On 23 February 1999 the Independent Trade Union of Workers of the Illichivsk Maritime Commercial Port lodged a complaint with the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association against the Government of Ukraine, alleging violations of trade union rights, including the right to strike. The Government’s reply was that, under the Transport Act, strikes were prohibited in continuously operating transport enterprises.', '36.  In its Report No. 318 of November 1999 (Report in which the committee requests to be informed of development), the Committee stated:\\n“514. In cases concerning violations of the right to strike, the Committee has always recognized the right to strike of workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests. It has also considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled under the law in order to render a strike lawful should be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organizations. ... The Committee has also emphasized that while the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term, that is, services the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population, provided that the workers are given appropriate guarantees, port activities generally do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term, although they are an important public service in which a minimum service could be required in case of a strike. ... The Committee, therefore, requests the Government to amend section 18 of the Transport Act to ensure that it cannot be construed as prohibiting strikes in ports.\\n... 516. In the light of its foregoing conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:\\n...\\n(d) As regards the court rulings that the strike planned for 7 September 1998 was illegal, the Committee, emphasizing that the ports do not constitute essential services in which strikes might be prohibited, although they are important public services in which a minimum service might be required in the event of a strike, requests the Government to amend section 18 of the Transport Act in order to ensure that it cannot be construed as allowing the prohibition of strikes in ports.”', '37.  Subsequently, the Committee issued several reports on the effect given to its recommendations.', '38.  In particular, in November 2001 it issued Report No. 323, in which it referred to the Government’s communication of August 2001 stating that the Ministry of Transport was preparing a new transport bill, which would include the following provisions:\\n“Voluntary cessation of work (strike) in transport undertakings may be initiated in accordance with the procedure established under relevant legislation. Except in cases where such cessation of work would endanger the life and health of individuals or pose an environmental threat, hinder the prevention of natural disasters, accidents or major incidents, epidemic or epizootic outbreaks, or impede efforts to deal with the consequences of such events.”', '39.  The Committee “note[d] with interest” the draft amendment in respect of section 18 of the Transport Act concerning strike action and requested the Government to keep it informed of the progress made in this respect.', '40.  The examination of the case by the Committee was, however, completed without any such progress being reported (see also paragraph 30 above concerning further drafting efforts).', '41.  The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association has published its conclusions in a number of other transport cases in which it was found that restrictions on the right to strike are not in conformity with the ILO standards.', '42.  In particular, the relevant extracts from its 362nd Report (312th Session, Geneva, November 2011) read as follows:\\n- Case No 2841 (France): Report in which the Committee requests to be kept informed of developments:\\n“1041. The Committee recalls that, in the airport sector, only air traffic control can be regarded as an essential service justifying restrictions on the right to strike. Neither the distribution of fuel to ensure that flights continue to operate, nor transport per se, can be therefore considered essential services in the strictest sense of the term. Moreover, economic consideration should not be invoked as a justification for restrictions on the right to strike. However, the Committee has, in the past, had cause to consider that when a service that is not essential in the strict sense of the term but is part of a very important sector in the country – as could be said of passenger and goods transport – is brought to a standstill, measures to guarantee a minimum service may be justified. Such a service could also be a potential alternative solution in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where, without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers, one might consider ensuring that users’ basic needs are met or facilities operate safely or without interruption.”\\n- Case No 2838 (Greece): Report in which the Committee requests to be kept informed of developments:\\n“1076. ...the transportation of passengers and commercial goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term; however, this is a public service of primary importance where the requirement of a minimum service in the event of a strike can be justified... In general, the determination of minimum services and the minimum number of workers providing them should involve not only the public authorities, but also the relevant employers’ and workers’ organizations. This not only allows a careful exchange of viewpoints on what in a given situation can be considered to be the minimum services that are strictly necessary, but also contributes to guaranteeing that the scope of the minimum service does not result in the strike becoming ineffective in practice because of its limited impact, and to dissipating possible impressions in the trade union organizations that a strike has come to nothing because of over-generous and unilaterally fixed minimum services.”', '43.  The relevant provisions read as follows:\\n“Article 6 – The right to bargain collectively\\nWith a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to bargain collectively, the Contracting Parties undertake: 2. to promote, where necessary and appropriate, machinery for voluntary negotiations between employers or employers’ organisations and workers’ organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements; 3. to promote the establishment and use of appropriate machinery for conciliation and voluntary arbitration for the settlement of labour disputes;\\nand recognise: 4. the right of workers and employers to collective action in cases of conflicts of interest, including the right to strike, subject to obligations that might arise out of collective agreements previously entered into.\\nArticle G[2] – Restrictions\\nThe rights and principles set forth in Part I when effectively realised, and their effective exercise as provided for in Part II, shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations not specified in those parts, except such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health, or morals.\\nThe restrictions permitted under this Charter to the rights and obligations set forth herein shall not be applied for any purpose other than that for which they have been prescribed.\\nAppendix to the Social CharterArticle 6, paragraph 4\\nIt is understood that each Contracting Party may, insofar as it is concerned, regulate the exercise of the right to strike by law, provided that any further restriction that this might place on the right can be justified under the terms of Article G1.”', '44.  In its Digest of the case-law of the European Committee of Social Rights of 1 September 2008, the Committee (whose function is to rule on the conformity of the situation in signatory States with the European Social Charter) stated as follows in the Section “Interpretation of the different provisions” (the quotation below is provided without the footnotes, which contain references to specific cases):\\n“3. Specific restrictions to the right to strike\\nThe rights and principles set forth in Part I when effectively realised, and their effective exercise as provided for in Part II, shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations not specified in those parts, except such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health, or morals.\\ni. Restrictions related to essential services/sectors\\nProhibiting strikes in sectors which are essential to the community is deemed to serve a legitimate purpose since strikes in these sectors could pose a threat to public interest, national security and/or public health. However, simply banning strikes even in essential sectors – particularly when they are extensively defined, i.e. “energy” or “health” – is not deemed proportionate to the specific requirements of each sector. At most, the introduction of a minimum service requirement in these sectors might be considered in conformity with Article 6 § 4. ...”', '45.  On 22 October 2010 the Committee issued its conclusions (2010/def/UKR) on the situation in Ukraine as regards collective action. The relevant extracts read as follows:\\nArticle 6 - Right to bargain collectivelyParagraph 4 - Collective action\\n“The Committee takes note of the information contained in the report submitted by Ukraine.\\nArticle 44 of the Constitution guarantees workers the right to strike to protect their economic and social interests.\\nIn addition Section 27 of the Law on Trade Unions guarantees the right of trade unions to, inter alia, organise and stage strikes in order to protect workers labour and socioeconomic rights. The Law on the Procedure of settlement of collective disputes contains provisions on the right to strike, including the procedure to be followed prior to exercising the right to strike, etc...\\nSpecific restrictions to the right to strike\\nUnder Article 6 § 4 the right to strike may be restricted provided that any restriction satisfies the conditions laid down in Article G[3] which provides that restrictions on the rights guaranteed by the Charter that are prescribed by law, serve a legitimate purpose and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health or morals.\\nRestrictions related to essential service/sectors\\nThe Committee notes that there are restrictions on the right to strike for workers in the emergency and rescue services, workers at nuclear facilities, workers in underground undertakings as well as workers at electric power engineering enterprises. The Committee recalls that restricting strikes in sectors which are essential to the community is deemed to serve a legitimate purpose since strikes in these sectors could pose a threat to public interest, national security and/or public health. However, simply banning strikes even in essential sectors – particularly when they are extensively defined, is not deemed proportionate to the specific requirements of each sector, but providing for the conformity with Article 6 § 4.\\nTherefore the Committee asks for further information on the extent of the restrictions on the right to strike in these sectors, in particular as regards “underground undertakings”.\\nIn addition the Committee notes that according to the report strikes in the transport sector may be prohibited, inter alia, if the transportation of passengers is affected. The Committee seeks confirmation that this interpretation is correct, in this respect it refers above to its case law mentioned above...”', '46.  The relevant extract of Resolution CM/ResChS(2012)4 on collective complaint No. 32/2005 against Bulgaria reads as follows:\\n“[The Committee finds] that it has not been established that the restriction of the right to strike imposed by Section 51 of the [Railway Transport Act] pursues a legitimate purpose in the meaning of Article G1. The alleged and not further specified consequences for the economy do not qualify as a legitimate aim in this respect. In the absence of a legitimate purpose, the restriction to the right to strike according to Section 51 of the [Railway Transport Act] may not be considered as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of Article G1.”', '47.  The relevant section of the conclusions of 22 October 2010 in respect of Lithuania reads as follows:\\n“Restrictions related to essential services/sectors\\nThe Labour Code provides an obligation to provide minimum services to meet the immediate needs of the community in the event of strikes in undertakings and sectors covered by Article 77.4 of the Labour Code. Such minimum services are determined either by the Government after consultation with the Tripartite Council or by the relevant municipal executive after consultations with the parties to the collective dispute. The undertakings and sectors concerned are the railways and public transport, civil aviation, communications and energy enterprises, health care and pharmaceutical institutions, food, water, sewage and waste disposal enterprises, oil refineries, enterprises with a continuous production cycle and other enterprises where work stoppages would result in grave and hazardous consequences for the community or human life and health.”', '48.  The relevant part of the conclusions of 30 June 2006 in respect of Slovenia reads as follows:\\n“The report ... points out that as regards the sectors of the police force, the defence forces, aviation, customs and railway transport, as well as other activities where a minimum level of the working process is required to be carried out, there have practically been no relevant strikes in recent years since disputes are resolved by negotiations following the prior announcement of a strike.”', '49.  The relevant extracts read as follows (emphasis added):\\n“1. As Europe undergoes rapid political, economic, social and cultural integration – within the European Union and in the wider Council of Europe area – the vulnerability of each country to disruptions in others is becoming increasingly pronounced. This holds also for strike actions in essential services, whether in public or private ownership, such as in the transport sector (especially air transport), or in public health, at a time of intensified international contacts and labour mobility. The wide differences in national legislation and practices between European countries are, against this background, increasingly at variance with the overall state of European integration and prejudicial to it. 2. Of further concern is the lack of balance in many countries between, on the one hand, the right to strike, including in essential services, as enshrined in various treaties from the Council of Europe’s revised European Social Charter (ETS No. 163) to the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, on the other hand, the fundamental right of citizens to pursue their lives unhindered, preserve their health and well-being, and the right of society to function and to maintain its overall ability to function as well as protect the health and welfare of its citizens. In certain European countries, this balance is seriously tilted against citizens and society. 3. The Parliamentary Assembly, against this background, calls on the governments of the member states of the Council of Europe:\\n- to carry out studies on the cost of strikes in essential public services to the national economy, companies and citizens, both directly in the form of lost output and indirectly such as through impaired social relations and harm done to a country’s international reputation, and to collate and compare the results at the level of the Council of Europe;\\n- to intensify research and the exchange of information on laws and regulations in force in different Council of Europe member states as regards the right to strike in essential services or limitations thereto;\\n- to harmonise as far as possible national legislation governing strikes in essential services so that citizens throughout the Council of Europe area can be protected adequately and in a homogeneous manner;\\n- to make the fullest possible use toward this end of the provisions of the revised European Social Charter governing the right to strike and the protection of other social rights of citizens, including in the Charter’s enforcement mechanism;\\n- to encourage similar efforts within the more limited membership of the European Union, via EU legislation capable of subsequently being applied, with the necessary adaptations, in the Council of Europe area as a whole.”'], 'applicants': ['VENIAMIN TYMOSHENKO', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['UKRAINE'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['11', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['11'], 'court_assessment_references': {'11': ['12', '23', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '38', '7']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 6, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 6, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32], 'explained_indices': [5, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 23, 22, 43, 20, 6, 7, 8, 9, 42, 11, 12, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 13, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1], 'explained_distances': [-0.109809965, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.1379362, -0.13814801, -0.35933477, -0.49360013, -0.50896597, -0.57580876], 'number_of_sentences': 44, 'article_id': 1, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Katowice, Poland.', '10.  On 13 November 1981 the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) declared the applicant the sole heir of his mother’s estate. Consequently, he became a co-owner of an apartment building situated in Katowice. The building was owned in equal parts by the applicant and his brother, Mr M. P., who had inherited his share of the property from their father in 1973. It consisted of two separate apartments, a staircase and several rooms situated in the basement and in the attic.', '11.  On 10 January 1983 Mr M.P. instituted non-contentious proceedings (postępowanie nieprocesowe) before the Katowice District Court in which he sought a ruling on how the property should be used by the co-owners.', '12.  The Government averred that the proceedings were stayed between 1 March and 11 November 1983 because the parties had failed to make a downpayment to cover expert fees. The applicant claimed that he had made the required payment on time.', '13.  The Government submitted that before 1 May 1993 the trial court had held fifteen hearings and that the applicant had failed to attend six of them. The applicant contested that submission.', '14.  Before 1 May 1993 the presiding judge on two occasions inspected the property.', '15.  Between 17 August and 7 December 1993 the trial court held five hearings. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to attend three of them and that one of these absences had not been justified. The applicant claimed that he had attended all five hearings.', '16.  During the hearing held on 11 January 1994 the trial court dismissed two requests concerning evidence submitted by the applicant. It also suggested a friendly settlement to the parties, but to no avail.', '17.  On 25 January 1994 the Katowice District Court decided that the applicant should have exclusive access to a room situated in the attic and that he should share a garden with his brother. Both parties appealed to the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) against that decision.', '18.  On 25 October 1994 the Regional Court held the first hearing, which was adjourned because of the applicant’s absence. The applicant submitted that he had not attended the hearing because he had not been served with the summons.', '19.  On 24 November 1994 the Katowice Regional Court quashed the judgment of the District Court except for a part concerning the division of the garden and remitted the case to the first-instance court. The Regional Court considered that the decision to award the applicant exclusive access to a room situated in the attic could lead to further conflicts between the parties. It also pointed out that on several occasions the applicant had changed his claims and that the District Court had failed to take into account certain proposals submitted by the plaintiff in the first-instance proceedings.', '20.  On 28 January 1995 Mr M. P. died and was replaced as a party to the proceedings by his widow, Mrs K. P. and his son, Mr L. P. During the hearing held on 14 March 1995 the District Court stayed the proceedings to allow them to obtain a declaration of heirs. The proceedings were resumed on 21 August 1995.', '21.  The next hearing was held on 19 October 1995. On 13 November 1995 the judge visited the property.', '22.  The Government submitted that during the hearing held on 19 March 1996 the applicant had asked the court to take evidence from two expert witnesses. The applicant disputed that submission.', '23.  Between 1 August and 28 November 1996 the District Court held four hearings. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to attend the first of these hearings. The applicant disagreed with that submission.', '24.  During the hearing held on 4 March 1997 the court allowed the applicant’s request and appointed an expert witness. On 23 December 1997 the witness submitted his report. The Government submitted that a delay in taking evidence from the expert witness resulted from the trial court’s “unsuccessful attempts to find an expert who was able to prepare the opinion”.', '25.  On 10 March and 7 May 1998 the District Court held hearings.', '26.  On 27 May 1998 the presiding judge and the parties visited the property. The applicant refused to sign the record of the survey because he considered that it was not objective.', '27.  The next hearing was held on 16 June 1998. The applicant was absent for health reasons.', '28.  On 19 August 1998 the applicant challenged the presiding judge. On 24 August 1998 the challenge was dismissed by the District Court but the applicant appealed to the Katowice Regional Court.', '29.  On 25 August 1998 the District Court held a hearing. The Government submitted that it had been adjourned since the applicant had failed to attend it and his challenge to the judge had not been decided. The applicant claimed that he had not received the summons for that hearing.', '30.  On 14 October 1998 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed as manifestly ill-founded the applicant’s appeal against the District Court’s decision of 24 August 1998.', '31.  On 16 December 1998 the applicant filed with the Katowice District Court a written statement in which he complained about a delay in the proceedings and submitted several requests concerning evidence.', '32.  On 17 December 1998 and 25 February 1999 the District Court held hearings.', '33.  On 5 March 1999 the President of the Katowice Regional Court responded to the applicant’s complaint of 5 January 1999 about the excessive length of the proceedings in his case. He pointed out that the case involved both legal and factual complexity and that both parties had changed their claims on many occasions. Furthermore, he noted that fifteen hearings had taken place since 24 November 1994. The inspection of the property on 27 May 1998 had been necessary since a new judge had taken over the case and in order to establish the actual condition of the house. The President concluded that in those circumstances the court could not be blamed for the lack of activity in the case.', '34.  On 11 March 1999 the Katowice District Court decided that rooms situated in the attic should be used exclusively by the plaintiffs, whereas a room in the basement should be shared with the applicant. Both parties appealed to the Katowice Regional Court.', '35.

By decision no. 174 of 15 June 1992, the Municipality granted the applicant company planning permission to build five hundred flats. A building permit was also required before the project could start, but the Municipality failed to decide the matter for a considerable length of time, thus preventing the building works from getting under way.', '10.

On 21 October 2004 the applicant requested that the enforcement proceedings, stayed by the Municipal Court, be continued.', '14.  On 9 December 2003 the Commercial Court (“Trgovinski sud”) in Novi Sad ruled in favour of the applicant in another case, ordering the same debtor to pay a total of 2,336,720.80 Serbian Dinars (“CSD”), with interest, plus costs. By 9 January 2004 this judgment became both final and enforceable.', \"15.  Based on the above judgment and in response to the applicant's request of 26 February 2004, on 28 October 2004 the Municipal Court in Bačka Palanka issued an enforcement order against the debtor for the above payment, plus interest as of 18 July 2003, as well as another CSD 172,234.40 for costs together with interest as of 9 January 2004. For this purpose a number of plots deemed to be owned by the debtor were to be evaluated and auctioned, with the applicant's claim being met from the proceeds.\", '16.  On 12 November 2004 the Municipal Court in Bačka Palanka decided to join the two sets of enforcement proceedings.', \"17.  On 1 December 2004 it formally accepted the expert's opinion and valued the land in question.\", '18.  On 13 December 2004 the Municipal Court scheduled a public auction for 2 February 2005.', '19.  On 27 December 2004 the Attorney General (Republički javni pravobranilac) requested, inter alia, that the State itself be allowed to take part in the proceedings, and noted that the auction should only be carried out in respect of the plots which were undisputedly owned by the debtor.', '20.  On 2 February 2005 the auction was postponed by the Municipal Court. It was re-scheduled for 16 February 2005.', '21.  On 16 February 2005 the Attorney General repeated the request of 27 December 2004.', '22.  On 16 February 2005 the auction was postponed and re-scheduled for 23 March 2005.', '23.  On 16 March 2005 the Municipal Court informed the parties that the auction was again postponed for 30 days because the Municipal Public Prosecutor had urged the Chief Public Prosecutor “to file a Request for the Protection of Legality” (zahtev za zaštitu zakonitosti).', \"24.  On 19 August 2005 the Municipal Court accepted the debtor's motion that the value of the land at issue needed to be re-assessed.\", '25.  On 17 March 2006 the Municipal Court held a public auction and recognised the applicant as the new co-owner of a number of plots formerly co-owned by the debtor.', \"26.  Several days later, the applicant's representatives saw these plots and concluded that they were still being used by the debtor.\", \"27.  On 4 April 2006 the Municipal Court ordered that the land be handed over to the applicant and, further, that the applicant's newly acquired ownership be entered in the land register.\", '28.  On 7 April 2006 the Municipal Court rectified a minor textual error in its decision of 4 April 2006.', \"29.  In a separate decision issued on 7 April 2006, the Municipal Court ordered the transfer to the applicant's bank account of the remaining proceeds from its pecuniary claim, and the applicant waived its right to file an appeal against that decision.\", \"30.  Notwithstanding the Municipal Court's decision of 4 April 2006 the debtor refused to provide the applicant with access to and use of the plots of land in question.\", '31.  On 8 May 2006 the applicant filed a civil trespass claim, seeking possession of this land.', '32.  On 15 September 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant, stating that it had no possession to begin with, which is why none could be restored.'], 'applicants': ['ZIT COMPANY'], 'defendants': ['SERBIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', 'P1-1', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1', '6', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '35', '38', '39', '5', '9'], '41': ['27', '30', '31', '32', '38']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 5, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 5, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'explained_indices': [8, 7, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 0, 9, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 14, 17, 16, 15, 27, 13, 12, 11, 10, 18, 28], 'explained_distances': [0.16208225, 0.14746553, 0.13775182, 0.09064329, 0.08419192, 0.08145219, 0.056052566, 0.05494529, 0.019895434, 0.008888245, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627, 0.0036118627], 'number_of_sentences': 29, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 26 February 2005 the Prosecutor's Office of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the Prosecutor's Office”) instituted criminal proceedings into allegations that the applicant, a police officer at the time, had abused his power. The applicant was suspected of having abused his police power which resulted, inter alia, in the ill-treatment of suspects he had been working with and unlawful searches of their homes.\", '7.  On 28 February 2005 the applicant was arrested on this account.', \"8.  On 3 March 2005 the applicant was brought before the Tsentralnyy District Court of Simferopol (“the District Court”) which decided to extend the applicant's detention until 10 March 2005. The District Court also ordered the Prosecutor's Office to find more information on the applicant's personality, his state of health, his role in the alleged crime, so that it could reach a reasoned decision regarding the applicant's further detention.\", \"9.  On 10 March 2005 the District Court extended the applicant's detention for two months, stating that he had been charged with a serious crime and, if at liberty, could impede the investigation. The District Court rejected the applicant's contention that, for health reasons, he could not be detained in custody, noting that the evidence presented in that respect had been unreliable.\", '10.  On 22 March 2005, following an appeal by the applicant, the Court of Appeal of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the Court of Appeal”) upheld the decision of 10 March 2005.', \"11.

On 17 May 2005, having considered an appeal by the applicant against the decision of 26 April 2005, the Court of Appeal rejected it as unsubstantiated. It stated, however, that, under the applicable rules, the applicant's detention could only be extended to 26 June 2005 and therefore amended the decision of 26 April 2005 accordingly.\", \"13.  On 24 June 2005 the Prosecutor's Office referred the case file to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal to determine which trial court would consider the applicant's case.\", '14.

Between 22 March 2005 and 9 July 2006 the applicant was held in the Simferopol Pre-Trial Detention Centre (“the Simferopol SIZO”) and the Feodosiya ITT.', \"24.  The applicant submitted that he had been held with nine or ten other detainees in cell no. 76 at the Simferopol SIZO, which measured 10.8 sq. m. The cell was equipped with nine bunks stacked in three tiers. The toilet was not separated from the living area and provided no privacy. Because the table in the cell was very small, the detainees had to take it in turns to eat. The applicant had to wash his clothes in the cell, because the laundry service only accepted bed sheets. Daily exercise sessions outside the cell lasted only thirty or forty minutes and were organised in the SIZO's roof-covered yards. Those submissions were confirmed by the signatures of the other nine detainees held with the applicant. Despite the fact that the applicant suffered from hypertension, he was not provided with sufficient medical care.\", '25.  The applicant complained to the officials of the Simferopol SIZO about the conditions of his detention, but to no avail.', '26.  In the Feodosiya ITT the applicant was held together with another detainee in a cell which measured 4 sq. m, of which the toilet and the washstand occupied 1.5 sq. m; there were no windows, no table and no chairs, and the ventilation was unsatisfactory. Subsequently, the applicant was moved to a cell measuring 4.8 sq. m, which he shared with five or six other detainees. The toilet was not separated from the living area, which therefore denied any privacy. There was no table and no chair. In support of his submissions the applicant provided statements from eight co-detainees.', '27.  On 8 February 2006 the applicant unsuccessfully complained to the prosecutor supervising detention facilities, alleging that the conditions of his detention in the Feodosiya ITT were unsatisfactory.', '28.  As regards the Simferopol SIZO, the Government submitted that the applicant had been held in cell no. 156, which measured 29.2 sq. m and in which there were between nine and eleven detainees. Subsequently, he had been held in cell no. 76 which measured 12.3 sq. m and in which there were a total of eight detainees.', '29.  The sanitary units were separated from the other area of the cells; the furniture was appropriate; the laundry operated smoothly; the applicant was offered one-hour periods of daily outdoor exercise.

The applicant, Mr İsak Tepe, is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1943 and is at present living in İstanbul (Turkey). At the time of the events giving rise to his application, the applicant was the provincial chairman of a political party, the DEP (Democracy Party), in the province of Bitlis (south‑east Turkey). The application concerns the applicant’s allegations that his son, Mr Ferhat Tepe, was abducted and killed by undercover agents of the State.', '9.  The facts surrounding the death of the applicant’s son are disputed between the parties.', '10.  The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section 1 below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Section 2.', '11.  A summary of the documents submitted by the parties is to be found in Part B. The witness evidence taken by the Court’s delegates at hearings conducted in Ankara is summarised in Part C.', '12.  In the beginning of July 1993, General Korkmaz Tağma, the commander of the Tatvan 6th Armoured Brigade, invited the provincial leaders of all political parties to a meeting at the army barracks. The applicant attended this meeting as the representative of the DEP and spoke in support of the cultural and democratic rights of the Kurdish population in Turkey. During the meeting, General Tağma claimed that there were no Kurds in Turkey and that those who had taken to the mountains were Armenians. He then asked the participants to report to him the names of the people who helped the PKK. The applicant replied to General Tağma that there were Kurds in Turkey as well as Turks and other minorities and that these people should be treated on the basis of equality in a democratic manner. He added that the denial of other people’s existence and the oppression or repression of others would not lead anywhere. General Tağma was furious and wanted to obtain information on the children of the chairmen, for example where they worked and how old they were. He warned the chairmen, including the applicant, that their children would be destroyed if they were not raised as loyal citizens of the State.', '13.  In the afternoon of 10 July 1993 the applicant’s son, Ferhat Tepe, born in 1974 and working as a reporter for the Özgür Gündem newspaper in Bitlis, was taken into police custody. No reasons were given for his arrest. He was released the same day in the afternoon.', '14.  On 28 July 1993 at around 7 p.m., while Ferhat was in the schoolyard of the Şemsi Bitlis primary school, a tall, bearded man who was known in the area to be a policeman, took him by the arm, put him in a car and drove away with him. Their car was followed by a white car, a Renault with the registration number 65 AD 095. There were two persons inside the white Renault, which was seen later that day parked next to Mahallebaşı police station.', '15.  Later on the same day, the applicant learned from İsmetullah Güzelsoy and Adnan Karslıoğlu that two plain-clothes policemen had made enquiries about Ferhat in the building where they lived. He went home in panic and realised that Ferhat was missing.', '16.  On 29 July 1993 at around 6 a.m. the applicant received a phone call from an anonymous person who claimed to be a member of an organisation called the “Ottoman Turkish Revenge Brigade” and said that they were keeping his son as a hostage. The caller said that Ferhat would be killed unless the applicant closed down the DEP’s Bitlis branch, released four French tourists who were in the hands of the PKK and paid one billion Turkish liras (TRL). The applicant said he could close down the Bitlis branch and try to find TRL 1 billion but had no power to secure the release of the French tourists, as he had no connection with the PKK. The caller warned the applicant that his son would be killed if the conditions were not met.', '17.  On the same day at 8 a.m. the applicant went with his wife and daughter to the Bitlis Security Directorate, where he told the director and the provincial governor of his suspicion that Ferhat had been abducted by contra-guerrillas operating within the State security forces. The governor and the director denied the existence of contra-guerrillas in Turkey and affirmed that the State did not commit murder.', '18.  On the same day the applicant applied to the Bitlis Public Prosecutor and asked that his home and office telephones be tapped in order to trace the caller’s number if another call was made. He also requested that all necessary action be taken to rescue his son.', '19.  On 30 July 1993 the applicant sent telegrams to the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and the Governor of the state of emergency region asking for their aid in rescuing his son.', '20.  On 1 August 1993 the applicant and his wife went to Tatvan to talk to General Korkmaz Tağma at the brigade headquarters. They were told that the general was ill and had gone to Antalya. They were received by a colonel and attended a meeting at General Tağma’s office. During this meeting, Mrs Tepe stated that the bloodshed between Turks and Kurds had to stop and that she would sacrifice her son if this were to bring the animosity to an end.\\nDuring the second or the third telephone call, the anonymous caller said that Mrs Tepe had spoken well at General Tağma’s office, which proves that the caller was either present at the meeting or had been informed by someone who had attended the meeting.', '21.  Subsequently, the applicant informed the Security Director that according to Fatih Olcay and Adnan Karslıoğlu, eye-witnesses to Ferhat’s abduction, the people who had taken Ferhat away were policemen. The applicant also said that there was evidence that the white Renault, which had followed the car in which Ferhat Tepe was abducted, belonged to the security forces.', '22.  On 4 August 1993 the applicant received another phone call at around 3 a.m. He immediately alerted the authorities while he was on the phone and asked them to identify the caller’s number. The conversation that followed was recorded. The person on the phone said that the applicant had failed to fulfil their conditions for the release of Ferhat since the DEP branch had not been closed down, and the applicant had failed to pay and had reported everything to the authorities. The caller told the applicant to bring TRL 1 billion to an address in the province of Elazığ. After listening to the recording, the Security Director told the applicant that the State could give him special bank notes, the serial numbers of which had been noted by the police, and told him to come back later for the bank notes. Later on the same day, when the applicant called again, the Director told him that he was having difficulty in obtaining the bank notes.', '23.  On the same day the applicant, together with four policemen and four of his relatives, went to the address in Elazığ indicated by the caller but could not find anyone.', '24.  Still on 4 August 1993, Ferhat’s dead body was found by a civil servant at the Lake Hazar, in Karakem. On the same day the public prosecutor and a medical expert examined the body. The report of their findings concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that there was no need for a systematic autopsy. It also stated that no signs of blows or the use of force on the body or of friction on the wrists and ankles had been detected.', '25.  On 5 August 1993 the applicant, who had not yet been informed of Ferhat’s death, applied to the Public Prosecutor enquiring whether the anonymous caller’s number had been traced. His application remained unanswered.', '26.  On 8 August 1993 the applicant received a third anonymous telephone call in which he was told that Ferhat’s body was at the morgue in Elazığ. Later that day the applicant discovered that the body had been buried on 5 August 1993 in the Elazığ cemetery for persons with no known relatives.', '27.  On 9 August 1993 the applicant identified Ferhat’s body, which had been exhumed by the authorities. In preparation for the funeral ceremony, the applicant washed the body himself in a mosque. He saw that his son’s testicles had been crushed and that there were marks on the arms, ankles, testicles and chest. He observed some cigarette burn marks on the body but no fractures. There were also deep wounds on the wrists and ankles showing that Ferhat had been bound hand and foot. The applicant alleged that, according to the eyewitnesses Mümtaz Çerçel, Ömer Aceban, Bahri Elçi, Miğdat Yaşar, Murat Koparan, Taner Şarlak, Erkan Dağdelen, Urfi Pasin and Rıza Demirtaş, who had been apprehended and questioned at the relevant time in the Diyarbakır Recruitment Office, Ferhat had been held there and tortured by members of the security forces between 28 July and 4 August 1993. Mümtaz Çerçel allegedly gave a statement, but withdrew it after being threatened by the police.', '28.  On 9 August 1993 the Sivrice Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction, referring the investigation file to the Bitlis Public Prosecutor’s office.', '29.  At the funeral procession in Bitlis on 10 August 1993, there was a strong police presence. The police filmed those who attended, checked their identification and arrested fifteen persons. Later on the same day the police searched the applicant’s house.', '30.  On 12 August 1993 the Bitlis Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case to the Elazığ Public Prosecutor.', '31.  On 19 October 1993 the applicant sent a letter to the Committee of the Turkish Parliament on Murders Perpetrated by Unknown Persons, alleging that secret forces within the State security forces had killed his son.', '32.  On 2 November 1993 the applicant filed a petition with the Ministry of Justice, alleging that the abduction and killing of his son had been the acts of State forces and requesting an investigation into the matter.', '33.  On 16 March 1994 the applicant asked the Bitlis Public Prosecutor whether any inquiry into the killing of his son had been initiated. The Public Prosecutor told him there were some obstacles which he had been unable to overcome. On the same day the applicant went to the Bitlis Provincial Security Directorate and asked the assistant director why no investigation had been carried out. The Assistant Director said he did not have to explain anything to the applicant.', '34.  On 28 September 1994 the applicant applied again to the Ministry of Justice asserting that certain State security forces had been responsible for the abduction and death of his son. He requested that his allegations be investigated.', '35.  On 15 November 1994 the Elazığ Chief Public Prosecutor issued a permanent search warrant for the perpetrators of the killing of Ferhat Tepe.', '36.  Following the applicant’s complaints to the authorities, the police took tight security measures. The applicant, his office, his home and the DEP party building were put under constant surveillance. The police filmed the applicant’s colleagues and his fellow-townsmen who came to console him, and checked their identity cards.', '37.  In the meantime, the applicant’s family had been under intense pressure from the State authorities in relation to his political activities, the investigation he had personally carried out into the killing of his son and his application to the European Commission of Human Rights. The applicant’s daughter was remanded in custody in December 1993; his son was remanded in custody in 1994 for four months and is currently being tried for an offence which carries the death sentence; another of the applicant’s daughters was taken into custody in April 1994; four of the applicant’s nephews were remanded in custody in 1994, one of whom is being tried for an offence which carries the death sentence; the applicant’s brother was taken into custody in April 1994 and the applicant’s cousin has been in Elazığ Prison since 1994. On 24 February 1996 the applicant was arrested in Bartın and held in police custody for eight days in Bitlis. During his detention, the police officers asked him why he accused the State and why he had taken his complaints to the European Commission. They further threatened him and said among other things: “We will kill you just as we killed Ferhat. You are complaining to the infidels about our State. Are they the ones who will save you? Well, let them come and save you.” After being released, the applicant was acquitted of the charges by the Diyarbakır State Security Court. On 4 March 1996 the applicant was allegedly taken into custody in Bitlis on charges of aiding the PKK. He was released on an unspecified date after being interrogated.', '38.  On 19 February 1997 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on account of a speech he had made on a private TV channel, where he had alleged that his son had been murdered by the State. The applicant was charged with insulting the security forces. On an unspecified date, the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.', '39.  In 1999 the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terrorist department while entering the HADEP (People’s Democracy Party) party building in the Kadıköy district in Istanbul. He was kept in detention for one day. The police officers insulted him and threatened him with death. One of the police officers said that they would kill him just as they had killed Ferhat. The applicant complained to the Fatih Public Prosecutor in Istanbul, who decided to discontinue the proceedings, as there was no witness to confirm his allegations.', '40.  The applicant’s son Ferhat Tepe had been arrested on two occasions in 1991, as he was suspected of acting as a PKK courier.', '41.  The Government submitted that, according to various witnesses, on 28 July 1993 Ferhat had met someone in the schoolyard and had left with him of his own free will.', '42.  The authorities, at the request of the applicant, tapped the anonymous telephone call on 4 August 1993. Although a raid was carried out at the address mentioned in the telephone conversation, the premises were found to be empty. The authorities of the Ministry of the Interior nevertheless established that the residence searched belonged to reporters from Özgür Gündem in Elazığ and concluded that Ferhat’s killing had been the work of the PKK.', '43.  A report of 24 September 1993 from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a letter of 16 November 1995 from the governor of Bitlis province indicate that the death of the applicant’s son was the work of the PKK.', '44.  In a letter of 10 November 1995 the Chief Public Prosecutor of Elazığ, charged with investigating Ferhat Tepe’s death, informed the Ministry of Justice that there was no indication or record of Ferhat’s having been taken into custody. Moreover, the custody records of the Bitlis Security Directorate contained no mention of him.', '45.  The parties submitted various documents concerning the investigation into the alleged abduction and killing of Ferhat Tepe.', '46.

The applicant was then told to bring TRL 1 billion by 5 p.m. the next day to an address in Elazığ if he did not want his son to be killed. The person in question warned the applicant not to inform the authorities. The applicant’s request to talk to Ferhat was rejected.\\n(iii)  Post-mortem examination and autopsy report of 4 August 1993', '50.  An autopsy was carried out on Ferhat’s body by the public prosecutor, a medical expert and the latter’s assistant in the presence of two witnesses and a clerk. It was observed that rigor mortis had not set in and the body had not yet turned blue, that water spurted out when the chest was pressed, that light violet-coloured cyanosis was perceptible on the ears and the nails of both the hands and the feet as a result of suffocation and that there were no signs of any blow or of the use of force on the body, nor were there any signs of friction on the hands and feet. It was therefore concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that there was no need for a systematic autopsy.\\n(iv)  Photographs of the corpse taken on 4 August 1993', '51.  Nine photographs were submitted to the Court, taken when the body had been pulled out of the lake. No signs of any blows or ill-treatment are visible on the body in these photographs.\\n(v)  Identification report dated 9 August 1993', '52.

The witness stated that on 28 July 1993, at 4 or 4.30 p.m., Mr Karslıoğlu had told him that two police officers had made enquiries about Ferhat. He had told Mr Karslıoğlu that this might have been an investigation in relation to the attack on police buildings which had taken place the previous day. Later that day, at approximately 5 p.m., he had seen Ferhat and had informed him that two police officers had been looking for him. Ferhat had replied to him that he had not done anything wrong.

The driver was bearded and approximately 35-40 years old, while the man sitting next to him was about 25-30. According to the witness, these men could not have been police officers, otherwise he would have recognised them.

Following their detention on remand, the witnesses read in Özgür Gündem that Ferhat Tepe had been killed. They identified him from his photos. They claimed that they were sure that they had seen Ferhat Tepe in the military detention centre in Diyarbakır.\\n(xv)  Letters from the Chief Public Prosecutor of Bitlis to the Central Gendarme Division Command and the Security Directorate in Bitlis, dated 30 July 1993', '62.

In this letter, the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior informed the Foreign Ministry of their conclusion that, having regard to the way in which Ferhat Tepe had been abducted and to the anonymous telephone calls, Ferhat must have been killed by members of the PKK, in a settling of scores within the organisation. They also noted that the allegation that the authorities had failed to respond to the applicant’s request for help was untrue since, following receipt of the applicant’s complaint, an investigation had been started and the photographs of Ferhat Tepe had been distributed to all the provinces and the security units had been alerted.\\n(xix)  The Elazığ Chief Public Prosecutor’s decision of 15 November 1994', '66.

The subject of this letter was Ishak Tepe’s application to the European Commission of Human Rights.

When the applicant had gone to the address accompanied by police officers from the Elazığ Security Directorate, they had not been able to find anyone. Meanwhile, following inquiries made by the Elazığ police, it had been established that the residents at this address were two journalists from Özgür Gündem who had moved out 15 or 20 days before. The police had found the two journalists concerned and had taken statements from them. The governor concluded from these facts that the impugned incident had been a settling of scores within the PKK.\\n(xxiv)  Statements of Taner Şarlak, Murat Koparan and Erkan Dağdelen, dated 26 February 1996, taken by the Public Prosecutor no. 31562 in Hazro', '72.

2000 drafted by Public Prosecutor no. 24705, informing the Elazığ Chief Public Prosecutor that every three months reports on developments in the investigation were received from the Bitlis and Elazığ

Unofficial documents', '76.  The applicant produced press releases concerning the alleged abduction and killing of Ferhat Tepe as well as the general situation in south-east Turkey at the relevant time. It was reported that Ferhat Tepe was the sixth correspondent of Özgür Gündem to be killed since the paper had gone into publication in May 1992. It was also stated that a previously unknown underground organisation calling itself the “Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade” had claimed responsibility for the abduction of Ferhat in a telephone call to his family.', '77.  In a press release issued by Amnesty International on 6 March 1996, calling for urgent action, it was reported that the applicant, Ishak Tepe, had been taken into custody on charges of aiding the PKK. It was claimed that İshak Tepe had met the police officers against whom he had filed an official complaint after the murder of his son and his nephew and that he had been released after being brought before a court in Bitlis on 4 March 1996. Mr Tepe had not been subjected to any form of ill-treatment and had been able to see his wife and his lawyer while in police custody.', '78.  The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, the Court conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. In this respect, three delegates of the Court took oral evidence between 9 and 14 October 2000 from twenty-four witnesses. A further nine witnesses had been summoned but did not appear for various reasons. The evidence given by the witnesses may be summarised as follows.', '79.  The applicant; who is currently living in İstanbul, was the provincial chairman of the DEP in Bitlis in 1993. He was at the same time a building contractor. During the taking of evidence in Ankara, in addition to his submission of the facts, the applicant stated the following.', '80.  At the relevant time, the applicant’s son Ferhat lived with him and helped him at his building site. Ferhat also worked for Özgür Gündem as a provincial reporter. He was not politically active. However, he had been taken into custody on two occasions before his disappearance. His first detention, on charges of aiding and abetting the PKK, took place three or four months before his release on 2 February 1992. The second arrest was probably on 12 July 1993, when he had not been taken into police custody. Ferhat was taken to the police station, where he met a police officer from the anti-terrorist department called Nurhan Şentürk, known as “sakallı” (the bearded one) in Bitlis and bearing the nickname “Hacı”. There were also two other men in the room whom Ferhat had never seen before. Ferhat felt that Hacı had taken him there to show him to these two newcomers. 17 or 18 days later Ferhat was abducted.', '81.  In the morning of 29 July 1993, at 6 a.m., the applicant received an anonymous phone call from a person claiming to belong to an organisation called the “Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade” who declared that they were keeping his son as a hostage. In the applicant’s opinion, the anonymous person on the phone was General Korkmaz Tağma. He recognised the general’s voice from their meeting some 15 to 20 days earlier, when General Tağma had held a meeting with the provincial chairmen of all the political parties.', '82.  Immediately after this call, the applicant and his wife went to the Bitlis Security Directorate where they met the security director, Mr Orhan Ekinci, and the provincial governor of Bitlis, Mr Fethi Tunç. At the latter’s request, the applicant wrote a petition to the administrative authorities and to the public prosecutor complaining that his son had been abducted by contra-guerrillas operating within the State. He asked the authorities to take immediate action to find him. He refrained from naming any suspects at the time, in particular General Korkmaz Tağma, as he hoped to get his son back alive. The chief of police told the applicant that his son had not been taken into custody.', '83.  Later that day the applicant contacted Fatih Olcay, who had witnessed Ferhat’s abduction. Fatih told him that a tall person with a slight beard had held Ferhat by the arm and had taken him away. From his manner and the fact that he was holding a walkie-talkie in his hand, Fatih had deduced that he was a policeman. However, Fatih was unable to repeat these allegations at the police station since he was under pressure.', '84.  A construction worker called Suat also told the applicant that he had seen Ferhat being taken away in a car with the registration number 65 AD 095. The applicant did not see Suat again and later learned that Suat had gone to İstanbul.', '85.  The applicant’s nephew, Safiye Tepe, contacted former PKK members who had later become “confessors” (i.e. persons who cooperate with the authorities after confessing to having been involved with the PKK) for information about this case. One of them, A.İ., stated that General Korkmaz Tağma had ordered the killing of Ferhat. Some police officers and the JITEM (the gendarmes’ intelligence agency), led by Major Cem Ersever and the Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade, were involved in this plot. A warfare specialist, Ahmet Demir, code name “Yeşil” (“the Green”) was at the head of this plot. Another “confessor “called Kenan – code name Cihan – confirmed that General Tağma had been involved in the killing of Ferhat.', '86.  A journalist, Soner Yalçın, published his interviews with Major Cem Ersever, the head of JITEM, who said that Ferhat Tepe and another person had been abducted by Ahmet Demir’s team, who had been assigned to the Diyarbakır-Bitlis-Muş-Bingöl zone. The JITEM headquarters were at the gendarmes’ interrogation centre in Diyarbakır, where Ferhat had been taken and murdered.', '87.  The witness is currently living in Manisa. He was on a visit to Bitlis at the end of July 1993. He stated that in the evening of 28 July 1993, around 5.30 or 6 a.m., he had been playing football in the yard of the Şemsi Bitlis primary school when he had seen Ferhat walk over. He noticed that a young man around the age of 20‑25, who was slightly bearded and dressed in civilian clothes was following Ferhat. They shook hands and walked away arm in arm, like ordinary friends. The witness did not see any cars around. The next day he heard that Ferhat was missing.', '88.  The witness denied the allegation that he had told the applicant about a tall bearded man, known in the area to be a policeman, or that this man had approached Ferhat, taken him by the arm and put him in a car.', '89.  The witness is a practising lawyer in İstanbul. He was the lawyer of Özgür Gündem at the relevant time and became the applicant’s counsel following the killing of his son.', '90.  The witness interviewed Mümtaz Çerçel in the Diyarbakır prison. The latter told him that he had seen Ferhat Tepe (“the journalist”) while being held in custody by the gendarmes. However, Mr Çerçel did not maintain his statement for fear of persecution. He also met Urfi Pasin and Rıza Demirtaş, who mentioned having seen Ferhat Tepe in custody. They were also afraid to testify before the authorities. They told the witness that a person by the name of Çetin Demirhan had also seen Ferhat and had even talked to him. The witness’s attempts to reach Mr Demirhan also failed as the latter was under threat of death because of this incident. The witness has never spoken to Murat Koparan, Taner Şarlak and Erkan Dağdelen. He did not take statements from Bahri Elçi and Migdat Yaşar.', '91.  The witness was the applicant’s business partner at the time. On 28 July 1993 he was told by Adnan Karslıoğlu that two police officers had made enquiries about Ferhat and the applicant. He reported this to Ferhat and asked him not to go anywhere. Ferhat was very calm about it and told him that he would be at home. That was the last time he had seen Ferhat.', '92.  The witness was the provincial commander of the Bitlis Gendarmes Headquarters at the relevant time. He was in charge of security and law-and-order services outside the borders of the municipality. He had no judicial authority. He was not involved in the investigation into the disappearance and murder of Ferhat, as the incident had taken place within the police authority zone. He heard from the intelligence services in the area that Ferhat was suspected at the time of being involved in money laundering business and that he might have been killed by the PKK.', '93.  The above witnesses were all police officers at the time in Bitlis occupying different functions in different departments, namely anti-terrorism, contraband and traffic. None of the witnesses were involved in the investigation into the disappearance and subsequent killing of Ferhat Tepe. Nor did they know of Ferhat, with the exception of Nurhan Şentürk, who said that Bitlis was a small town with a population of 28,000 where everyone knew each other. He had seen Ferhat before 28 July 1993, when the latter had made a statement at the police headquarters. Mr Şentürk did not remember when this statement had been made and what it had been about. However, the statement was sent to the Public Prosecutor, with a note that Ferhat was a PKK sympathiser. Mr Şentürk further stated that he had grown a beard at the time. He also stressed that Ferhat had never been taken into custody.', '94.  Mr Çavdar confirmed that Mr Şentürk’s nickname was “the bearded one”. Mr Pekdaşoğlu was first asked to give an account of what he had been doing on 28 July 1993 three days after the incident. He explained that he used to have a beige car at the time, with the licence plate number 65 DA 092, and that on 28 July 1993 this car had been parked in front of his house. He had not lent it to anyone. Eye-witnesses identified it as not being the vehicle involved in the incident. The car involved in the abduction had been a white Renault Toros.', '95.  The witness was a former member of the PKK, holding a leadership position in the organisation until he was caught on 28 December 1992. Benefiting from the confession law, he became a “confessor” in return for information he gave to the authorities. He was released in mid-1994.', '96.  In or around March 1992 the witness and two other local leaders of the PKK summoned Ferhat Tepe to Germak village in the Bitlis area and questioned him in relation to his activities. Subsequent to a second meeting held on 14 August 1992 in the mountains, in September 1992 Ferhat was sentenced to death on the grounds that he had been the cause of the killing of a female member of the PKK as a result of having had sexual intercourse with her and that he had used money collected for the PKK for his own purposes, i.e. to build a house and to buy a car.', '97.  The witness explained that the PKK carried out death sentences by shooting where security did not pose a problem. Alternatively, other methods were used, such as throwing people down from rocks and strangling or drowning. Subsequent to his arrest, the witness reported to the police that Ferhat was on the list of persons sentenced to death by the PKK. However, he did not know whether Ferhat had been killed by the PKK.', '98.  The witness was the commander of the Diyarbakır provincial gendarmes headquarters from 1992 to 1995. He was in charge of law and order and security in the rural areas within the boundaries of the province of Diyarbakır, which did not include the area around Bitlis. His organisation did not carry out any investigation into Ferhat Tepe’s death. He was asked by the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court whether Ferhat Tepe had been taken into their custody. After examining the custody records and consulting his colleagues in all the gendarmes stations under his command, the witness reported back that no one of that description had been brought to their premises or taken into custody or involved in any incident in their region.', '99.  The witness admitted to mistakes or negligence in the keeping of the custody records at headquarters. He stated that, for security reasons, it was routine practice to blindfold people taken into custody when they arrived at headquarters. The blindfold was taken off once they were inside and, after that, they were never blindfolded. While he was serving in Diyarbakır, the witness heard some rumours about a Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade, but there was never any concrete evidence of the existence of such an organisation.', '100.  The witness had been the head of the interrogation unit composed of ten officers at the Diyarbakır provincial gendarmes headquarters. His recollection of Ferhat Tepe’s death was limited to the question asked by his commander, Mr Eşref Hatipoğlu, namely whether Ferhat had been taken into custody. He consulted the records and told his commander that Ferhat had not been detained.', '101.  The witness was not in charge of keeping the custody records and there was an officer specifically responsible for that duty at the headquarters. He asserted that detainees were never blindfolded during interrogation and that there was never any physical contact between the interrogators and those detained. He denied the suggestion that anybody had been tortured in the interrogation unit, since medical certificates were issued at the end of the custody period. He further stated that, at the relevant time, there had been twenty detention cells. If more than twenty detainees were brought in, they were transferred to other districts and held there until a cell became vacant in Diyarbakır.', '102.  The witness was the Bitlis Security Director in command of a staff of eight hundred people at the relevant time. On 29 July 1993 he was on duty when the applicant, along with his wife and daughter, came to the Bitlis police headquarters to tell him that he feared for the life of his son who had disappeared. The witness reassured the applicant, saying that he had checked with his colleagues that Ferhat had not been taken into their custody. He explained that every morning he received a list of the persons taken into custody by any of the security forces in his zone. This list was drawn up by the provincial police headquarters in the form of a report, listing the incidents of the day in the municipal area. It was then sent to the governor’s office. A similar report was submitted to the governor by the gendarmes responsible for rural areas. There were also daily security meetings held in the province with the Governor, which the witness and Yüksel Özçelik attended.', '103.  The witness assigned a police superintendent to the task of keeping in touch with the Tepe family. Statements were taken from all the persons named by the family. The information regarding the disappearance of Ferhat was communicated by radio and telex to all provinces in Turkey. The witness confirmed that he had been asked by the applicant to trace phone calls, but this procedure had not led anywhere, as in 1993, it was not possible to trace calls made from public telephone booths. Unable to obtain traceable bank notes from the National Police Headquarters owing to bureaucratic obstacles, he could not give cash to the applicant to pay the ransom.', '104.  The witness was the doctor who signed the autopsy report. At the relevant time, he was a general practitioner working at the district health centre in the Sivrice district of Elazığ. He was not a pathologist qualified to conduct autopsies. He had, however, witnessed many autopsies carried out on persons drowned in Lake Hazar. He claimed that there were ten to fifteen drowning incidents per day at the relevant time.', '105.  The witness said he remembered the incident very well. He arrived at the scene of the incident at about 8 a.m. on 4 August 1993. After examining the body, he concluded that it was definitively a case of death by drowning which had occurred within a maximum of four hours. The deceased’s lips were discoloured as though he had been deprived of oxygen and cyanosis had occurred. Rigor mortis had not set in. He could not see any scratches on the body. Nor did he find any fracture or bruising thereon. There was no sign that the deceased had been either in a fight or hit, beaten, pushed, thrown or killed, or that the body had been brought and thrown into the water. However, the witness saw some marks on the neck and diagnosed them as being erythema, an allergic reaction. He did not think it was necessary to note this in the autopsy report. The witness considered it unnecessary to call in a pathologist or to apply to superior authorities for an autopsy, since he had no doubt that it was a case of ordinary drowning.', '106.  The witness found the body on 4 August 1993, at 7.30 a.m. He had gone to the lake early in the morning for fishing. He saw the body half submerged in the water. The body had underpants on. He pulled the body onto the shore and left it right by the edge of the water. He did not notice any particular features on the body, such as bloodstains or marks of any kind. He saw that there were some clothes – trousers and a shirt which had been placed on the shoes – about half a metre from the shore. He then went to a petrol station and called the Sivrice gendarmes station. He stayed on the spot for about an hour and a half and statements were taken from him by the public prosecutor.', '107.  The witness, who signed the autopsy report, was at the time the Sivrice Public Prosecutor in Elazığ. Although it was not the usual practice, he had photographs taken of the body for identification purposes following the post-mortem examination. At the beginning of his testimony, the witness stated that he had not taken any steps to see whether the body he had found matched any person reported as missing. After consulting the doctor and having heard the witnesses, he decided that a systematic autopsy was unnecessary as there was nothing suspicious about the incident and that he had come across similar drowning incidents in the past. However, he had not encountered a case where the identity of the victim was unknown and the identity card missing. Later he said that he had instructed both the gendarmes and the police to investigate whether anyone had reported a relative missing. He had the body sent to the morgue of the Elazığ State Hospital as there was no suitable morgue in Sivrice. He was informed later that the body had been buried because of a technical problem in the morgue. However, he did not know when the body had been buried and who had ordered the burial. He did not know anything about Ferhat Tepe until Ferhat’s cousin, a lawyer, had applied to their office five days after the incident. When the witness learned that the scene of the incident fell within the territorial jurisdiction of Elazığ, he issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on 9 August 1993.\\n(b) Süleyman Tutal', '108.  The witness was the public prosecutor in Elazığ, in charge of the investigation into the death of Ferhat Tepe. In the investigation file and the autopsy report he received, there were no findings indicating that the deceased had been tortured. There was no sign of any ill-treatment on the photographs. In their statements made at the Hozat Public Prosecutor’s office, Mr Murat Koparan, Mr Taner Şarlak and Mr Erkan Dağdelen had denied the allegations contained in the declarations addressed “To the Public”. There was therefore no evidence that Ferhat had been abducted or killed under torture. The witness considered the incident to be a case of ordinary death by drowning and, accordingly, did not deem it necessary to conduct any further investigation.\\n(c) Hayri Özdal', '109.  The witness was the Chief Public Prosecutor in Bitlis at the time of the events. He was on judicial leave from 20 July to 6 September 1993. On 28 September 1993 he was appointed as a judge to a court in İstanbul. He could not contribute to the elucidation of the facts.\\n(d) Erdal Poyraz', '110.  The witness was one of the two Public Prosecutors who were deputies to the Chief Public Prosecutor in Bitlis. He was on duty when the Chief Public Prosecutor was on leave. He issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on 12 August 1993 after the body had been found and sent the preliminary investigation file he had prepared to the Sivrice Chief Public Prosecutor’s office. He said the case had struck him as a unique and unusual one at the time. However, he could not remember whether he had done anything about the case, but said: “I must have started the investigation”.\\n(e) Beytullah Metin', '111.  The witness was a trainee public prosecutor in Ankara in July and August 1993. He did not take part in any investigation concerning Ferhat Tepe.\\n(f) Şükrü Cüneyt Hamdovalı', '112.  The witness was assigned to the Bitlis office as a public prosecutor on 24 February 1993. He was on duty in July and August 1993 along with his colleague, Mr Erdal Poyraz. He confirmed that Mr Poyraz had been in charge of the investigation while he personally had not been involved in it. He did remember, however, that there had been some incidents during the funeral.', '113.  On 20 July 1993 all three witnesses were arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting members of the PKK and taken into custody at the Hazro gendarmes headquarters, where they stayed for two days. The witnesses were then taken to Diyarbakır and kept at the gendarmes headquarters between 22 July and 13 August 1993. On the latter date, the Diyarbakır State Security Court ordered the witnesses’ detention on remand and they were transferred to Diyarbakır E-type Prison. They stayed in the same cell for two months until the State Security Court ordered their release following acquittal.', '114.  The witnesses denied the suggestion that, during their detention, they had seen Ferhat Tepe being tortured or killed. Nor had they known of him or heard of a journalist being detained in the same place with them. As regards the document addressed to the public which they had signed in prison, the witnesses alleged that the persons in the ward who had told them to sign this document had tricked them into it, as it contained statements which they had never uttered. They thought that it was a document prepared for the purposes of their defence in court; they had not read the document before signing it. The witnesses further stressed that they had been very young at the relevant time (16, 20, and 14 years old respectively) and that the persons who had made them sign the document had taken advantage of their youth and inexperience. The witnesses finally claimed that they had learned of the content of the impugned document when the Hazro Public Prosecutor had taken their statements about it on 26 February 1996.'], 'applicants': ['TEPE'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['14', '10', '5', '13', '3', '38', '2', '18', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['2', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['138', '139', '143', '150', '151', '154', '159', '160', '163', '17', '175', '76'], '13': ['176', '177', '178', '179', '180', '181', '182'], '34': ['127', '128', '129', '130', '131', '132', '133', '134', '135']}, 'silver_rationales': [9, 68], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [9, 68], 'explained_indices': [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 37, 84, 52, 51, 50, 49, 88, 43, 44, 55, 42, 89, 90, 45, 56, 83, 58, 91, 82, 81, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 71, 78, 77, 57, 38, 75, 36, 104, 7, 8, 9, 10, 103, 102, 101, 14, 15, 16, 17, 76, 22, 23, 21, 24, 35, 94, 31, 30, 28, 29, 96, 97, 95, 86, 87, 85, 80, 79, 100, 99, 98, 93, 92, 53, 106, 73, 6, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 39, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, 105, 54, 59, 60, 61, 66, 67, 72, 74, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.61742854, 0.5591361, 0.53825754, 0.43778002, 0.38366324, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.3830564, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.38305637, 0.34282115], 'number_of_sentences': 107, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Bucharest.', '6.  Between 1994 and 1996 the applicant, in his capacity as the President of Bank B., facilitated the sponsoring of the Government by the bank in the production of a book promoting the image of Romania abroad. On 14 March 1997 the applicant was dismissed from his job.', '7.  On 24 September 1996 the company O.P. filed a criminal complaint against the applicant, accusing him of abuse of authority (abuz în serviciu, under Article 248 of the Criminal Code) and misappropriation of funds (deturnare de fonduri, under Article 302 of the Criminal Code) in relation to the above-mentioned sponsorship contract.', '8.  On 6 November 1996 the prosecutor attached to the Bucharest District Court took a statement from the applicant in connection with the allegations above.', '9.  On 14 November 1996 the prosecutor decided not to start criminal proceedings as the facts in the case did not disclose the commission of a crime.\\nOn the same date, the applicant was informed of the decision.', '10.  On 26 September 1997 Bank B. filed a criminal complaint against the applicant for fraud (înşelăciune, under Article 215 of the Criminal Code) and abuse of authority (under Article 248 of the Criminal Code) in the handling of the same sponsorship contract mentioned above.', '11.  On 9 January 1998 the applicant made a statement to the prosecutor.', '12.  Witnesses’ and co-defendants’ depositions were taken in November 1996, November and December 1997, January, February, August and December 1998, and March and December 1999.', '13.  On 2 February 1998 a criminal investigation for fraud was started in respect of the applicant.', '14.  On 17 February 1998 the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice enquired about French companies that had been involved in the publication of the book. He asked for evidence to be taken on commission (comisie rogatorie) by the prosecutor attached to the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance. The request was reiterated on 13 October 1998. The documents were received from France on 13 November 1998.', '15.  On 12 October 1998 the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice overturned the prosecutor’s decisions of 14 November 1996 and 2 February 1998. He considered that as long as the decision of 14 November not to prosecute had not been overturned, the prosecutor could not have legally started the criminal prosecution on 2 February. He ordered the opening of a criminal prosecution for fraud through contracts.', '16.  On 3 November 1999 the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice changed the legal classification of the offence from fraud to abuse of authority.', '17.  On 9 December 1999 the applicant was questioned by the prosecutor at the Supreme Court of Justice for the first time in connection with the new classification of the offence. On the same day the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody until 7 January 2000 on the prosecutor’s order.', '18.  On 15 December 1999 the applicant (in the presence of the lawyer of his choice) was informed of the content of his criminal file.', '19.  On 16 December 1999 the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice issued an indictment for abuse of authority.', '20.  The case was registered with the Bucharest County Court. Thirteen hearings took place before this court, from five of which the applicant was absent for medical reasons. On four other occasions the court postponed the oral hearings for various reasons, including requests made by the applicant’s counsel.', '21.  On 27 February 2001 the Bucharest County Court declared null and void the prosecution acts, referred the case back to the prosecutor and ordered him to carry out a complete review of the facts under investigation (refacerea urmăririi penale). Upon an appeal by the prosecutor, in a final decision of 22 May 2001 the Bucharest Court of Appeal considered that only the indictment of 16 December 1999 was null and void and therefore referred the case back to the prosecutor and ordered him to review that act.\\nThe courts found that the prosecutor had not allowed enough time for the applicant to familiarise himself with the prosecution file and to formulate his requests, if any, in connection with it, and that the prosecutor had acted in haste in indicting the applicant only one day after presenting him with the file.', '22.  On 8 January 2002 the applicant made a statement to the prosecutor.', '23.  On 18 April 2002 the prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice decided to end the prosecution against the applicant, on the ground that the legal relationships under examination were of a civil and commercial nature and not of a criminal nature.\\nOn 22 April 2002 he informed the applicant of his decision.', '24.  On 10 December 1999 the applicant contested his detention pending trial. The Bucharest County Court ordered his release on 14 December 1999. However, this decision was overturned by the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a final decision of 28 December 1999. The applicant remained in custody.', '25.  He later requested the Bucharest County Court to revoke the order for his detention. On 7 January 2000 the court ordered his release from custody. The prosecutor appealed and the County Court’s decision was quashed by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 24 January 2000. The applicant’s detention order was extended by thirty days.', '26.  Upon the applicant’s request, the County Court concluded, on 2 February 2000, that his detention order had expired on 7 January. In a final decision of 15 February 2000 the Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the prosecutor.', '27.  Consequently, on 15 February 2000 the applicant was released from custody.', '28.  The applicant brought an action against Bank B. claiming compensation for illegal dismissal. In a final decision of 3 March 2003 the Bucharest County Court awarded the applicant 103,992 United States Dollars (USD) in respect of pecuniary damage (loss of earnings) and USD 33,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage.', '29.  On 9 April 2004 the applicant lodged an action against the State, under Articles 504-505 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings, 998-999 and 1000 § 3 of the Civil Code and the Convention, seeking compensation for unlawful detention. He claimed 10,000,000,000 Old Romanian Lei (ROL) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, of which USD 12,999 represented salaries that he had not received from Bank B. during his arrest.', '30.  On 24 September 2004 the Bucharest County Court allowed the action and granted the applicant ROL 250,000,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. It held:\\n“The evidence in the file confirms the applicant’s right to compensation under Article 504 of the [Code of Criminal Procedure] for his detention...\\nThe applicant’s detention for 30 days on the prosecutor’s order; the detention from 7 January 2000 to 15 February 2000 which, as decided by means of a final decision, contravened the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Constitution, which required that the arrest be ordered by a “judicial officer” and extended by a court...; and lastly, the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution against the plaintiff on the ground that the facts committed did not fall within the scope of the criminal law, required the State’s responsibility for the judicial error made in the case...\\nConcerning the salaries not received during his arrest, ... the court notes that the applicant was released from his position on 14 March 1997, [Bank B.’]s criminal complaint being posterior to his dismissal. Therefore ... the court considers that there is no causal link between the applicant’s arrest and loss of revenue.\\nMoreover, in the Bucharest County Court’s decision of 3 March 2003, ... [which became final], a causal link was established between ... the plaintiff’s dismissal of 14 March 1997, which had not been a consequence of his detention, and the damage incurred, that is, the loss of earnings; this decision awarded compensation for the damage...\\n...[ [U]nlawful arrest and prosecution causes moral, social and professional suffering, and breaches dignity, honour and individual freedom, human rights protected by law. However, the amounts claimed by the plaintiff exceed by far the awards made by the European Court ... for just satisfaction under the ... Convention, the instrument invoked by the plaintiff as the legal basis for his claims.”', '31.  On 12 October 2005 the Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed appeals lodged by the parties, upheld the County Court’s arguments and confirmed that:\\n“The plaintiff’s deprivation of liberty affected his honour and reputation, and the reparation can and must be made by a financial award.”', '32.  In a final decision of 22 February 2007 the High Court of Cassation and Justice (the former Supreme Court of Justice) dismissed for being out of time and ill-founded respectively, appeals on points of law lodged by the applicant and the State.', '33.  On 31 October 2007 the Government informed the Court that the applicant should request the execution of the final decision and communicate to the Ministry of Finance details of a valid bank account where the money could be transferred, but that to date no such steps had been taken by the applicant.', '34.  The newspaper “România Liberă” presented in its 17 March 1997 edition the opinion of various political figures on the applicant’s dismissal and arrest:\\n“The former president of [Bank B.], Răzvan Temeşan, was called on Friday for questioning by the police, informs prosecutor G.M. from the General Prosecutor’s Office. G.M. pointed out that the hearings might continue in the following days.\\nThe Prosecutor’s Office imposed an obligation on Răzvan Temeşan not to leave Bucharest for thirty days. The president of [Bank B.] was accused, in the press, of bad management... S.D., the president of the FPS [the State Property Fund], stated that the members of [Bank B.]’s executive board had been asked on Friday ... to dismiss Răzvan Temeşan ... from his position... C.A., deputy president of the PSDR [the Romanian Social-Democrat Party]: ‘We only comment when we know the exact content of the file. In the case at hand we can only say that, in principle, the investigation of Răzvan Temeşan is part of the general fight against corruption. ... [H]owever, his responsibility shall be determined after investigations by the police and the Prosecutor’s Office...’ H.R., leader of the PL ‘93 [the Liberal Party ‘93]: ‘I believe it is a good thing that the present political power, unlike the former one, is allowing the investigation of fraud in the banking world...’\\nThe Romanian National Bank (BNR) considers that the changes in the administration of [Bank B.] reflect the shareholders’ right, in particular FPS’s right, as the major shareholder, to decide upon the bank’s fate, stated A.V., director for communications of BNR... I.D., president of PNTCD [the Agrarian Party] and CDR [the Romanian Democratic Convention]: ‘The facts surrounding Răzvan Temeşan were predictable. Have you not seen what the press published? Maybe it would have been better not to coincide his dismissal with the start of the criminal investigation by the police and the Prosecutor’s Office. But these authorities know better how to proceed...’”', '35.  On 15 March 1997 the newspaper “Jurnalul Naţional” published an article on the applicant’s dismissal and arrest. The article presented the point of view expressed during a TV show on corruption and organised crime by E.C., the President of Romania at that time. He stated mainly that:\\n“Our objective is to save and protect the Romanian banking system, which needs consolidation. As from next week important action against corruption shall commence...\\nOur decision was to fight corruption from the top to the bottom and the action will continue.”', '36.  On a different occasion E.M. reiterated his intention to have criminal investigations started in relation to all the corruption scandals that had previously only been investigated by the press.', '37.  Other similar positions, as well as interviews with the applicant, were reported in the press.', '38.  On 21 January 2000 the Minister of Justice told the newspaper “Cotidianul” that the courts should be more careful when dealing with requests for release from pre-trial detention and noted that some of the most inappropriate decisions to release individuals from custody had been adopted by the Bucharest County Court.'], 'applicants': ['TEMESAN'], 'defendants': ['ROMANIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['30', '32', '33'], 'X': ['3'], '41': ['28']}, 'silver_rationales': [25, 27, 28], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [25, 27, 28], 'explained_indices': [9, 2, 3, 10, 5, 4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 0, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 16, 20, 19, 18, 17, 32, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 21, 33], 'explained_distances': [0.24615997, 0.21160585, 0.20298278, 0.18502378, 0.18071818, 0.1506151, 0.13612264, 0.11235577, 0.10851008, 0.09358376, 0.07834977, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803, 0.043569803], 'number_of_sentences': 34, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant, a Slovak citizen born in 1921, lived in Košice.', '6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '7.  On 10 December 1991 the applicant filed an action with the District Court in Prešov. He claimed the transfer of ownership of real property under the Land Ownership Act 1991.', '8.  In the course of 1992 the District Court scheduled three hearings and ordered an expert opinion. In 1993 two hearings were held. The District Court obtained an expert opinion. After an inspection of the site, it asked the expert for additional information. The parties submitted their comments on the expert opinions.', '9.  On 21 January 1994 the District Court found that the applicant was the owner of the property in issue. On 15 November 1994 the Regional Court in Košice quashed that judgment.', '10.  In the first half of 1995 the District Court obtained further evidence. It held hearings on 31 July and 16 October 1995. On 19 October 1995 it dismissed the applicant’s action. On 10 June 1996 the Regional Court in Košice quashed that decision as being erroneous.', '11.  After having obtained additional evidence and having scheduled two hearings, the District Court delivered a new judgment on 28 May 1997. It found that the applicant was the owner of the property and decided to determine separately the remaining claim, namely that the defendants should vacate the property.', '12.  On 28 July 1997 the defendants appealed. The file was submitted to the court of appeal on 1 October 1997. On 16 April 1998 the applicant claimed that the first-instance judgment of 28 May 1997 should be rectified.', '13.  On 21 April 1998 the Regional Court in Prešov ordered the District Court to determine, within twenty days, the applicant’s ownership claim in respect of a house which the first-instance judgment did not cover. The District Court determined that issue in the applicant’s favour in a judgment given on 20 May 1998. The defendants appealed. On 27 August 1998 the Regional Court in Prešov confirmed the first-instance decision in respect of the house. It dismissed the applicant’s claim in respect of the remaining real property.', '14.  On 10 November 1998 and 1 December 1998 respectively the applicant and the defendants appealed on points of law. On 30 March 1999 the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court’s above decision dismissing a part of the applicant’s claim.', '15.  One of the defendants died on 1 August 1999. On 20 September 1999 the Regional Court in Prešov held a hearing. On 20 December 1999 it upheld the first-instance decisions of 28 May 1997 and 20 May 1998 by which the ownership right in respect of the real property in issue was transferred to the applicant. On 6 March 2000 one of the defendants filed an appeal on points of law.', '16.  On 6 June 2000 the file was submitted to the Supreme Court. On 15 May 2001 the case was returned to the District Court as the defendants alleged that their names were incorrectly mentioned in the judgments of 20 May 1998 and 20 October 1999. After it had obtained relevant documentary evidence, the District Court concluded that rectification of its judgment was not required. It returned the case to the Supreme Court on 8 July 2002.', '17.  On 28 November 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of the Regional Court of 20 December 1999 to the extent that it concerned the transfer of ownership of a part of the real property. The Supreme Court noted, in particular, that the Regional Court had disregarded, contrary to the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, the legally binding view expressed in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 30 March 1999. On 21 May 2003 the Regional Court in Prešov quashed the corresponding part of the first-instance judgment.', '18.  The file was returned to the District Court on 20 June 2003. It heard four witnesses on 24 November 2003. The parties failed to appear on 12 February 2004. On 5 May 2004 the case was adjourned as the file was with the Constitutional Court. The District Court held three hearings between 14 June 2004 and 15 November 2004.', '19.  On 8 March 2005 the District Court decided to obtain an expert opinion. The expert submitted his opinion on 2 September 2005. On 23 September 2005 the District Court decided on the expert’s fees. On 10 October 2005 the applicant requested that a second expert opinion be obtained. On 11 October 2005 he appealed against the decision on the fees of the expert. The Prešov Regional Court decided on the appeal on 22 May 2006. The decision on the expert’s fees became final on 21 August 2006.', '20.  The case was assigned to a different judge of the District Court on 3 July 2006 and 1 August 2007.', '21.  The proceedings are pending.', '22.  On 8 February 2000 the applicant complained under Article 127 of the Constitution that there had been excessive delays in the above proceedings before the Prešov District Court, the Prešov Regional Court and the Supreme Court.', '23.  On 23 April 2002 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint. As a different constitutional remedy had been available to the applicant at the time when the first-instance and appeal court’s decisions had been given, the Constitutional Court could not, under Article 127 of the Constitution enacted with effect from 1 January 2002, examine the alleged delays in the proceedings before the District Court and the Regional Court which had ended in 1999.', '24.  The Constitutional Court further found that in his submissions the applicant complained of the conduct of the Supreme Court in the proceedings leading to its decision of 30 March 1999. As the proceedings complained of had ended, that part of the application was also manifestly ill-founded.\\nb)  Complaint of 5 May 2002', '25.  On 5 May 2002 the applicant filed a new complaint alleging that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before the Supreme Court concerning the appeal on points of law against the Prešov Regional Court’s judgment of 20 December 1999. The applicant claimed the equivalent of approximately 2,350 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction.', '26.  On 25 September 2002 the Constitutional Court found that the Supreme Court had violated the applicant’s constitutional right to a hearing without unjustified delay. It ordered the Supreme Court to proceed with the case without further delay and to pay 10,000 Slovakian korunas[1] to the applicant as just satisfaction. When awarding the above sum to the applicant the Constitutional Court had regard to the applicant’s argument that the proceedings concerning his action had lasted more than ten years.\\nc)  Complaint of 30 January 2004', '27.  On 30 January 2004 the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court about the overall length of the proceedings concerning his action of 1991. He identified the Prešov District Court, the Košice Regional Court, the Prešov Regional Court and the Supreme Court as the authorities responsible for a violation of his rights under Article 48 (2) of the Constitution and under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The applicant also requested that the District Court, before which the case was pending, should proceed with it without further delay.', '28.  The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint on 10 June 2004. It held that it could not repeatedly examine those parts of the proceedings which were covered by its earlier decisions.', '29.  The Constitutional Court examined the proceedings before the District Court after 30 April 2002 (the date when its decision of 23 April 2002 had become final) and also the proceedings before the Supreme Court after 26 October 2002 (the date on which its decision of 25 September 2002 had become final). It found no unjustified delays in the relevant parts of the proceedings.'], 'applicants': ['BANAS'], 'defendants': ['SLOVAKIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['26'], '41': ['26', '50']}, 'silver_rationales': [21], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [21], 'explained_indices': [10, 8, 9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 18, 22, 21, 20, 19, 17, 12, 15, 14, 13, 23, 11, 16, 24], 'explained_distances': [0.015470326, 0.015024304, 0.01227504, 0.009015024, 0.005792737, 0.0049630404, 0.0032174587, 0.0017034411, 0.0011365414, 0.00028407574, 0.00021702051, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305, -0.00016236305], 'number_of_sentences': 25, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The first and second applicants are a married couple who were born in 1959 and 1966. The third, fourth and fifth applicants are their children, a daughter and two sons who were born in 1991, 1996 and 2007.', '6.  The first four applicants entered the Netherlands on 7 April 1999 and applied for asylum. In the course of the proceedings on this asylum application, the first and second applicants were both interviewed by the Netherlands immigration authorities on, inter alia, their reasons for seeking asylum.', '7.  The first applicant gave the following account to the immigration authorities. He had become a member of the communist People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (“the PDPA”) in 1978. During his studies he had volunteered for guard duties at the PDPA headquarters in Kabul’s fifth district. He had been charged with guarding homes against possible mujahideen attacks and checking traffic at intersections for illegal weapons.', '8.  In order to avoid being sent to the front during his compulsory military service the first applicant had, upon graduating as a construction engineer from the University of Kabul, voluntarily reported for duty in 1982 to the security battalion of the Council of Ministers in Shar-e-Now, a neighbourhood in Kabul. After working there for three days, the first applicant had requested a transfer to Kabul’s Pol-e-Charki prison, where working conditions were better as they were indoors. The first applicant had been stationed in block 3, where political prisoners were detained. With fifteen other colleagues he had been responsible for guarding the block. He had had no contact with the 150 to 200 prisoners for whom he had been responsible. His tasks had comprised cell patrol and occasional transport to hospital of prisoners who had fallen ill. He had never witnessed any ill‑treatment or torture by the Afghan authorities of prisoners in that period. He had only once witnessed the ill-treatment of a prisoner, by a “bashi” (leader).', '9.  After six months the first applicant had applied for a transfer, which had been granted by the deputy head of the Afghan security service Khadimat-e Atal’at-e Dowlati/Wezarat-e Amniyat-e Dowlati (“KhAD/WAD”)[1]. At the end of July 1982 the first applicant had started as a construction engineer within the ranks of KhAD, which position he had held until April 1992, when the mujahideen ended the PDPA’s communist regime in Afghanistan. The first applicant had been employed in the buildings department of the Logistics Directorate of KHAD, which had been renamed Buildings Directorate in 1986. For this department/Directorate the first applicant and his team of 100-200 construction workers had constructed five buildings for KhAD, including an office building for KhAD’s Directorate 1. He had also been responsible for the construction of twenty ammunition depots.', '10.  The first applicant had initially declared to the Netherlands authorities that the highest military rank he had attained was that of lieutenant-colonel, which he later changed to major. He further stated that he had been decorated three times for his achievements.', '11.  The first applicant had also been involved in the distribution of party propaganda, delivered to him by the Political Affairs Department of his Directorate, with which he also had meetings twice a week. In addition, he had organised courses for illiterate labourers.', '12.  After the fall of the PDPA regime in April 1992 the applicants had fled to Mazar-e-Sharif, where the first applicant had continued to work as a construction engineer for the municipality until 1998. On 10 August 1998 – one day after the Taliban had taken control of Mazar-e-Sharif – the applicants’ home had been raided and searched by eight armed Taliban fighters, who had found, inter alia, the first applicant’s PDPA identity card, some of his medals, and a bayonet. On the suspicion that the applicants had been keeping weapons in their home, the Taliban had arrested the first applicant and his brother.', '13.  The first applicant had been incarcerated for about seven months and had been questioned several times, during which he had disclosed in detail his past career in the KhAD/WAD. A nephew or cousin of the first applicant had bribed the Taliban commander concerned in order to obtain the applicant’s release, which had been successful but on condition that the first applicant left Afghanistan immediately. On the evening of his release, he was supposed to be executed. A number of his fellow detainees had indeed been executed, and according to the records, so was he – it was only because of the deal that had been struck with the commander that he had been secretly led away.', '14.  The first applicant further told the immigration authorities that he had heard from one of his relatives in Canada that another nephew or cousin, who had also been a member of the PDPA, had been killed in Kabul in 2005 by soldiers of the Ministry of the Interior who were mujahideen or Taliban.', '15.  In support of her request for asylum, the second applicant submitted the following account. She had studied educational theory in Kabul, after which she had been employed as a teacher at a high school in Kabul from 1989 to 1991. She had joined the women’s organisation of the PDPA at the same time as taking up her duties as a teacher. She had stopped working when her first child was born. Out of fear of the mujahideen she had refrained from seeking employment during the time the family lived in Mazar-e-Sharif. She had once been beaten on the street for wearing a burka that was judged too short. This had occurred at the time her husband was incarcerated by the Taliban. According to the second applicant, her husband had been ill-treated and subjected to forced labour during his incarceration.', '16.  After the first applicant had been interviewed on his asylum application, on 12 April and 25 November 1999 and 26 September 2000, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) issued on 9 October 2001 a notice of her intention (voornemen) to reject the first applicant’s asylum application and to hold Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention against him. The applicant’s asylum claim had been considered in the light of, inter alia, an official report (ambtsbericht), drawn up on 29 February 2000 by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs on “Security Services in Communist Afghanistan (1978-1992), AGSA, KAM, KhAD and WAD” (“Veiligheidsdiensten in communistisch Afghanistan (1978-1992), AGSA, KAM, KhAD en WAD”; DPC/AM 663896) and concerning in particular the question whether, and if so which, former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations. On the basis of this report, the Netherlands immigration authorities had adopted the position that Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention could be held against virtually every Afghan asylum seeker who, with the rank of third lieutenant or higher, had worked during the communist regime for the KhAD or its successor the WAD. In the notice of intent, the Deputy Minister analysed, on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international materials, the nature of the acts imputed to the first applicant in the framework of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention as well as his individual responsibility under that Convention.', '17.  Having regard to the official country report of 29 February 2000 as well as documentation from public international sources such as the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the Deputy Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the KhAD/WAD, its lawless methods, the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations, and the “climate of terror” which it had spread throughout the whole of Afghan society. The Deputy Minister considered that this “climate of terror” was also felt within the KhAD/WAD itself. Staff members needed to prove their loyalty to the organisation on an almost daily basis, and a failure to do so put them at risk of being removed from the KhAD/WAD; often this entailed death for the person concerned.', '18.  The Deputy Minister was of the opinion that the first applicant must have known of the criminal nature of the methods employed by the organisation where he had made a career. Furthermore, relying on the official report of 29 February 2000, the Deputy Minister excluded the possibility that the first applicant had remained ignorant of the cruel working methods of the KhAD/WAD. She also did not attach credence to the first applicant’s statement that he had not known of any atrocities committed in Pol-e-Charki Prison, where he had performed guard duty for six months. On this point, the Deputy Minister referred to a 1979 report from Amnesty International as well as to reports drawn up by the United States Department of State on this prison, from which it was obvious that Pol-e-Charki was widely associated with heinous crimes.', '19.  The Deputy Minister noted in this respect that the first applicant had initially declared that he had witnessed the ill-treatment of a prisoner by an assistant interrogator. No value was attached to the fact that the first applicant had subsequently corrected this initial statement and had submitted that this had concerned an incident amongst detainees. The Deputy Minister considered that the first applicant had had every reason to change his statements into more favourable ones once he learned of the investigation against him to assess whether Article 1F of the Refugee Convention applied to him. The Deputy Minister also noted that the first applicant’s initial statements had been very detailed.', '20.  The Deputy Minister further noted that the first applicant had been granted permission, after six months of working as a guard in Pol-e-Charki Prison, to be transferred to a department more suited to his professional profile. According to the Deputy Minister, this meant that the first applicant’s loyalty must have been found proven beyond any doubt, considering that he had been given his position with the KhAD after only a relatively short time in Pol-e-Charki, that the new position opened up opportunities to be promoted to (senior) officer, and that it enabled the first applicant to enter and study several if not many of the KhAD’s buildings. The Deputy Minister concluded that there were serious reasons for considering that the first applicant had committed human rights violations, at least during his time in Pol-e-Charki Prison.', '21.  Taking into account, inter alia, an anonymised official report drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 15 September 1999 (DPC/AM 648554), the Deputy Minister further found it highly implausible that during his ten years of experience as a construction engineer for the KhAD/WAD the first applicant would not have become aware of certain uses for which KhAD/WAD’s buildings had been designed, or at least of to what use they had de facto been put. As torture was systemic in KhAD/WAD interrogation centres, it should be considered impossible that persons belonging to the higher management of the KhAD/WAD had not been involved in this or would have been unaware of it. By reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel the first applicant had entered the higher echelons of the KhAD/WAD. Further taking into account that the first applicant had been decorated for his achievements and that he had continued performing his duties until the fall of the communist regime, the Deputy Minister reached the conclusion that the first applicant’s competence and loyalty must have been beyond doubt. Furthermore, due to the applicant’s involvement with the Political Affairs Department, the Deputy Minister concluded that the first applicant must have been aware of human rights violations being committed. With reference to anonymised official reports of 15 December 2000 (DPC/AM 635082) and 20 February 2001 (DPC/AM 699244) drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Minister considered as regards the political affairs departments that, in the relevant part, their main task had been to guarantee continued loyalty to the Afghan communist regime by means of the reporting of dubious behaviour of individuals to the KhAD/WAD. Political affairs departments cooperated closely with the KhAD/WAD in providing them with information.', '22.  These considerations led the Deputy Minister to conclude that the first applicant’s personal participation in the human rights violations attributed to KhAD was an established fact. Considering the reputation of Pol-e-Charki Prison and the first applicant’s denial of any human rights violations, the Deputy Minister could not attach any credence to the first applicant’s statements. She found that the first applicant had failed in making plausible (aannemelijk maken) – on the basis of objective sources or any other means – his stated ignorance of human rights violations by the KhAD/WAD. In terms of the first applicant’s activities for the KhAD/WAD, the Deputy Minister considered that the first applicant had, for a long time, been of service, albeit in an accessory capacity, to the KhAD/WAD, and that it would thus not have been able to perform its tasks without the first applicant’s efforts. The Deputy Minister also found that the first applicant had supported the activities of the Political Affairs Department; although this department had not committed any atrocities itself, it had been an important element in the State apparatus.', '23.  The first applicant submitted written comments (zienswijze) on the notice of intent on 7 and 20 November 2001.', '24.  On 20 February 2002, the Deputy Minister rejected the first applicant’s asylum application, confirming the reasoning as set out in her notice of intention of 9 October 2001 and rebutting the first applicant’s written comments. Disagreeing with the first applicant, she considered that the official report of 29 February 2000 (see paragraph 17 above) which to a great extent lay at the basis of her decision, could not be seen as an isolated document, but rather as the product of thorough research based on objective sources. The Deputy Minister attached more credence to the report than the first applicant’s unfounded rebuttals.', '25.  The Deputy Minister further dismissed the first applicant’s argument that he had been too remotely connected to the human rights violations attributed to specific departments of the KhAD/WAD during his time as an engineer in that organisation. Relying on UNHCR’s “The Exclusion Clauses: Guidelines on their Application” of December 1996 (see paragraph 71 below) and the official report of 29 February 2000, it was held in this respect that merely supporting an organisation like the KhAD/WAD may in itself suffice to render applicable Article 1F of the Refugee Convention.', '26.  The first applicant’s appeal to the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague sitting in Alkmaar was rejected on 26 February 2004. The Regional Court analysed the first applicant’s accountability for the impugned human rights violations on the basis of the prescribed and so-called “personal and knowing participation” test.', '27.  As regards the “knowing” element, the Regional Court held that the Deputy Minister had not erred in imputing knowledge of the human rights violations committed by KhAD/WAD to the first applicant in the way she had. In this context the Regional Court found that the official reports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which lay to a great extent at the basis of the Minister’s decision, had been drafted in an unbiased manner, were accurate and objective, and provided the required insight in the relevant information, and therefore that the Minister had been entitled to rely on them. It further found that the first applicant had failed to furnish adequate evidence in support of his allegation that the official report of 29 February 2000 was inaccurate and that it could not be assumed that he had knowledge of the human rights violations committed in Pol-e-Charki Prison.', '28.  As regards the first applicant’s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to the KhAD/WAD, the Regional Court reiterated that according to codified policy – the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (Vreemdelingencirculaire 2000) – this notion included, besides personal commission of the impugned human rights violations by the person concerned, the facilitation of the said crimes. Facilitation was defined as a substantial positive effect by means of the person’s conduct on how these crimes had been committed, or a lack of such conduct in preventing these crimes from being committed. The Regional Court found that the first applicant had facilitated the human rights violations committed by the KhAD/WAD by having voluntarily chosen to work as a guard in Pol‑e‑Charki Prison and his subsequent request – also made voluntarily – to start working for the KhAD/WAD. In these circumstances the Regional Court concluded that the first applicant had facilitated – and thus personally participated in – the human rights violations attributed to the KhAD/WAD, despite his having been stationed in Pol-e-Charki Prison as a conscript rather than as a professional soldier.', '29.  Considering that Article 3 of the Convention did not guarantee a right of residence, the Regional Court also dismissed the first applicant’s argument that the Deputy Minister had erred by not examining his asylum account under that provision.', '30.  The first applicant lodged a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State), which quashed the Regional Court’s judgment on 26 July 2004.  As regards the Regional Court’s finding in relation to Article 3 of the Convention, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division held that the Deputy Minister should, wherever possible, avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker is refused a residence permit but cannot be expelled to his/her country of origin for reasons based on Article 3. For that reason, the decision should demonstrate that the Deputy Minister had examined whether Article 3 would lastingly (duurzaam) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned. This, the Division found, the Deputy Minister had failed to do in the present case, for which reason it quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case to the Deputy Minister’s successor, the Minister for Immigration and Integration (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie) for a fresh decision.', '31.  The first applicant was once more interviewed by the immigration authorities on 10 March 2005, after which, on 3 August 2005, the Minister issued the first applicant with a notice of her intention to reject his asylum application. The Minister reached the same conclusions, based in the relevant part on the same grounds, as the Deputy Minister had reached in her notice of intent of 9 October 2001 and subsequent decision of 20 February 2002 in relation to the first applicant’s knowing and personal participation in human rights violations attributed to his former employer – the KhAD/WAD – and consequent application of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention against him. The Minister to a large extent used as a basis for her notice a book by a Professor Dr. M. Osman Rostar entitled “The Pulicharki Prison. A Communist Inferno in Afghanistan”. Prof. Rostar had been detained in Pol-e-Charki Prison for a considerable time during the period between 1981 and 1986-87.', '32.  As to Article 3 of the Convention, the Minister considered, in so far as relevant, that the first applicant had not furnished the required substantial grounds in support of a stated real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in case of his expulsion to Afghanistan. The first applicant’s fear of the mujahideen, the Taliban and/or other armed groups not belonging to the Government persecuting the intellectual classes in Afghanistan, based on the first applicant’s background as a former PDPA member and former employee of the KhAD/WAD, was dismissed by the Minister as based on mere suspicions. The Minister noted in this regard that the first applicant had declared, during the interview held with him on 10 March 2005, that he did not know of anyone specifically looking for him. It was further held that the killing of the first applicant’s nephew or cousin by Afghan State agents because of his past support of the communist regime did not constitute an individual fact or circumstance relevant to the first applicant’s claim under Article 3 and that, furthermore, the source of the said information – a relative of the first applicant residing in Canada – was unreliable.', '33.  The Minister made reference to an official report drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in January 2005, according to which former Afghan communists and those associated with the communist regime, including former KhAD/WAD personnel, possibly ran a risk of human rights violations in Afghanistan. She stressed, however, that this did not mean that every person meeting these criteria would run a risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention upon his/her return to Afghanistan. The Minister underlined in this regard the fact that until 1998 the first applicant had not experienced any problems caused by his membership of the PDPA, his past activities for the KhAD/WAD, or his political convictions after the fall of the communist regime in 1992. The first applicant’s argument that he would run a greater risk of kidnappings and robberies due to his fellow countrymen’s perception of him as a rich person upon his return to Afghanistan was dismissed as unfounded.', '34.  The first applicant submitted written comments on the notice of intent on 26 August 2005. By a decision of 2 December 2005, the Minister once more rejected his asylum application. The Minister fully endorsed the reasons for the rejection as set out in the notice of intent and, in addition thereto dismissing the first applicant’s written comments held, in the relevant part, the following.', '35.  The first applicant had, inter alia, argued that block 3 of Pol‑e‑Charki Prison, where he had worked, had not fallen under the responsibility of the KhAD/WAD and had been located in a separate building, hence away from the human rights violations allegedly committed in blocks 1 and 2. The first applicant had relied on an Amnesty International report in this regard. The Minister held that no support for such a distinction between blocks 1 and 2 on the one hand and block 3 on the other in terms of the commission of human rights violations could be found in the literature and reports written about Pol-e-Charki Prison. The first applicant also, unsuccessfully, advanced a number of inconsistencies in the book by Prof. Rostar.', '36.  With reference to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of 29 February 2000, the Minister dismissed the first applicant’s claim that he had not been involved in human rights violations committed by the KhAD/WAD, having regard to his position as a construction engineer in the said organisation. It was found that all officers of the KhAD/WAD had been involved in its more sinister departments and hence were responsible for the interrogation, torture and execution of suspects. The Minister further considered that, pursuant to the case-law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, she was entitled to rely on the official report as accurate and complete, and that this was not altered by the fact that other reports did not confirm certain findings reached in the official report.', '37.  As regards Article 3 of the Convention, the first applicant had argued that when the Minister had held that the applicants had not experienced any problems in Afghanistan between 1992 and 1998, she had failed to acknowledge that the applicants had been living in Mazar-e-Sharif, which had been a safe haven for former communists during that particular period of time. According to the first applicant, the Minister had also failed to acknowledge that he had experienced problems in 1998. He had further submitted that his brother had held a high position during the communist regime. The Minister, however, considered that none of these arguments constituted concrete and individual circumstances justifying the acceptance of the existence of a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 upon the first applicant’s return to Afghanistan.', '38.  The first applicant’s appeal was rejected by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch by judgment of 19 October 2006. Limiting itself to an analysis of the matter under Article 3 of the Convention, the Regional Court held that the first applicant had not sufficiently established that as a result of his membership of the PDPA and past activities for KhAD/WAD he would run a real and serious risk of treatment contrary to the said provision upon his return to Afghanistan. The court underlined that the first applicant had declared, in an interview held with the immigration authorities on 10 March 2005, that nobody in Afghanistan was specifically looking for him. Although the first applicant claimed that he had been detained by the Taliban in the past, it had not been established that the Taliban would still be looking for him or that he had remained an object of the Taliban’s negative attention. The Regional Court emphasised in this regard that the first applicant’s detention had taken place during a different political situation.', '39.  While the Regional Court accepted that, as set out in an official report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of January 2005, individuals associated with the former Afghan communist regime, including the KhAD/WAD, ran a possible risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention upon their return to that country, it held that this did not mean that everyone associated with the former regime ran a real and serious risk of that nature. The Regional Court noted that the first applicant’s former position in KhAD/WAD could not be regarded as one of the high posts mentioned in this official report. The killing of the first applicant’s nephew or cousin and that the second applicant would have had a western lifestyle did not alter the Regional Court’s finding either.', '40.  The applicant’s further appeal was rejected on 27 April 2007 by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division on summary reasoning. It found that the further appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling and that having regard to section 91 § 2 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), no further reasoning was called for, as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring determination in the interest of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against this ruling.', '41.  On 27 August 2007 the Deputy Minister of Justice issued a notice of intention to declare the first applicant an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order (ongewenstverklaring) in accordance with article 67 § 1 (e) of the Aliens Act 2000, following the decision to hold Article 1F of the 1951 Convention against him in the asylum procedure. This intention was not followed by an actual decision to impose an exclusion order.', '42.  The second applicant was interviewed by the immigration authorities on 12 April and 25 November 1999. On 10 October 2001 the Deputy Minister issued a notice of her intention to reject the second, third and fourth applicant’s asylum application. The latter two applicants, being minors, were included in the second applicant’s application for asylum throughout the proceedings. In so far as relevant, it was held that the second applicant’s motives for asylum were to a large extent dependent on the first applicant’s motives. The first applicant’s application having been rejected, the Deputy Minister considered that the second applicant’s asylum claims were to be assessed on their own merits.', '43.  Referring to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of 16 September 1999, the Deputy Minister held that there was no general rule for assessing the risk which family members of individuals sought by the Taliban might run in Afghanistan. As a rule of thumb, it could be assumed that such family members would only risk being detained by the Taliban as a means of forcing the person concerned to report to the authorities if that person was present in Afghanistan, or was at least suspected to be. Even if it was to be assumed that the first applicant was being sought by the Taliban, he had not been in Afghanistan since March 1999 and, by his own admission, was even believed by the Taliban to have been executed. It was unlikely, therefore, that the second applicant would attract the Taliban’s attention on account of her husband’s activities.', '44.  As regards the second applicant’s claim that she had been threatened by the Taliban during the search of the family house in Mazar-e-Sharif, the Deputy Minister considered that any threats uttered had rather been directed at the two men – the first applicant and his brother – than at the women present. While it was regrettable that the second applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment after her burka had been judged to be of insufficient length, the Deputy Minister noted that this had been a single occurrence and that there were no indications that the Taliban continued to have an interest in her.', '45.  As regards Article 3 of the Convention the Deputy Minister considered that the second applicant had not advanced the required substantial grounds for believing that she would run a foreseeable, real and personal risk of treatment contrary to said provision. The single incident about the burka was insufficient for the second applicant to be able to rely on Article 3 successfully. In this respect the Deputy Minister also had regard to the fact that the second applicant had lived under Taliban rule for a relatively long period of time, but other than the aforementioned incident she had not reported any further occurrences relevant in terms of Article 3 of the Convention.', '46.  The Deputy Minister, furthermore, considered that the second applicant was to be excluded from the so-called “policy of protection for certain categories” (categoriaal beschermingsbeleid), in force for Afghan nationals at that time. The Deputy Minister considered in this regard that the rejection of the asylum application of the second applicant’s husband on the basis of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention gave rise to a contraindication against the issuing of residence permits to his relatives, since the admittance of the second applicant and the applicants’ children would in all likelihood bring about a protracted de facto stay in the Netherlands of the second applicant’s husband.', '47.  The second applicant submitted written comments on the Deputy Minister’s notice of intent on 7 November 2001. She was once more interviewed by the immigration authorities on 13 December 2002.', '48.  On 28 February 2003 the Minister for Immigration and Integration, the successor to the Deputy Minister, issued a fresh notice of his intention to reject the second applicant’s asylum application, due to a relevant change of circumstances in Afghanistan.', '49.  While endorsing the Deputy Minister’s finding as to the existence of a contraindication against the second applicant, the Minister went on to consider that, pursuant to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official report of 19 August 2002, the general situation in Afghanistan no longer required the keeping in place of a categorial protection policy. Moreover, after the fall of the Taliban regime, the second applicant no longer had a reason to fear persecution at their hands, and – as also appeared from the official report of 19 August 2002 – the position of women in Afghan society had greatly improved. In this latter context, the Minister considered that gender in itself was not a conclusive factor in an assessment of the risk of persecution in Afghanistan. It was for the second applicant to make a plausible case for believing that she had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of her personal circumstances, seen against the background of the general situation in Afghanistan. It was found that she had failed to do so. In this context, the Minister held that the second applicant had always lived in major cities in Afghanistan, where the situation for women had improved, as opposed to the situation in the countryside. The Minister saw no reason to assume that the second applicant, if expelled to Afghanistan, would not again settle in a major city.', '50.  The Minister further considered that the second applicant’s membership of the women’s organisation of the PDPA, her husband’s membership of the PDPA, or his past activities for KhAD/WAD were not reason enough in themselves to grant the second applicant asylum, since according to the aforementioned official report there were no indications that people had to fear persecution in Afghanistan for the sole reason that they had previously had ties to the communist regime.', '51.  After receiving the second applicant’s comments on this notice of intent, the Minister rejected the asylum application on 3 March 2004, adding that as the second applicant had not demonstrated that she was or had ever been the object of negative attention from the side of either the mujahideen or the Taliban, she had failed to establish that she would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in Afghanistan.', '52.  The second applicant’s appeal was rejected on 17 October 2006 by the Regional Court of the Hague sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. It agreed with the Minister that the second applicant had failed to establish a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if she was returned to Afghanistan. Her further appeal to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division was rejected on 27 April 2007 on summary reasoning. No further appeal lay against this ruling.', '53.  On 26 July 2007 the fifth applicant was born in the Netherlands to the first and second applicant.', '54.  On 24 April 2009, the first applicant submitted a fresh application for asylum and was interviewed on this new request on the same day. Following a notice of intention notified on 28 October 2009, this application was rejected by the Deputy Minister of Justice, again holding Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention against the first applicant. This decision became final after the Regional Court of The Hague had rejected the first applicant’s appeal on 4 March 2011, entailing that the first applicant was under an obligation to leave the Netherlands.', '55.  On 26 November 2012, the Deputy Minister for Security and Justice, noting that the first applicant had not left the Netherlands and cancelling the intention of 27 August 2007 (see paragraph 41 above), issued a notice of intention to impose an entry ban (inreisverbod) for ten years on the first applicant. No information has been submitted whether this intention has been followed by an actual decision to impose an entry ban.', '56.  On 3 July 2009, also the second applicant had made a fresh asylum application, also on behalf of her minor children, namely the fourth and fifth applicants. Following a successful appeal to the Regional Court of The Hague against the initial refusal of this request and on the basis of a new policy having entered into force on 3 May 2011 (WBV 2011/5; see paragraph 64 below), the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Asylum Policy (Minister voor Immigratie en Asiel) granted on 30 September 2011 the second, fourth and fifth applicant temporary residence permit for asylum purposes (verblijfsvergunning asiel voor bepaalde tijd), valid from 3 May 2011 until 3 May 2016. In the letter of 30 September 2011 notifying this decision, the Minister stated in respect of the adult son (the third applicant) that, in so far as he wished to apply for asylum in reliance on the new policy (WBV 2011/5) that there existed a contraindication, namely his criminal record in the Netherlands, which would be taken into account in the examination of a possible future application.', '57.  Also on 3 July 2009, the third applicant, who had come of age, had made an asylum application on his own behalf which was rejected on 16 December 2009 by the Minister, who found that, given that he had been convicted twice in the Netherlands of acts of public violence, the third applicant presented a danger to public order. The Minister rejected the third applicant’s argument that, being a westernised young man and given the deteriorated general security situation in Afghanistan, he would be exposed to a risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if removed to Afghanistan. In so far as the third applicant relied on Article 8 of the Convention, the Minister considered that it was open for the third applicant to apply for a residence permit on that basis. The third applicant’s appeal against this decision was rejected on 4 March 2011 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. No information has been submitted as to whether he has sought to challenge the judgment of 4 March 2011 by lodging a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division.', '58.  On 5 December 2011, the third applicant made another asylum application, which was rejected by the Minister on 19 December 2011. The third applicant’s appeal and accompanying request for a provisional measure were rejected on 9 January 2012 by the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Zutphen. To the extent that it was accepted that the fresh application was based on relevant newly emerged facts and circumstances (“nova”) warranting reconsideration of the initial rejection as required by section 4:6 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht), the provisional-measures judge did not find that the third applicant qualified for asylum on the basis of the alleged deterioration in the general security situation in Afghanistan or that, for this reason, he would be exposed to a real risk of treatment prohibited by Article 3 if he were removed to Afghanistan. The provisional-measures judge also accepted the Minister’s decision, given the third applicant’s criminal record, not to grant him a temporary residence permit for asylum purposes on the basis of the Minister’s decision of 30 September 2011 to grant such a permit to the second, fourth and fifth applicant under the new policy which had entered into force on 3 May 2011. In so far as the applicant relied on Article 8 of the Convention the judge considered that given the strict separation in the system under the Aliens Act 2000 between an asylum-based application for a residence permit and a regular application (reguliere aanvraag) for a residence permit, it was considered that, if the applicant wished to reside in the Netherlands on the basis of his family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, he should make a regular application for a residence permit based on his rights under Article 8. The provisional‑measures judge lastly noted that, in the event that the Netherlands authorities proceeded with the third applicant’s removal from the Netherlands, he could avail himself of legal remedies to challenge this. There is no indication in the case file that the third applicant availed himself of the opportunity to lodge a further appeal against this judgment with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division.', '59.  On 15 February 2012, the third applicant made a regular application for a residence permit on the basis of his family life with his parents and siblings in the Netherlands. This application was rejected by the Minister on 28 September 2012. The Minister noted at the outset that the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf). Such a visa entitles the holder to enter the Netherlands in order to apply for a residence permit for a stay exceeding three months. The Minister further noted that the third applicant did not fall within one of the defined categories of persons who are exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. As to the third applicant’s reliance on Article 8 of the Convention, the Minister noted that his mother and two younger siblings held a temporary residence permit for asylum purposes and that his father held no residence permit. Although the Minister accepted that there was family life between the third applicant and each of his parents and his siblings, and that there were objective obstacles to the exercise of family life between the third applicant and his mother and siblings outside the Netherlands, the Minister did not find that there was a positive obligation under Article 8 to grant the third applicant a residence permit on that basis. In reaching this finding, the Minister considered that a balance had to be struck between, on the one hand, the applicant’s personal interests and, on the other, public interest considerations. The presence of an objective obstacle was a weighty but not necessarily a decisive factor in this balancing exercise, which also includes other factors such as the way in which family life was conducted in the country of origin, whether the minimum income requirements under the applicable immigration rules were met, public order considerations, and the situation in the country of origin. Noting that his father had been refused asylum because Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention had been held against him, and that no obstacle based on Article 3 for his removal to Afghanistan had been found in the asylum proceedings, that the third applicant had been denied asylum on account of his criminal convictions in the Netherlands, that the third applicant was an adult, and that his submissions did not disclose that there would be “more than normal emotional ties” between his and his mother and siblings, that his mother and siblings lived separately from his father, and that the third applicant himself lived a wandering existence, staying occasionally with his mother and often with friends, and that also his ties with his father did not go beyond the normal ties between a parent and an adult son, the Minister concluded, in particular having regard to the third applicant’s criminal record in the Netherlands, that public interest considerations outweighed the third applicant’s personal interests. This decision also constituted a return decision (terugkeerbesluit). The third applicant was informed that he was now under the obligation to leave the Netherlands within twenty-four hours, failing which he would be eligible for removal, and that the submission of an objection (bezwaar) to the decision would not have any suspensive effect.', '60.  The third applicant submitted an objection to this decision to the Minister and requested the Regional Court of The Hague to issue a provisional measure allowing him to await the outcome of the objection proceedings in the Netherlands.', '61.  On 4 February 2012, the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Utrecht granted the third applicant’s request for a provisional measure, finding that it did not appear that, in his assessment, the Minister had taken into account - given the “guiding principles” formulated in the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights of 2 August 2001 in the case of Boultif and 18 October 2006 in the case of Üner - the duration of the third applicant’s stay in the Netherlands, the nature and seriousness of the criminal offences of which the third applicant had been convicted, the time that had elapsed since these offences were committed and the third applicant’s behaviour in that period, the social ties established by the third applicant in the Netherlands, and the possibility of return to Afghanistan. Considering that the Minister had attached decisive weight to the third applicant’s criminal record without looking into the nature and seriousness of the offences concerned and without indicating what weight had been given to the other relevant circumstances on the basis of the ‘guiding principles”, the provisional-measures judge concluded that it could not be said that the objection would not have a reasonable chance of success. Consequently, the provisional-measures judge granted the provisional measure and suspended the Minister’s decision of 28 September 2012 pending the outcome of the objection proceedings.', '62.

The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Donetsk.', '6.  According to the police report, at about 7.30 p.m. on 29 November 2001 the applicant, who was drunk, grabbed a bag out of Ms C.’s hands and attempted to run away. Two uniformed police officers, Mr M. and Mr K., who were patrolling the area, heard Ms C.’s cry for help and saw the applicant running with the bag in his hands. They chased the applicant, caught him in the street, restrained him and took him to the nearby police station.', '7.  The applicant alleged that when passing Ms C. in the street he had slipped on the ground and grabbed her bag unintentionally. After that he stood up and moved away. Shortly afterwards he had been knocked down by a heavy blow to the head, lost consciousness and regained it only at the police station.', '8.  According to the applicant, some six police officers at the police station handcuffed him to the window frame and demanded that he confess. When he refused to do so he was beaten. The applicant states that he was allowed to phone his sister only after he had signed a confession. He also alleges that his sister and mother had to bribe a police officer to ensure that he was not detained pending trial.', '9.  On 30 November 2001 the applicant was released from the police station.', '10.  On 10 February 2003 the Kalininsky District Court of Donetsk convicted the applicant of an attempted robbery on 29 November 2001 and fined him 850 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH). The applicant did not appeal against that judgment.', '11.  On 4 December 2001 a forensic medicine expert examined the applicant, on whom he found bruises on the body, abrasion of the left wrist joint and established that the applicant was suffering from concussion. The expert further concluded that these injuries, taken together, were minor.', '12.  According to a certificate issued on 5 December 2001 by a doctor at the local hospital, the applicant was suffering kidney pain as a post-traumatic effect of blows to his back.', '13.  Between 10 December 2001 and 2 January 2002 the applicant underwent medical treatment at the local hospital for the effects of concussion. According to his medical records, he was suffering from headache, general weakness and nausea. On admission to the hospital he alleged that he had been beaten by unknown persons.', '14.  On 14 January 2002 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor’s Office of Kalininsky District of Donetsk (“the District Prosecutor’s Office”) about the ill-treatment allegedly suffered by him.', '15.  On 24 January 2002 the District Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against police officers for the lack of any corpus delicti in their acts.', '16.  On 12 February 2002 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 24 January 2002 as unfounded and remitted the materials for further inquiry.', '17.  On 25 February 2002 the District Prosecutor’s Office refused to open criminal proceedings against the police officers, finding that there was nothing to suggest that they had committed any crime.', '18.  On 18 March 2002 the Donetsk Region Prosecutor’s Office overruled the decision of 25 February 2002, stating that the inquiry had been conducted unsatisfactorily and remitted the case for further examination.', '19.  On 21 March 2002 the forensic medical expert issued an additional report in which he repeated his previous conclusion that the applicant had received bruises to the body, abrasion of the left wrist joint and had suffered concussion, which amounted to minor bodily injuries, and assumed that they could have probably been caused as alleged by the applicant.', '20.  On 15 April 2002 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against police officers due to the lack of any corpus delicti. This finding was based on the discrepancies in the applicant’s testimonies as to the number of police officers involved and the exact place where the beating had allegedly taken place. The fact that the applicant on admission to the local hospital had not indicated the police officers as the source of his injuries had also been mentioned.', '21.  On 13 June 2002 the Voroshylovsky District Court of Donetsk found that the inquiry was flawed, quashed the decision of 15 April 2002 and ordered a further inquiry. The court indicated, inter alia, that the investigative authorities had failed to establish or question persons who had seen the applicant before and after his detention in the police station and to scrutinise the circumstances surrounding the infliction of bodily injuries on the applicant.', '22.  On 8 August 2002 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office decided not to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, stating, inter alia, that the applicant’s allegations were inconsistent and unfounded.', '23.  On 10 October 2002 the Voroshylovsky District Court of Donetsk quashed the decision of 8 August 2002 and ordered further inquiry. The court specified, inter alia, that the authorities had failed to make a proper assessment of the testimonies of Ms C., who had seen the applicant on his arrival at the police station on 29 November 2001, bearing no noticeable signs of beating, and to the usher of the police station and Mr L., who had talked with the applicant next day when he was released.', '24.  On 13 December 2002 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office refused to open criminal proceedings against the police officers, finding that the applicant’s allegations about ill-treatment at the police station had been inconsistent and that the injuries complained of could have been sustained at the scene of crime.', '25.  On 31 January 2003 the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 13 December 2002 and remitted the case for further inquiry into the circumstances in which the applicant received his injuries.', '26.  On 22 February 2003 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office further questioned Mr K. and Mr M., who explained in detail, as far as they could remember, how they had arrested the applicant on 29 November 2001 and the injuries they might have inflicted on him. They admitted that when catching the applicant they had knocked him to the ground, inflicted several blows to restrain him and then handcuffed him.', '27.  On 3 March 2003 the forensic medical expert issued a supplementary report, in which he concluded on the basis of the additional material that the bodily injuries referred to could have been inflicted on the applicant by Mr K. and Mr M. on 29 November 2001 in the course of his detention at the scene of crime. He stated, in particular, that the bruises on the body as well as the concussion could have been received by the applicant when he was knocked to the ground and restrained by the officers; the abrasion of the wrist joint could have been caused by his being handcuffed.', '28.  On 25 March 2003 the Donetsk City Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, stating in particular that the bodily injuries could have been caused to the applicant by Mr K. and Mr M. when catching him at the scene of crime but not at the police station.', '29.  On 30 June 2005 the prosecutor of the Donetsk Region Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 25 March 2003, finding that the inquiry had been flawed, and remitted the case for further examination. He stated, inter alia, that the investigatory authorities had failed to question all the witnesses who saw the applicant on 29-30 November 2001. He further ordered that the relevant room of the police station be inspected with the participation of the applicant and a medical expert be appointed, who would be able to carry out an additional medical examination and clarify thereby the way the applicant received his bodily injuries.', '30.  On 20 July 2005 the General Prosecutor’s Office instituted criminal proceedings against the police officers for exceeding their powers combined with the ill-treatment of the applicant. It admitted that the inquiry into the applicant’s complaints about ill-treatment had not been conducted thoroughly, and that the instructions given by the courts and the higher prosecutors had not been followed.', '31.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Tbilisi.', '7.  The applicant worked as an officer at a regional branch of the Customs Department (hereafter “the old customs office” of “the Department”), an agency of the Ministry of Finance.  Due to the structural reorganisation of the Department on 30 June 1995, he was released by an administrative order of 5 August 1995, together with some other people. This order noted that the discharged officers were to be transferred to another, newly established regional customs office (“the new customs office”).', \"8.  On 5 August 1995 the applicant requested the Department's authorisation to take up his duties at the new customs office. No reply was forthcoming. For the next six years, he complained on numerous occasions before various governmental agencies about the inability to continue his service.\", \"9. In a letter of 21 March 2001, the Department informed the applicant that, after its reorganisation on 30 June 1995, staff had been significantly reduced and, in so far as he had continuously been absent from the old customs office without authorisation, the administration had decided not to employ him any longer. The lawfulness of such a decision, the letter noted, was assured by the provisions of the Labour Code (“the LC”), the sole legislative act which regulated civil servants' labour disputes at that time. The applicant was invited to visit the Department's human resources office, in order to obtain the order for his dismissal and the work log.\", '10.  On 23 May 2001 the applicant sued the Department for unfair dismissal, requesting reinstatement to his position and compensation for loss of salary.', \"11.  In a first instance judgment of 22 November 2001, the Isani-Samgori District Court in Tbilisi found in the applicant's favour. However, in an appellate decision of 15 April 2002, the Tbilisi Regional Court rejected his action as time-barred. The appellate court first noted that, in so far as the Civil Service Act of 31 October 1997 had not been enacted at the time of the applicant's dismissal, only the provisions of the LC had been applicable to the dispute. Given the fact that the applicant had continuously been complaining before various authorities, except for the courts, about his inability to pursue his duties as a customs officer, the appellate court found that he had been well aware of the alleged breach of his rights since his dismissal took effect in 1995. In such circumstances, it concluded that the applicant had failed to comply with the one-month time-limit for lodging an employment action, as required by Article 204 § 1 of the LC.\", \"12.  In May 2002 the applicant lodged a cassation claim, in which he called into question the appellate court's assessment of the circumstances of the case and certain evidence. It appears from the case file that the respondent Department did not submit any reply to that claim.\", \"13.  On 12 June 2002 the Civil Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court of Georgia (“the Chamber”) at an oral hearing attended by the applicant, started the examination of the case but, due to the absence of the Department's representative, adjourned it. The Chamber also decided to dispense with an oral hearing in the further proceedings.\", \"14.  On 13 June 2002 the applicant, complaining about the absence of an oral hearing, requested the President of the Supreme Court to change the Chamber's composition. In a decision of 18 June 2002, the Chamber dismissed this request as unsubstantiated.\", \"15.  In a decision of 19 June 2002, adopted under the written procedure, the Chamber dismissed the applicant's cassation claim. Having confirmed the appellate court's interpretation of the LC, it stated that it lacked jurisdiction to inquire into matters of fact, in so far as the applicant had not raised any “additional and well-founded cassation argument” (Article 407 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure).\"], 'applicants': ['RIZHAMADZE'], 'defendants': ['GEORGIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['11', '12', '13', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '30', '4', '5'], 'X': ['43', '44']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 9], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 9], 'explained_indices': [3, 0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'explained_distances': [0.3583116, 0.16585213, 0.15632612, 0.098179996, 0.09500402, 0.03499484, 0.014164686, 0.014164686, 0.014164686, 0.014164686], 'number_of_sentences': 10, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Charlotte, North Carolina (the United States).', '6.  On 7 June 2008 the applicant married Ms K.A., a Croatian national, in Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina). On 29 November 2008 K.A. gave birth to their son, N.A. In May 2009 she moved to the United States of America to join her husband.', '7.  In June 2011 the applicant’s wife and son spent their summer holidays in Croatia. They were supposed to return to the United States on 31 August 2011. Instead, the applicant’s wife sent him an e-mail, informing him that she and their son were to remain in Croatia and that she had brought a civil action against him there, seeking a divorce (see paragraph 51 below).', '8.  On 7 September 2011 the applicant’s legal representative sent an e-mail to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Ministarstvo zdravstva i socijalne skrbi, hereafter “the relevant Ministry”), as the Croatian Central Authority within the meaning of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the Hague Convention”, see paragraph 61 below). She asked the Ministry to urgently contact the applicant’s wife and take other appropriate measures to seek the voluntary return of the child until the receipt of the official request under the Hague Convention from the United States Central Authority.', '9.  On 15 September 2011 the Ministry forwarded the applicant’s request to the competent local social welfare centre with a view to establishing his wife’s intentions regarding their son and the possibility of a voluntary return to the United States. The centre immediately invited her for an interview. During the interview of 26 September 2011 she stated that while living in the United States she had been subjected to constant psychological abuse by the applicant. She did not oppose the applicant’s having contact with their son, but insisted that any contact take place under the supervision of a child welfare professional.', '10.  On 3 October 2011 the Ministry received an official request from the United States Central Authority under the Hague Convention for the return of the applicant’s son.', '11.  On 13 October 2011 the Ministry forwarded the request for return to the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court (Općinski građanski sud u Zagrebu) and thus instituted non-contentious proceedings for the return of the applicant’s son. The court received the request the next day.', '12.  On 24 October 2011 the court invited the local social welfare centre to submit a report on the applicant’s wife’s social and financial situation, the reasons for her taking the child to Croatia, the child’s general and psychological condition, and the potential effects on his mental development of any decision to return him to the United States. On the same day the court also invited the applicant’s wife to respond to her husband’s request for the boy to be returned.', '13.  In her response of 15 November 2011 the applicant’s wife opposed his request for the return of their child, with or without her. She submitted in particular that the applicant had agreed to her trip to Croatia and that his consent was not time-limited. She also stated that the applicant had expressly forbidden her to return to their flat in the United States, that he had been abusing her, and that there, unlike in Croatia, she had been completely dependent on him in every way (financially, economically, and in terms of accommodation). Lastly, she claimed that no significant changes had occurred in the care the child was receiving, given that she had been the one taking care of their son thus far, which was the reason why the child was very emotionally attached to her.', '14.  On 30 November 2011 the court reiterated its request of 24 October 2011 to the local social welfare centre.', '15.  On 13 December 2011 the local social welfare centre submitted its report and supplemented it, at the court’s request, six days later. The report stated that the applicant’s wife was taking adequate care of their son and recognised his needs, that she was emotionally positively focused on him and that he was affectionate towards her. The report also stated that she did not undermine the applicant’s role as a father, and that she encouraged the child to have contact with him, but that she felt the need to protect him from the applicant’s possible irrational behaviour, which concern the centre considered credible. The child was mentally stable, showed no signs of trauma due to the separation from his father, and had adapted well to the new situation. The report noted that the child was emotionally attached to his mother, with whom he had spent every day since birth, and that separation from her and returning him to his father would be traumatic. The centre therefore considered that returning the child to the United States would not be in his best interest.', '16.  On 22 December 2011 the applicant submitted to the court a certified copy of the decision of a court in North Carolina of 26 October 2011 granting him interim custody of his son.', '17.  In her submissions of 28 December 2011 his wife argued that the report of the social welfare centre suggested that returning her son to the United States would expose him to psychological harm or place him in an intolerable situation within the meaning of Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 62 below). She therefore invited the court to dismiss the applicant’s request for return on that ground.', '18.  On 18 January 2012 the relevant Ministry asked the court to inform it of developments in the case. The court delivered the requested information on 8 February 2012.', '19.  On 26 January 2012 the court invited the applicant’s representative to submit rectified translations of the documents submitted on 22 December 2011, given that certain dates had been wrongly translated. The applicant did so on 9 February 2012.', '20.  In his submissions of 26 January and 17 February 2012 the applicant argued that the report and recommendation of the local social welfare centre did not correspond to the objectives, spirit and purpose of the Hague Convention. He explained that the purpose of the Hague Convention was the prompt return of the child, and not an assessment of the child’s adaptation to a new environment. The applicant further argued that his wife had not presented any evidence for her allegations of abuse, and that she had never intended to establish a permanent relationship with him. He averred that tolerating his wife’s conduct in the proceedings constituted a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Hague Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.', '21.  In her submissions of 28 and 29 February 2012 the applicant’s wife replied by contesting all the applicant’s arguments, and submitted evidence in support of her allegations of abuse. In particular, she submitted a letter from the president and founder of the association for the protection of victims of domestic violence WISH, based in Charlotte, where she had sought help while living in the United States. She also stated that the applicant no longer lived in their matrimonial home in the United States and wondered where the child was supposed to return.', '22.  On 15 March 2012 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s request for the return of the child. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:\\n“... having regard to the fact that the separation of N.A. from his mother and from a safe environment would without a doubt have harmful and traumatic consequences for his psychological development, and that granting the applicant’s request might cause psychological trauma to the child and place him in an unfavourable position within the meaning of Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the [Hague] Convention, and having regard to the mother’s fear that the child would, upon his return to the United States, be subject to psychological and verbal abuse, which fear was deemed justified by the psychologist and the social worker of the social welfare centre ... and having regard to the fact that on 12 July 2011 proceedings for divorce of the parties were instituted, in which proceedings the court should decide on custody of the child and on the other parent’s contact rights, the petitioner’s request must be dismissed, without violating Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights or Article 9 of the Convention on the Rights of a Child, it was decided as in the operative part of this decision.”', '23.  On 17 April 2012 the applicant appealed against that decision, alleging procedural errors, incomplete findings of fact, and misapplication of substantive law as grounds for appeal. In particular, the applicant argued that his wife’s submissions of 28 and 29 February 2012 had been served on him together with the contested first-instance decision and thus in breach of the principle of equality of arms, that the court had not held a single hearing in the case, and that it had wrongly applied Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the Hague Convention.', '24.  On 2 July 2012 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) allowed the applicant’s appeal, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:\\n“... the first-instance court based [its] decision in part on undisputed facts, and in the relevant part on the arguments and the evidence submitted by the counterparty... even though it failed to give an opportunity to the petitioner to comment on them ... [T]herefore the petitioner’s appeal had to be allowed, the first-instance decision quashed and the case remitted ...”', '25.  On 27 August 2012 the decision of the Zagreb County Court was served on the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court.', '26.  In the resumed proceedings, on 17 October 2012 the applicant sought the withdrawal of Judge M.S.B., the first-instance court judge sitting in the case, for alleged bias on her part in favour of his wife. On 21 January 2013 the President of Zagreb Municipal Civil Court granted the application for the judge’s withdrawal, and on 30 January 2013 assigned the case to another judge.', '27.  In his submissions of 28 January 2013 the applicant invited the court to review recordings of his conversations with his son via Skype, and asked for a provisional measure ordering the seizure of his son’s passport with a view to preventing his wife from removing him from Croatia.', '28.  On 4 February 2013 the court invited the applicant to submit certificates from the relevant United States authorities on his son’s habitual residence in that country and the social background of the child within the meaning of Article 13 paragraph 3 of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 62 below). On 22 February 2013 the applicant submitted documents on his permanent residence and his son’s habitual residence in the United States, and on 19 March 2013 he submitted information on the social background of the child.', '29.  On 14 February 2013 the applicant urged the court to schedule a hearing.', '30.  On 28 February 2013 the court ordered the local social welfare centre to promptly assess whether the child was settled in his new environment in terms of Article 12 paragraph 2 of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 62 below).', '31.  In submissions she made on the same day, 28 February 2013, the applicant’s wife reiterated that she believed that the evidence showed that the applicant was abusive, and in that respect pointed to the opinion of the psychologist from the local social welfare centre, who had indicated that the applicant’s communication with his son via Skype constituted emotional blackmail and amounted to emotional abuse. She emphasised that she could not return to the United States, because her green card had expired and she did not have any means of supporting herself there.', '32.  On 26 March 2013 the local social welfare centre submitted the opinion of its psychologist prepared on the basis of interviews with the applicant’s wife and son. The psychologist stated that the child’s physical and mental development was normal and that he had adapted well. She emphasised that owing to his age and his mother’s constant care for him since birth the child was emotionally primarily attached to her; separating them would therefore be traumatising for him.', '33.  In his submissions of 8 April 2013 the applicant argued that the psychologist’s opinion was flawed, unprofessional and arbitrary. He therefore proposed that his son be examined by independent experts, namely an institution with no role in the proceedings. The court eventually agreed to the applicant’s proposal, and on 30 September and 31 October 2013 decided to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry (see paragraph 39 below).', '34.  In submissions made on 15 and 26 April 2013 the applicant’s wife commented on the documents on the child’s social background submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 28 above). She stated that those documents were not relevant, because they had not been provided by the competent authorities of the United States but by a private law firm lacking in professional competencies and jurisdiction for issuing such documents. She stated, inter alia, that the lawyer who had compiled the report did not speak Croatian and thus could not possibly have understood the applicant’s conversations with his son and make an assessment.', '35.  In his submissions of 3 May 2013 the applicant argued that his wife’s conduct in the proceedings amounted to abuse of process and warned the court that the resultant delay was operating in her favour.', '36.  On 6 May 2013 the court invited the applicant to submit evidence that his wife, as his son’s mother, could return to the United States, in particular that she would be provided with a visa, accommodation and a work permit. The applicant did so on 29 May 2013; his wife made further comments on 1 July 2013.', '37.  In his submissions of 27 September 2013 the applicant stated that the way the court had conducted the proceedings was unacceptable in view of their nature and the State’s obligation under the Hague Convention. He further submitted that his rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had also been violated.', '38.  On 22 October 2013 the applicant’s wife responded to his submission, also citing Article 8 of the Convention. She also reiterated that she could no longer return to the United States, because her green card had expired.', '39.  On 5 December 2013 the forensic expert in psychiatry (see paragraph 33 above) submitted her expert opinion and report on whether the return to the United States would expose the child to psychological harm. The opinion and report were prepared after conducting two interviews with the applicant’s son on 20 and 27 November 2013, the first in the presence of the mother and the second in her absence. She stated that: (a) the child was well adapted to his new environment, (b) he was showing no signs of trauma, (c) the applicant’s wife did not have a negative influence on the child regarding his relationship with the applicant as his father, (d) the separation from his mother as primary caregiver and “safe base” would traumatise him, (e) transferring the child into a different environment would also constitute a trauma, but that he would be able to overcome it if his mother lived with him and if he lived in a harmonious environment, (f) the relationship between the child and his mother was positive, enabling him to develop a “secure attachment” to her, (g) the relationship between the child and his father could not be assessed, as the father had not been subjected to an expert assessment. As regards this last point the expert nevertheless made the following observations:\\n“N. is a boy who is securely attached to his mother but also has a positive attitude towards his father, which means that the mother did not influence him [in that regard] by expressing negative views, stories, and so on ... One important factor is that the boy talks with his father, which he mentioned during the assessment, and in this way forms an opinion about him. What is most important however is that the parents coordinate their [behaviour] towards the child in order not to confuse him, which could jeopardise his normal mental development. During the assessment of the boy I did not find that such an issue was present ... [The child] does not object to going to America, but accepts it only if it is temporary and his mother can come along ... He does not show, verbally or non-verbally, any aversion to his father. It is therefore assumed that the mother influences him positively in that regard.”', '40.  On 2 January 2014 the relevant Ministry invited the Municipal Civil Court to speed up the proceedings and again submit a progress report (see paragraph 18 above). The court submitted the requested report on 14 February 2014.', '41.  In his submissions of 22 January 2014 the applicant commented on the expert report and opinion. He argued that the report suggested that his son had good memories of him and a positive attitude towards him, and that it was therefore evident that his return to the United States would not expose him to the risk envisaged in Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the Hague Convention. As regards the expert’s finding that the child’s return would be a traumatic experience for him, the applicant submitted that this would not have been the case had the domestic courts ordered his return within the time-limit set forth in Article 11 paragraph 2 of the Hague Convention. In any event, the evidence he submitted had suggested that his wife could accompany his son on his return to the United States, which according to the expert would have eliminated the risk of trauma.', '42.  On 31 January 2014 the applicant’s wife commented on the expert report and opinion by endorsing it. She argued that they, together with the previous opinions and reports of the local social welfare centre, suggested that it was evident the child should not be returned, as he would thereby suffer psychological trauma. The conditions set forth in Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) had therefore been met.', '43.  By a decision of 21 May 2014 the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s request for his son to be returned. It first held that the applicant’s wife’s removal of their son from the United States to Croatia was “wrongful” within the meaning of Article 2 of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 62 below). It then held, relying exclusively on the opinion and report of the local social welfare centre of 13 December 2011 and the opinion of the forensic expert in psychiatry of 5 December 2013 (see paragraphs 15 and 39 above), that the applicant’s son’s return to the United States would expose him to risk envisaged in Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the said Convention, but only if he returned without his mother. However, since the applicant had not proved that she could freely return to the United States and get a job there, the court concluded that the conditions for refusing the return of the child set forth in that Article had been met.', '44.  On 11 June 2014 the applicant appealed against that decision. He referred to procedural errors, incomplete findings of facts, and misapplication of the substantive law as grounds for appeal. In particular, the applicant submitted that the first-instance court had, in breach of the principle of adversarial hearing, not held a single hearing in the case, and that it had not informed him of its decision to obtain an opinion from a forensic expert in psychiatry, thus preventing him from objecting to the choice of the expert. He further complained that he had not been involved in the expert’s assessment, even though he had previously expressed willingness to make himself available for such an assessment. The applicant also stated that the court had required him to prove that his wife could return to the United States and find a job there, instead of asking her to prove that she could not. It had thereby unjustifiably shifted the burden of proof to him as regards those matters. Moreover, as regards those matters the court had drawn the wrong conclusions from the evidence presented, and had embarked on an interpretation of foreign law it was not familiar with. Lastly, the applicant argued that the first-instance court had wrongly applied Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) of the Hague Convention.', '45.  By a decision of 22 October 2014 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision.', '46.  On 29 December 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance decision. It would appear that the proceedings are currently pending before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske).', '47.  Meanwhile, on 17 January 2013 the applicant lodged a request for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (zahtjev za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku) with the Zagreb County Court about the length of the above proceedings. He argued that the proceedings had lasted for one year and four months without a scheduled hearing or a decision rendered, contrary to Article 11 of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 62 below) and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.', '48.  By a decision of 15 June 2014 the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant’s request. It held that the proceedings complained of had thus far lasted some two years and eight months, which could not be considered excessive, especially as there had been no substantial periods of inactivity.', '49.  On 9 September 2014 the applicant appealed against that decision.', '50.  By a decision of 20 November 2014 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision of 15 June 2014.', '51.  Meanwhile, on 12 July 2011 the applicant’s wife brought a civil action against the applicant in the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court seeking a divorce and custody of their son.', '52.  On 18 July 2011 she asked the court to issue a provisional measure granting her interim custody of N. until delivery of the final judgment in those proceedings.', '53.  In his submissions of 3 July 2012 the applicant argued that the Croatian courts lacked international jurisdiction in the case, and submitted a certified translation of the decision of a court in North Carolina of 27 April 2012 granting him sole custody of his son.', '54.  At the hearing held on 9 July 2012 the court dismissed the applicant’s objection regarding lack of jurisdiction.', '55.  By a decision of 15 October 2012 the court issued the provisional measure requested by the applicant’s wife and awarded her interim custody of their son.', '56.  On 21 November 2012 the applicant appealed against that decision to the Zagreb County Court.', '57.  On 24 April 2014 that court returned the case file to the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court, warning it that under Article 16 of the Hague Convention the judicial or administrative authorities of the State to which the child had been removed were not entitled to decide on the right of custody of the child until it had been determined under the Hague Convention that the child was not to be returned (see paragraph 62 below). Accordingly, it instructed the Municipal Civil Court to ascertain whether a final decision had been given in the proceedings for the return of the child. If no such decision was adopted, the County Court further instructed the Municipal Court to stay the proceedings until the delivery of such a decision.'], 'applicants': ['ADŽIĆ'], 'defendants': ['CROATIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['15', '22', '31', '39', '44', '45', '47', '48', '49', '50', '58', '59', '62', '63', '64', '71', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '84', '85', '86', '9', '94', '96']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 10, 17, 26, 34, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 10, 17, 26, 34, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'explained_indices': [26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 51, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 41, 25, 52, 13, 20, 11, 12, 19, 18, 7, 8, 9, 10, 23, 14, 24, 16, 17, 31, 30, 29, 28, 21, 22, 15, 4, 0, 5, 6, 2, 1, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048424, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.005048394, 0.003212154, -0.008119881, -0.05079469, -0.06359115, -0.07323775, -0.07950908, -0.2725445], 'number_of_sentences': 53, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Liepāja', '6.  On 7 March 1999 the applicant’s neighbour called the ambulance service and the municipal police and informed them that the applicant was going to jump out of the window of her fifth-floor apartment. She also reported that the applicant was shouting and swearing in her apartment, throwing papers outside and pouring water out of the window.', '7.  After the ambulance arrived, the applicant refused to comply with the paramedic’s request that she open the door, whereupon rescuers were called. They entered the applicant’s apartment through a window and let the paramedic in.', '8.  The applicant told the paramedic that she had received threats and that the mafia had kidnapped her and operated on her organs without leaving any marks. After having observed that the applicant’s overall condition was satisfactory and that her mood had shifted during the conversation, the paramedic suggested that the applicant might be suffering from an endogenous disease and took her to the Liepāja psychiatric hospital in the ambulance car. The applicant was accompanied to the hospital by her mother and a police officer.', '9.  Later the same day the applicant was examined by a duty doctor, S., who made the following notes:\\n“The neighbours called the police saying that [the applicant] had been throwing papers out of the window and swearing and shouting. According to [the applicant], for more than a year [she] has been receiving threats from unknown persons ... According to [the applicant’s] mother, [the applicant] has been suffering from a mental disease for about two years, which began as depression and evolved into delusions of persecution. [The applicant had] said that her organs had been operated on ... [The applicant’s] speech is chaotic; [she] tries to deny everything, except the delusions. [The applicant] is nervous ... asks to be allowed to go home. [She] denies the hallucinations ... [Her] somatic condition [is] without pathology. Diagnosis: hallucinatory paranoid condition ...”', '10.  On the same day the applicant was admitted for in-patient medical treatment and prescribed medicines.', '11.  On 9 March 1999 a panel of three psychiatrists, consisting of the doctor S. and two other doctors practising at the same medical establishment, concluded that the applicant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that it was necessary for her to continue in-patient medical treatment.\\n“Regard being had to the anamnesis of the illness and symptoms, the patient suffers from paranoid schizophrenia: it is therefore necessary to continue with emergency in-patient medical treatment”.', '12.  From 11 to 30 March 1999 the applicant underwent in-patient medical treatment in a psychiatric hospital. From 1 to 6 April 1999 she was given hospital leave, which was extended until 13 April 1999, after which she was discharged from hospital.', '13.  On various occasions after her release from hospital the applicant asked the Liepāja prosecutor’s office to institute criminal proceedings concerning the allegedly unlawful actions of the municipal police officer and the medical staff at the time of her compulsory admission to the psychiatric hospital. She appealed to the Kurzeme district public prosecutor’s office against the refusals to institute criminal proceedings. Her appeals were dismissed in June 1999 and December 2001. The applicant appealed against those decisions to the Office of the Prosecutor General, which dismissed them in May and July 2003.', '14.  On 15 March 2000 the applicant asked the administration of the Liepāja psychiatric hospital to provide her with the excerpts from her medical file concerning the reasons for her compulsory confinement in a psychiatric hospital on 7 March 1999. She also sought to obtain information about the medical treatment she had received during her stay in hospital. On 29 March 2000 the hospital informed the applicant that the requested information would be furnished only at a court’s request.', '15.  On 11 April 2000 the applicant complained to the Inspectorate of Quality Control for Medical Care and Working Capability (“the MADEKKI”) about her allegedly unlawful compulsory confinement in a psychiatric hospital. In its response dated 26 May 2000 the MADEKKI concluded that on 7 March 1999 the applicant had been committed for an in-patient medical examination pursuant to section 68 of the Law on Medical Treatment (Ārstniecības likums) and that her medical treatment had been adequate.', '16.  On 10 August 2000 the applicant and her mother filed an administrative complaint with the Liepāja Court against the doctor S. and the paramedic who had accompanied the applicant to hospital on 7 March 1999. The claimants asked the court to declare the applicant’s confinement unlawful and to overturn the diagnosis in part.', '17.  The court refused to register the claim, owing to various procedural deficiencies. On appeal by the applicant, the Kurzeme Regional Court upheld the lower court’s decision, stating that the doctor and the paramedic were not public officials whose decisions could be the subject of an administrative complaints procedure. Besides, it was noted that the applicant had failed to submit the complaint within the one-month time-limit from the adoption of the final decision of the MADEKKI. It also indicated that the claimants should bring a civil claim if they considered that they had sustained damage as a result of the defendants’ actions. The decision became final because none of the parties appealed.', '18.  On an unspecified date the applicant and her mother lodged defamation proceedings against their neighbours, asking the Liepāja Court to find that the defendants had uttered false information concerning the applicant’s behaviour on 7 March 1999. The applicant also claimed damages from the paramedic who had taken her to hospital and allegedly provided false information concerning her health to the duty doctor.', '19.  On 27 April 2000 the court upheld the claim in part, finding that it could not be established that on the day in question the applicant had threatened to jump out of the window. However, it dismissed the remainder of the claim. The court noted, inter alia, that the information from the applicant’s neighbours and the conversation with the applicant (see paragraph 8, above), as well as the latter’s appearance and her mother’s statements, had provided sufficient grounds for the paramedic to admit the applicant to hospital. It appears that none of the parties appealed.', '20.  On 10 August 2000 the applicant and her mother lodged a civil claim against the doctor S. They asked the Liepāja Court to declare that the applicant had been unlawfully confined in the psychiatric hospital and to order the doctor to remove the allegedly false symptoms from her medical records, in particular, the aggression, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. In the statement of claim the claimants argued that, despite her stable state of health, the applicant had been confined in a psychiatric hospital owing to false information provided by her neighbour and that the doctor had reached her diagnosis without duly examining the patient.', '21.  On 11 December 2000 the applicant underwent a court-ordered forensic psychiatric examination. The experts concluded that the applicant suffered from chronic schizophrenia and that, according to her medical records, on 7 March 1999 she had been in a condition which potentially endangered her health and life.', '22.  On 14 February 2001 the Liepāja Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. It established that the defendant had acted in accordance with the Law on Medical Treatment; that the expert had correctly diagnosed her condition; and that her mental state had necessitated compulsory hospitalisation.', '23.  On 9 October 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment. The court dismissed as irrelevant the outcome of the defamation proceedings (see paragraph 19 above), establishing that this was not crucial in reaching the decision regarding the applicant’s compulsory admission to the psychiatric hospital and that the panel of psychiatrists had made its diagnosis after having examined the applicant.', '24.  On 16 January 2002 the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant.'], 'applicants': ['L.M.'], 'defendants': ['LATVIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5'], 'violated_articles': ['5'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['12']}, 'silver_rationales': [7], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7], 'explained_indices': [2, 1, 4, 0, 3, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 9, 10, 18, 8, 7, 6, 5, 11, 19], 'explained_distances': [0.5354813, 0.47193724, 0.4629779, 0.43379757, 0.34787825, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991, 0.13805991], 'number_of_sentences': 20, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

According to the prison clinic’s registry provided by the Government, the applicant was examined by the prison doctor who considered that he was suffering from a tension headache. The doctor decided to transfer the applicant to a neurology department of a hospital. The Government submitted that, since there was no neurology department at Inebolu State Hospital, the applicant was transferred to Kastamonu State Hospital where he was examined by a doctor at the Neurology Department on 25 March 2004.', '7.  In the meantime, on 19 January 2004 the applicant filed a petition with the Inebolu Judge for the Execution of Sentences, after an oral refusal by the prison authorities, requesting copies of the doctor’s report issued after his medical examination of 14 January 2004 and the relevant pages of the prison clinic’s registry.', '8.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Pyatigorsk, Stavropol region.', '7.  On 16 June 2000 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant, a police investigator. The investigating authority charged him with taking a bribe involving a large sum of money, aggravated by extortion, under Article 290 § 4 (c) and (d) of the Criminal Code, together with a number of other offences.', '8.  The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearings before the Stavropol Regional Court.', '9.  On 2 October 2000 the Stavropol Regional Court delivered a judgment. In respect of the legal characterisation of the acts the applicant was found to have committed, it held as follows:\\n“... the court finds the classification of the acts of Abramyan E.N. by the preliminary investigation authorities to have been erroneous and classifies his acts under Articles 30 § 3 and 159 § 3 (b) of the UK RF [Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]. It was established that Abramyan, through the abuse of official authority and with a view to misappropriating another’s property, misled witness [L.], claiming that he would forward her case to a court. He then fraudulently obtained two thousand US dollars from [L.], via [D.], having kept from [D.] and [L.] the fact that the proceedings had already been terminated. Taking into account the amount that was stolen and the fact that Abramyan had no real opportunity to dispose of the money, having been arrested at the scene, the court regards his acts as attempted misappropriation, through the abuse of official authority, of another’s property, involving a large sum of money, since he committed all the acts necessary in order to misappropriate another’s property and failed to complete the crime due to circumstances beyond his control.”', '10.  The court convicted the applicant under Articles 30 § 3 and 159 § 3 (b) of the Criminal Code, acquitted him on the remaining charges and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment and imposed a confiscation order.', '11.  According to the record of the hearing, after pronouncing the judgment the presiding judge explained to the applicant the procedure and time-limit for appealing against the judgment. He explained that convicted persons could participate in the examination of their case by an appeal body.', '12.  The applicant appealed against the judgment. In particular, he complained that the court’s classification of his actions had been erroneous. In his appeal against the judgment the applicant did not request that he be summoned to the hearing before the appeal court or that he be informed of the date of the hearing. Nor did he or his lawyer lodge a separate request to that effect.', '13.  On 27 December 2000 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation held an appeal hearing at which neither the applicant nor his counsel were present. The Supreme Court heard a prosecutor K. who argued that the judgment should be upheld. It examined the applicant’s points of appeal, reviewed the judgment and found that the trial court had correctly established the facts based on the evidence examined by it and had given the correct legal classification of the acts which the applicant had been found to have committed.

The first applicant is the mother of Magomed-Ali Abayev, who was born in 1970. The second applicant is his wife and the third applicant is his son. The fourth applicant is the mother of Anvar Shaipov, who was born in 1976.', '6.  At the material time the town of Urus-Martan was under curfew. The first applicant lived there with Magomed-Ali Abayev and other relatives at 12 Lenin Street. Their house was in the town centre and less than a hundred metres from the nearest checkpoint of the Russian military forces. The checkpoint and its staff occupied two buildings; one was the building of the former Siluet clothing factory and the other was a nearby smaller building in Lenin Street.', \"7.  At about 4 p.m. on 13 September 2000 Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov left the first applicant's house. They were walking to the town centre when two Russian servicemen at the checkpoint stopped them. The servicemen took their passports and one of the soldiers went with them into the factory building. A few minutes later he came out, took Magomed‑Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov into the building and returned to the checkpoint without them.\", \"8.  The applicants' neighbours Mr R.G. and Mr M.A. witnessed Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov being taken into the factory building and did not see them come out. Several minutes later Mr R.G. asked the servicemen at the checkpoint why Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov were still in the building; he did not receive any response. Meanwhile Mr M.A. went to the first applicant's house and informed her and the second applicant about the arrest of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov at the checkpoint.\", '9.  The first and the second applicants immediately went to the checkpoint and asked the soldiers why Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been arrested. They were told that the two men had been taken into the building for an identity check and that they would be released shortly. The applicants decided to wait for the men at the entrance to the building. While they were waiting, a grey military UAZ vehicle with open windows drove up to the factory building. The soldiers opened the factory gates and let the car into the yard. Shortly after its arrival the car left with its windows closed.', '10.  After the car drove away the second applicant asked one of the soldiers about Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov. The soldier spoke with someone on his portable radio set and told her that the two men had been released from the other side of the factory building.', '11.  At that time the father of Magomed-Ali Abayev, Mr V.A., arrived at the checkpoint and went to the other side of the building to meet his son and Anvar Shaipov. About five minutes later he returned and told the first and the second applicants that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had not left the building. He further informed them that he had met an acquaintance who had been waiting for someone on the other side of the building for two hours and that this man had not seen Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov leaving the factory building.', \"12.  Then the second applicant went to the fourth applicant's house and told her Anvar Shaipov had been arrested. The second and the fourth applicants immediately went to the town centre, where they met the first applicant. In the late afternoon all of them managed to speak to the deputy head of the Urus-Martan district administration, Mr L.M., who told them that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been taken to the “West” group of the Russian federal forces (группировка федеральных сил 'Запад') stationed in the village of Tangi-Chu in the Urus-Martan district, and that on 14 September 2000 the applicants' relatives would be brought back to Urus-Martan.\", '13.

The subsequent events', '14.  On the morning of 14 September 2000 the deputy head of the administration, Mr L.M., told the applicants that he had not been able to find out where Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been taken. He suggested that they had been taken either to the main military base of the Russian federal forces in Khankala or to the detention centre of the Russian federal forces in the settlement of Chernokozovo.', '15.  On 14 September 2000 the two applicant families started a joint search for Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov. For the first few days the applicants addressed State authorities primarily in person, hoping for an immediate release of their relatives.', \"16.  In the end of September 2000 (in the submitted documents the date was also stated as October 2001) a young Chechen man came to the fourth applicant's house. He did not introduce himself. He told her that he had seen Anvar Shaipov at the headquarters of infantry regiment no. 245 of the West group of the Russian federal forces. Anvar Shaipov had been chopping firewood. He had told the man that he had been arrested by Russian military servicemen and asked him to inform his relatives that he had been detained at the headquarters of infantry regiment no. 245 of the West group. The young man said he had never heard of Magomed-Ali Abayev.\", '17.  Since the end of September 2000 the applicants have had no news of their disappeared relatives.', \"18.  The Government did not challenge most of the facts as presented by the applicants. According to their submission, “...on 15 August 2002 M.A. Shaipova complained to the Urus-Martan district prosecutor's office that between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 13 September 2000 her son Anvar Shaipov was abducted by identified men in civilian clothing next to the former Siluet clothing factory in Lenin Street, Urus-Martan... on 15 December 2000 a similar complaint was received by the Urus-Martan district prosecutor's office from A. Abayeva...”.\", \"19.  From 13 September 2000 onwards the applicants repeatedly applied in person and in writing to various public bodies. They have been supported in their efforts by the Memorial NGO. In their letters to the authorities the applicants referred to their relatives' arrest and asked for assistance and details of the investigation. Mostly these enquiries have remained unanswered, or purely formal replies have been given in which the applicants' requests have been forwarded to various prosecutors' offices. The applicants submitted some of their letters and the authorities' replies to the Court; these documents are summarised below.\", \"20.  On 26 and 29 September 2000 the fourth applicant complained to the Urus-Martan district prosecutor's office (the district prosecutor's office) about her son's abduction. She described the circumstances of his arrest and requested assistance in searching for him. She also stated that her son had been seen in the village of Tangi-Chu, on the premises of infantry regiment no. 245 of the West group of federal forces.\", \"21.  On 1 October 2000 the district prosecutor's office forwarded the fourth applicant's complaint to the Urus-Martan district department of the interior (the ROVD) and requested them to open an operational-search file to establish the whereabouts of Anvar Shaipov.\", \"22.  On 19 November 2000 the district prosecutor's office informed the first applicant that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had not been detained at the headquarters of infantry regiment no. 245.\", \"23.  On 27 November 2000 the fourth applicant wrote to the ROVD.

On 21 September 2001 the district prosecutor's office forwarded the first applicant's complaint to the ROVD.\", \"26.  On 1 October 2001 the first applicant complained to the district prosecutor's office. She stated that in spite of all the information she had provided to the authorities they had failed to instigate an investigation into her son's disappearance. The applicant further provided the names and the addresses of the witnesses to the abduction and requested that the authorities instigate an investigation into the abduction of Magomed-Ali Abayev. She requested the authorities to question the servicemen who had been manning the checkpoint on 13 September 2000.\", \"27.  On 19 August 2002 the Chechnya department of the interior forwarded the fourth applicant's complaint to the ROVD, seeking a search for Anvar Shaipov to be set up.\", \"28.  On 28 August 2002 the district prosecutor's office summoned the first applicant for questioning.\", \"29.  On 22 January 2003 the fourth applicant complained to the Urus‑Martan district military commander's office (the district military commander's office). She described in detail the circumstances of her son's abduction and requested assistance in the search for Anvar Shaipov.\", \"30.  On 6 February 2003 the district prosecutor's office forwarded a letter to the first applicant stating that on the same date they had instituted an investigation into the disappearance of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov under Article 126 § 2 of the Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping). The case file had been given the number 34013. According to the applicants, they were informed about this decision only on 11 March 2004 (see paragraph 51 below).\", \"31.  On 18 February 2003 the district prosecutor's office granted the fourth applicant victim status in the criminal case.\", \"32.  On 9 March 2004 the first applicant complained to the district prosecutor's office. She stated that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been arrested by Russian servicemen; that their removal had been witnessed by a number of her neighbours and relatives; and that, in spite of her numerous complaints to the district prosecutor's office, the latter had failed to establish the whereabouts of the disappeared men. The applicant requested the authorities to take the following measures: to initiate an investigation into the abduction of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov, to grant her victim status in the criminal proceedings and conduct an effective investigation into the disappearance.\", \"33.  On 11 March 2004 the district prosecutor's office informed the first applicant that on 6 February 2003 they had instituted an investigation into the disappearance of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov and that on 7 April 2003 the investigation in the criminal case had been suspended for failure to establish the identities of the perpetrators.\", '34.  On 12 April 2004 the first applicant requested the investigators to inform her about the progress of the investigation and take meaningful measures to establish the whereabouts of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov.', '35.  On 6 October 2004 the first applicant requested the investigators to provide her with access to the investigation file and to resume the investigation in the criminal case.', '36.  On 11 October 2004 the investigators informed the first applicant that under Article 42 of the Criminal Procedure Code she was entitled to familiarise herself with the investigation file only upon completion of the investigation. The letter also stated that the investigation had been suspended for failure to establish the identities of the perpetrators.', '37.  On 12 June 2008 the investigators informed the applicants that on the same date they had suspended the investigation in the criminal case for failure to establish the identities of the perpetrators.', '38.  Referring to several witness statements, which are summarised below, and copies of some documents from the investigation file, the Government submitted the following.', \"39.  On 15 December 2002 the first applicant complained to the authorities about the abduction on 13 September 2000 of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov by representatives of a law-enforcement agency stationed in the former clothing factory. She stated that the two men had been taken onto the factory premises by the servicemen and that afterwards they had not returned home. She further stated that she had complained about the abduction to the district prosecutor's office, but the interim district prosecutor, Mr L.I., had refused to open a criminal investigation. The applicant also provided the names and addresses of two witnesses to the abduction and requested the authorities to open a criminal case and to question the representatives of the law-enforcement agency who had been stationed in the factory building at the material time.\", \"40.  On 14 February 2003 the investigators questioned the first applicant's daughter, Ms L.A., who stated that at about 6 p.m. on 13 September 2000 her brother Magomed-Ali Abayev had left home with Anvar Shaipov. About five minutes later their neighbour Mr M.A. had arrived at the first applicant's home and informed the relatives that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been arrested by representatives of a law-enforcement agency and had been taken to the premises of the former clothing factory. The witness and the first applicant had gone immediately to the checkpoint located in the factory building. While they were there a grey UAZ vehicle without registration numbers had driven away from the factory's yard.\", '41.  On 14 February 2003 the ROVD informed the investigators that Anvar Shaipov had not been detained by their officers, that he had not been placed in their detention centre and that his corpse had not been found.', \"42.

Immediately afterwards, the applicant with her daughter and Ms R. Sh. had gone to the checkpoint located in the building and asked the guards to release the arrested men. While the women had been talking to the guards, a grey UAZ vehicle with darkened windows and without registration numbers had driven away from the factory's yard. The women's attempts to obtain information about the arrested men had not produced any results.\", \"43.  On 17 February 2003 the investigators questioned Anvar Shaipov's sister, Ms L.Sh., who stated that on 13 September 2000 she had been at home when Mr A.Zh. had arrived there and informed the family about the arrest of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov by military servicemen stationed at the former clothing factory. The witness and her relatives had immediately gone to the authorities and informed them about the incident. On 18 February 2005 the witness was questioned again and stated that her family had learnt from an acquaintance that in 2000 her brother Anvar Shaipov had been seen at a military unit in Tangi-Chu, Chechnya.\", '44. On 18 and 22 February 2003 the Urus-Martan district department of the Federal Security Service (the FSB) and the Chechnya FSB informed the investigators that they had not arrested or detained Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov and had not opened criminal proceedings against them.', '45.  On 24 February 2003 the investigators conducted a crime scene examination in the building of the former clothing factory. Nothing was collected from the scene.', \"46.  In February 2003 the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor's office, the Kurchaloy district prosecutor's office, the Shali district prosecutor's office and the Nadterechniy district prosecutor's office informed the investigators that they had not opened criminal proceedings against Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov; that they had not arrested or detained them and that their corpses had not been found in their districts.\", '47.

On 5 April 2003 the investigators suspended the investigation in the criminal case for failure to establish the identities of the perpetrators. The applicants were informed about this decision.', \"50.  On 10 March 2004 the first applicant complained to the district prosecutor's office about the abduction of her son and requested that the authorities open a criminal investigation into the incident.\", '51.  On 11 March 2004 the investigators informed the first applicant that in connection with the abduction they had already opened a criminal case, on 5 February 2003.', \"52.  On 11 October 2004 the first applicant requested that the district prosecutor's office provided her with full access to the investigation file. The investigators replied that she was entitled to access only upon completion of the criminal investigation.\", \"53.  On 20 January 2006 the investigators again questioned the first applicant, who stated that on 13 September 2000 her son Magomed-Ali Abayev and her relative Anvar Shaipov had been arrested at the checkpoint situated in Lenin Street in Urus-Martan and taken into the former clothing factory. Referring to the information received by her from the witness to the incident, Mr M.A., Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been stopped by the servicemen who had manned the checkpoint. At first the officers had taken the two men's documents and taken them into the building; a few minutes later Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been taken into the factory. Immediately afterwards Mr M.A. had arrived at the applicant's house and told her that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been detained at the checkpoint. The applicant had gone immediately to the checkpoint and asked the servicemen about Magomed‑Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov. The officers told her that the two men were “being checked” and that they would be released soon. The applicant decided to wait for Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov at the checkpoint. While she was waiting, a grey UAZ vehicle without registration numbers and with darkened windows drove into the factory's yard. About five minutes later the car left the factory and drove in the direction of the town centre. Then the soldiers at the checkpoint told the applicant that they had released Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov through the gates located on the other side of the building, in Krasnoarmeyskaya Street. According to the witness, at the time the checkpoint was being manned by officers of law-enforcement agencies from Yaroslavl and the Yaroslavl Region. The applicant further stated that at some point later Mr M.A. had moved abroad and that her husband, Mr V.A., had died in June 2003.\", '54.  On 24 January 2006 the investigators conducted a crime scene examination at the former clothing factory. Nothing was collected from the scene. According to the transcript, on the date of the examination, a special task force unit of the police (the OMON) from the Kostroma Region was stationed in the factory building.', '55.  In January 2007 the investigators forwarded a number of information requests to various detention centres in Northern Caucasus and the nearby regions. According to the replies from the detention centres in the Kalmyk Republic, the Volgograd region, the Republic of Adigey, the Astrakhan region, the Republic of Dagestan, the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, the Krasnodar region, the Rostov region and the Stavropol region Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov were not detained on their premises.', '56.  On 25 January 2007 the investigators questioned officer Z. who stated that since September 2006 he had been working in Urus-Martan, in the police station located in the building of the former clothing factory. He had previously worked there from November 2003 to April 2004 and during this period of his service Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had not been arrested or detained on the factory premises. At the time a two-storey security post guarding the factory premises had been set up by Russian federal forces in front of the building. The only entrance to the security post had been through the factory building. The witness further stated that he did not know which law-enforcement agency had been stationed in the factory building in 2000.', \"57.  On 31 January 2007 the investigators questioned the first applicant's neighbour, Ms Kh. Kh., who stated that at about 5 p.m. on 13 September 2000 she had been at home when she had seen Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov walking by her house. She had gone into the street and seen the two men next to the checkpoint situated in the former clothing factory. According to the witness, at the time servicemen of a law-enforcement agency were manning the checkpoint. The witness had walked to the checkpoint and seen Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov going into the checkpoint building. Then a UAZ car had passed by her, pulled into the factory's yard and driven away shortly afterwards. After she had arrived at the checkpoint, she had seen relatives of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov who had been waiting for the two men. The servicemen on duty had told them that they had already released Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov and that the two men were waiting for their relatives on the other side of the checkpoint, in Krasnoarmeyskaya Street. The witness also stated that her son Mr M.A. had witnessed all the events and that he had moved abroad at some point later.\", \"58. On 7 February 2007 the Department of the Execution of Punishment of the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia informed the investigators that they had not detained the applicants' relatives.\", \"59.  On 7 February 2007 the investigators questioned the applicants' relative Mr A. Zh., who stated that at about 5 p.m. on 13 September 2000 he had gone to the town centre of Urus-Martan to buy cigarettes. On the way there, next to the checkpoint situated in the former clothing factory, he had seen a crowd of local residents, who had told him that the servicemen at the checkpoint had arrested Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov; that the two men had been taken into the factory yard; that a few minutes later a UAZ car had driven into the yard and that the two men had been taken away in this car. Then he had gone to the fourth applicant's house and told her about the arrest.\", \"60.  On 11 February 2007 the investigators questioned the fourth applicant's daughter, Ms L.Sh., who stated that at about 5 p.m. on 13 September 2000 their relative Mr A. Zh. had arrived at their house and told her about the arrest of Anvar Shaipov. She had immediately informed her relatives about it. The fourth applicant and other relatives had gone to the checkpoint, while the witness stayed at home. The witness further stated that Mr R.G. had witnessed how the two men had been taken into the factory by the servicemen, and provided the investigators with his address. She also stated that her relatives had complained about the abduction to various state authorities in 2000, but that the latter had failed to take measures to establish the whereabouts of the disappeared men. In connection with this she offered to provide the investigators with copies of letters from the district prosecutor's office of 10 October 2000 and 28 February 2002 and from another law-enforcement agency of 19 August 2002, which confirmed the fact that her relatives had then informed the authorities about the abduction, but no tangible measures had been taken.\", \"61.  On 14 February 2007 the investigators questioned the fourth applicant, who stated that at about 5 p.m. on 13 September 2000 she had learnt from Ms R.Zh. that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been arrested by servicemen at the checkpoint located in Lenin Street, in the former clothing factory. The witness had immediately gone there with her relatives. At the checkpoint she had met relatives of Magomed-Ali Abayev. She had learnt from the first applicant that at about 4 p.m. Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been stopped at the checkpoint for an identity check and then taken to the factory; after that a UAZ vehicle had driven into the factory yard and Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been taken away in this car. According to the witness, after she had spoken with the first applicant, the servicemen at the checkpoint had informed them that Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been released from the checkpoint through the other gates, in Krasnoarmeyskaya Street. After that incident her son had disappeared. The witness further stated that in October 2001 a man of average height, who must have been twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, had arrived at her house and told her that two days ago he had been leaving the headquarters of the 245th regiment of the federal forces under the command of General Shamanov and that he had seen Anvar Shaipov there. The latter asked him to inform his family that he was there. The witness had not seen the young man again. In 2002 a woman had arrived at the applicant's house and told her that her son Anvar Shaipov had been detained in the Chernokozovo detention centre in Chechnya. After that the applicant had twice visited the detention centre where he had been told that her son had not been detained there. She did not hear any news about her disappeared son ever since. On 8 June 2007 the investigators again questioned the fourth applicant, who confirmed her previous statement.\", \"62.  On 16 February 2007 the investigators questioned the first applicant's neighbour, Mr R.G., who stated that at the material time he had lived across the street from the first applicant's house. A federal forces checkpoint was next to the former clothing factory; the servicemen manning the checkpoint lived in the factory building. On 13 September 2000 he had been repairing the house gates. Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had greeted him and walked by in the direction of the town centre. Then he had seen that the two men had been stopped at the checkpoint and that the servicemen had asked for their identity documents. After Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had provided their documents, one of the servicemen had taken them into the building. Meanwhile he approached Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov and asked them what was happening. Magomed-Ali Abayev explained to him that the servicemen frequently stopped pedestrians for identity checks and that there was nothing to worry about. After that the servicemen asked Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov to go into the building and the two men went inside. About ten minutes later he asked one of the officers what was taking so long and why Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had not come back. The servicemen called someone on the phone and told him that the two men would be released shortly. Then he went to the applicants and informed them about their relatives' arrest. As the relatives of Magomed-Ali Abayev were approaching the checkpoint, a military UAZ-469 vehicle without a registration number was driving away from the factory premises. The witness said he did not see any passengers in the car, just the driver. When the relatives of Magomed-Ali Abayev arrived at the checkpoint, the servicemen on duty told them that the two men had been released from the factory building at the other gates, in Krasnoarmeyskaya Street. Nonetheless, when the witness expressed disbelief and asked one of the officers: “You saw the two men being taken into the factory?” and the latter replied: “there is no need to involve me in this, those who arrested the two men, they are from another agency” and added that the men who had arrested the applicants' relatives were from military intelligence. The witness further stated that on 13 September 2000 servicemen wearing a particular kind of camouflage uniform called “desert storm” ('буря в пустыне'), had been present at the checkpoint along with its regular staff and that these men had arrested Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov.\", \"63.  On 21 June 2007 the investigators questioned Magomed-Ali Abayev's brother, Mr M.A., who stated that at about 4.30 p.m. on 13 September 2000 his family had been informed about the arrest of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov by men in military uniform at the checkpoint located next to the former clothing factory. According to the witness, the guard at the checkpoint had explained to him that those who had arrested the applicants' relatives had shown military intelligence identity documents and taken Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov into the factory. After that a UAZ car with darkened windows had arrived at the building, Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov had been taken outside, placed in the vehicle and taken to an unknown destination.\", \"64.  On 14 June 2007 the investigators questioned the first applicant's neighbour, Mr Z.M., who stated that on 13 September 2000 his relatives had informed him about the arrest of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov at about 5 p.m. at the checkpoint situated next to the former clothing factory. According to the witness, Anvar Shaipov had not participated in activities of illegal armed groups.\", \"65.  On 1 July 2007 the investigators questioned the fourth applicant's relative Ms T. Sh., whose statement was similar to the one given by Mr Z.M.\", \"66.  According to the Government's submission, the investigation failed to establish the whereabouts of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov. However, it found no evidence to support the involvement of Russian federal forces in the disappearance. The law enforcement authorities of Chechnya and the neighbouring regions had never arrested or detained Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov on criminal or administrative charges and had not carried out a criminal investigation in respect of them. No special operations had been carried out against the applicants' relatives.\", '67.  According to the documents submitted by the Government, the investigation in the criminal case was suspended and resumed on several occasions, and has so far failed to identify those responsible for the abduction of Magomed-Ali Abayev and Anvar Shaipov.', '68.  The Government further submitted that the applicants had been duly informed of all decisions taken during the investigation.', '69.  Despite specific requests by the Court the Government did not disclose most of the contents of criminal case no. 34013, but mainly provided copies of the information requests forwarded to various law‑enforcement agencies and their replies, and copies of several witness statements, summarised above. The Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of other documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained personal data concerning witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings.', \"70.  On 23 October 2004 the first applicant complained to the Urus‑Martan town court. She sought a ruling obliging the investigators to provide her with access to the investigation file, to resume the investigation and to conduct it thoroughly and effectively. In her complaint she referred to the Constitution and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. On 22 November 2004 the town court rejected her claim. The applicant appealed.\\nOn 8 February 2005 the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic upheld the town court's ruling. The text of the Supreme Court decision stated, inter alia, the following:\\n“...it follows from the contents of the investigation file that on 13 September 2000 representatives of Russian power structures had arrested M.-A. Abayev along with other persons and that in connection with this the criminal case was opened under Article 126 of the Criminal Code...\"], 'applicants': ['ABAYEVA', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '13', '2', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '2', '13', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['20', '21', '22', '53', '57', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '81']}, 'silver_rationales': [15, 16, 17, 48, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [15, 16, 17, 48, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'explained_indices': [1, 0, 3, 2, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 40, 48, 39, 38, 37, 36, 41, 49, 51, 35, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 50, 34, 32, 64, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 33, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 18, 65], 'explained_distances': [0.20406324, 0.1546995, 0.03755015, 0.035535216, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119, 0.022331119], 'number_of_sentences': 66, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants, who are all siblings, were born in 1939, 1927, 1934, 1931, 1924, 1949 and 1949, respectively. They live in Tirana and Vlora.', '6.  During the communist regime several plots of land owned by the applicants’ parents had been confiscated by the authorities without compensation. The property measuring in total 132 hectares was situated in the Vlora region on the southern Albanian coast.', '7.  On 30 March 1994, pursuant to the Property Act, the applicants lodged a request with the Vlora Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit të Pronave, “the Vlora Commission”) seeking the allocation of the original property to them.', '8.  On 27 August 1996 the Vlora Commission assigned to the applicants jointly, as co-owners, 14 hectares (2 hectares per person) of the property (“relevant property”). The decision was signed by four out of the seven members of the Vlora Commission.', '9.  Notwithstanding this, and based on the Commission’s decision, on an unspecified date the applicants registered the relevant property with the Vlora Land Registry.', '10.  On 28 December 1998 they applied to the Vlora Commission requesting the issuance of a new document complying with formal legal requirements, namely, a document duly signed by all of the Commission’s members.', '11.  On 6 January 1999, by document no. 76, the President of the Vlora Commission replied to the applicants, informing them that the Commission had already confirmed their title in its decision of 27 August 1996. In any event, pursuant to the laws in force at the material time, competence for any formal correction of the Commission’s documents lay with the courts.', '12.  On 25 November 1996 the Ministry of Tourism, by decree no 20/2, (“the decree”), leased a plot of land (part of the applicants’ property) to A.L., for tourism purposes.', '13.  On 29 December 1997 the applicants brought an action before the Tirana District Court to quash the decree.', '14.  On 17 February 1998 the Tirana District Court annulled the decree on the ground that the transaction concerned private property.', '15.  On 16 June 1998 the Tirana Court of Appeal quashed the District Court’s decision and upheld the validity of the decree, stating that the Commission’s decision of 27 August 1996 had been invalid in that it had not complied with formal requirements. Consequently, the applicants could not claim title to the relevant property.', '16.  On 10 June 1999, following an appeal by the applicants, the Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 16 June 1998 on the ground that it had been illogical and sent the case back to the Court of Appeal for re-hearing.', '17.  On 10 November 1999 the Tirana Court of Appeal, following a re-hearing, rejected the applicants’ action on the ground that it had been lodged with the District Court after the one-month time-limit stipulated by law had expired.', '18.  On 17 January 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment.', '19.  Meanwhile, on 9 October 1997 the Vlora Commission allocated to K.B. - A.L.’s mother - as compensation, the same plot of land that the Ministry had previously leased to her son.', '20.  On an unspecified date K.B donated the land to her son.', '21.  Following a request by A.L., by order no. 3 dated 11 June 1999, the Vlora Land Registry cancelled the applicants’ title to this plot of land and registered A.L. as the owner.', '22.  On 13 December 1999, following a civil action brought by A.L., the Vlora District Court declared null and void the Vlora Commission’s decision of 27 August 1996 which had allocated the ownership of the plot of land to the applicants on the ground that it had not been issued in compliance with formal requirements (see the findings of the Tirana Court of Appeal decision of 16 June 1998).', '23.  On 17 March 2000 the Vlora Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s decision and reasoning, adding that the Vlora Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction in taking decisions about properties which the State had assigned for tourism purposes.', '24.  On 17 January 2001 the Supreme Court confirmed that the Vlora Commission’s decision was null and void, on the ground that it had not been issued in compliance with formal requirements. It was consequently of no effect as regards the applicants or other third parties. Notwithstanding this, it quashed the judgments given at first and second instance and discontinued the proceedings.', '25.  On 18 April 2000 the applicants initiated proceedings with the Vlora District Court seeking the annulment of the decision of the Vlora Commission in K.B.’s favour. On 6 February 2001 the Vlora District Court dismissed the applicants’ request on the ground that the Vlora Commission’s decision in their favour had been declared null and void by the Vlora District Court’s decision of 13 December 1999.', '26.  On 25 May 2001 the Vlora Court of Appeal, having examined the applicants’ appeal, rejected the applicants’ argument as to the nullity of the Commission’s decision allocating the land to K.B. on the ground that it was unsubstantiated. It also rejected their second request, holding that an irregular act, even if not considered formally invalid, as in this case, should not have any legal effect.', '27.  On 6 March 2003 the Supreme Court quashed the first and second instance decisions in part. It dismissed the applicants’ request for a declaration that the Vlora Commission’s decision allocating the plot of land to K.B. was null and void, on the ground that its nullity could only be determined once a valid decision determining the applicants’ rights over the land had been taken. It accordingly ordered the Vlora Commission to issue a decision vis-a-vis the applicants in compliance with the formal requirements.', '28.  On 14 April 2004 the Vlora District Court, upon a request by the applicants, issued an enforcement order instructing the Vlora Commission to comply with the Supreme Court’s judgment of 6 March 2003.', '29.  On 10 May and 2 September 2004 the Commission informed the Bailiffs’ Office that they had not issued the decision ordered in the Supreme Court judgment due to the fact that the applicants had failed to submit the documents necessary to enable a legally correct decision to be taken.', '30.  On 27 August 2004 the Bailiffs’ Office once again brought to the Vlora Commission’s attention the enforcement order issued on 14 April 2004.', '31.  On 12 May and 6 September 2004 the Bailiffs’ Office invited the applicants to comply with the Commission’s requests and to submit the documents relating to their property claims.', '32.  The applicants then informed the Bailiffs’ Office and the Vlora Commission that they had already submitted the necessary documents at the time the Commission had decided in 1996. Moreover, they were reluctant to submit the requested documents since they disagreed with any suggestion that their case had to be decided ex novo.

It would appear from the case file that the salient fact in the domestic proceedings was the applicant’s association with the mujahedin in Bosnia and Herzegovina (“BH”)[1]. The term mujahedin has been widely used to refer to foreigners – mainly from the Arab world – who came to BH during the war in support of Bosnian Muslims[2]. However, the same term has been used to describe local Muslims who joined the foreign mujahedin, endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing. The phenomenon has been explained by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (“ICTY”) in Hadžihasanović and Kubura, IT-01-47-T, §§ 411‑18, 15 March 2006, and Delić, IT-04-83-T, §§ 166-199, 15 September 2008, as follows.', '7.  The first foreign mujahedin arrived in BH in the summer of 1992 via Croatia and with the assistance of the Croatian authorities. It would appear that their arrival was welcomed by the BH authorities. While the presence of at least some foreign mujahedin seems to have been motivated by a desire to provide humanitarian assistance to the Bosnian Muslim population, most of them actively supported the military struggle against the Bosnian Muslims’ adversaries, ready to conduct a jihad or “holy war”. As stated by Ali Hamad, an ICTY witness of Bahraini origin who came to BH in 1992, some of the mujahedin were members of al-Qaeda who had the aim of “creating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations”. Some of them also came to perform missionary work.', '8.  Upon arrival, foreign mujahedin settled in various locations and did not form a homogeneous entity. Towards the end of 1992, Bosnian Muslims started to join the foreign mujahedin. The locals were provided with military training and participated in combat action. They were also given religious instruction. A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active. Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other, it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities. There were religious and ideological differences between them, which resulted in occasional violent clashes.', '9.  On 13 August 1993 the foreign mujahedin were organised into a unit within the local ARBH (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) forces[3]. The unit, named “El Mujahedin”, was based in Zenica. Following its establishment, the unit significantly grew in size. By 1995, it consisted of around 1,000 fighters. Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only, locals soon outnumbered its foreign members. The factors that motivated locals to join it included: its stricter regimental discipline; a better degree of organisation; superior equipment and combat morale; its religious dedication; and material benefits. The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the Islamic world, including the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation[4] and the Benevolence International Foundation[5]. The Islamic Cultural Institute in Milan provided logistical support.', '10.  El Mujahedin had a number of features setting it apart from regular ARBH units. It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ARBH. At the top of the hierarchy was an emir, who has been described as the highest-ranking person within the unit. Abu Haris, a Libyan, was its first emir. In December 1993, he was succeeded by an Algerian, Abu Maali, who remained in that position until the end of the war. A different person from the emir, the military commander, headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations. In 1993, this post was held by an Egyptian named Vahidin or Wahiuddin. After his death in October 1993, another Egyptian, Muatez, succeeded him. Muatez was killed in September 1995. The unit had a religious council, the shura, which was its supreme decision-making body. It consisted of approximately twenty prominent members of the unit, mostly of Arab origin. The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura. At the end of 1994, Sheikh Shaban joined the leadership of the unit. He was the head of the Islamic Cultural Institute in Milan and known to be an extremist who was well-connected with Islamic fundamentalists all over the world (the ICTY relied in that regard on a judgment of the Milan Criminal Court of 1 January 2006). He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from Arab countries for the struggle in BH. Although Sheikh Shaban did not hold an official function within the unit, its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit. He could issue binding rulings (fatwa) and his authority was never challenged by the shura. Sheikh Shaban was killed, together with Abu Haris, at an HVO (Croatian Defence Council)[6] military checkpoint on 14 December 1995.', '11.  The General Framework Agreement for Peace, which ended the war in BH, was initialled at a military base near Dayton, the United States, on 21 November 1995 and signed in Paris, France, on 14 December 1995. Article III of Annex 1A to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States, irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces. In view of that, on 14 December 1995 the ARBH disbanded El Mujahedin and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by 10 January 1996. Despite initial resistance, the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded. It would appear that awards, such as the “Golden Lily”, were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave. Members of the unit were also provided with ARBH certificates of service, which assisted its foreign members to acquire BH citizenship. Whereas most of the unit’s foreign members left BH, some of them (such as the present applicant) applied for BH citizenship and continue to live in BH to date.', '12.  After the attacks of 11 September 2001, the official attitude towards foreign mujahedin changed dramatically. Many lost their BH citizenship or were deported from BH after being declared a threat to national security.', '13.  The applicant was born in Iraq in 1960.', '14.  He went to Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue his studies in 1979. He first studied in Sarajevo and in 1983 moved to Zenica. In 1987 the applicant married a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have five children together.', '15.  During the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the applicant joined El Mujahedin unit mentioned above.', '16.  The applicant acquired citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“BH citizenship”) on three occasions: on 23 March 1992, on 12 January 1995 (under the name of Awad Fadhil) and again on 20 February 1995. He has visited Iraq twice since the 1992-95 war, in 2003 and 2004. The applicant possesses an Iraqi passport, issued by the Iraqi Embassy in Vienna on 23 January 2007, which was valid until 22 January 2011.', '17. On 30 August 2006 the competent administrative authorities established that the applicant’s BH citizenship had been acquired by means of fraudulent conduct, false information and concealment of some relevant facts (notably, the fact that he already possessed BH citizenship when he lodged the second application for naturalisation and that he had used documents issued in two different names) and quashed the decisions of 23 March 1992 and 20 February 1995. On 12 January 2007 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the State Court”) quashed the part of the decision of 30 August 2006 concerning the decision of 20 February 1995 and remitted the case for retrial.', '18.  Meanwhile, on 6 June 2007 the applicant filed a request for a temporary residence permit. On 28 September 2007 the Aliens Service suspended those proceedings pending the final resolution of the applicant’s citizenship status.', '19.  On 27 November 2008 the competent administrative authorities quashed the decision of 20 February 1995 again. On 3 December 2009 the State Court upheld that decision. On 1 February 2010 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”). It appears that those proceedings are still pending. This does not, however, prevent the applicant’s potential deportation, as he became an unlawful resident from the moment of the notification of the decision of 27 November 2008. The applicant, on the other hand, claimed that he still possesses BH citizenship based on a decision of 12 January 1995 (see paragraph 16 above). That decision was, however, issued in the name of another person (Awad Fadhil) and cannot, therefore, confer any rights on the applicant, as was confirmed in the Government’s observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.', '20.   On 23 June 2009 the Aliens Service established that the applicant was a threat to national security and placed him in Istočno Sarajevo Immigration Centre. It relied on secret intelligence reports. On 30 June 2009 the State Court, having assessed the secret evidence, upheld that decision. On 17 September 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. The initial detention period had been extended on a monthly basis until April 2011 when the applicant was released (see paragraph 26 below).', '21.  After the decision revoking the applicant’s citizenship of 27 November 2008 had become final, the proceedings before the Aliens Service concerning a request for a temporary residence permit were resumed at the applicant’s request (see paragraph 18 above). On 8 January 2010 the Aliens Service refused his request and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. On 2 March 2010 the Ministry of Security upheld that decision. On 1 June 2010 the State Court upheld the decision of 2 March 2010. On 21 April 2011 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court. It would appear that those proceedings are still pending.', '22.  On 17 February 2010 the applicant claimed asylum. He maintained that Iraqi citizens who had joined the foreign mujahedin during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were treated in Iraq as suspected terrorists and were subjected to ill-treatment. He added that his friend had informed him that his name was on a “black list” and that his family was subjected to threats and ill-treatment due to their affiliation with the Ba’ath Party. The applicant also claimed that he would be persecuted by Shia Muslims and Kurds upon his return to Iraq (Kirkuk) because he is a Sunni Muslim.', '23.  On 23 February 2010 the Asylum Service interviewed the applicant in the presence of his lawyer and a UNHCR representative. It also had regard to reports of the US Department of State, the UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration and the UK Border Agency on Iraq. At the interview the applicant stated that he has visited Iraq twice since the change of regime, in 2003 and 2004. During both visits he stayed with his family in Kirkuk. In 2003 he went to visit his sick father and stayed for one and a half months. He took care of his father and accompanied him to the hospital on several occasions. In 2004 the applicant went to Kirkuk to hold a commemoration for his father and remained there for the whole month of Ramadan and the Bayram holiday. However, he claimed that during these visits he had been forced to hide in fear of the Kurdish authorities as his friend had told him that he was under surveillance and that his name was on a “black list”. The applicant further claimed that in his subsequent contact with his family, after he had returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina, they had told him that the Kurds had searched their home looking for him. On 4 March 2010 the Asylum Service refused the asylum claim and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. The Asylum Service held that the applicant’s statements were contradictory and that he had not provided any evidence in support of his claims.', '24.  On 26 May 2010 the State Court quashed that decision and remitted the case for a retrial stating that the Asylum Service should make a more thorough assessment of the applicant’s claim. On 21 June 2010 the Asylum Service refused the applicant’s request for asylum and granted him a period for voluntary departure of fifteen days. On 22 September 2010 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina upheld that decision. On 19 November 2010 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court against that decision. On 9 February 2011 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. It held that, although the general situation in Iraq was insecure and problematic, the applicant had not proved that there was a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention on account of his personal circumstances.', '25.  On 8 November 2010 the Aliens Service issued a deportation order accompanied with an entry ban for a period of five years. It stated, however, that removal directions would not be issued for as long as the Court’s interim measure was in force. On 3 December 2010 the Ministry of Security upheld that decision. On 16 March 2011 the State Court also upheld the deportation order. An appeal is pending before the Constitutional Court.', '26.  On 5 April 2011 the State Court ordered the applicant’s immediate release from the immigration centre, quashing the last extension order (of 21 March 2011) as unlawful. It held that the relevant authorities had not provided any new evidence as a basis for the applicant’s continued detention. Furthermore, it prescribed the lesser measure of surveillance limiting the applicant’s freedom of movement to his home address in Zenica with the obligation to report daily to the Aliens Service field office in Zenica. It also ordered the confiscation of the applicant’s Iraqi passport and other personal documents he might use in an attempt to leave the country.

The applicant association is dedicated to animal protection, campaigning in particular against animal experiments and battery farming.', '5.  In response to various advertisements produced by the meat industry, the applicant association made a television commercial lasting fifty-five seconds, consisting of two scenes.\\nThe first scene showed a sow building a shelter for her piglets in the forest. With soft music playing in the background, the voiceover referred, among other things, to the pigs’ sense of family. The second scene showed a noisy hall with pigs in small pens, gnawing nervously at the iron bars. The voiceover compared the conditions in which pigs were reared to concentration camps, and added that the animals were pumped full of medicines. The film concluded with the exhortation: “Eat less meat, for the sake of your health, the animals and the environment!”', '6.  Permission to broadcast the commercial on the channels of the Swiss Radio and Television Company (Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft) was refused on 24 January 1994 by the company responsible for television advertising (the Commercial Television Company (AG für das Werbefernsehen), now called Publisuisse SA) and, at final instance, by the Federal Court, which dismissed an administrative-law appeal by the applicant association on 20 August 1997.\\nIn respect of the applicant association’s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention, the Federal Court found that the prohibition of political advertising laid down in section 18(5) of the Federal Radio and Television Act pursued various aims; in particular, it was designed to prevent financially powerful groups from obtaining a competitive political advantage, to protect the formation of public opinion from undue commercial influence, to bring about a certain equality of opportunity among the different forces of society, and to contribute towards the independence of radio and television broadcasters in editorial matters.', '7.  On 13 July 1994 the applicant association lodged an application with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention.', '8.  The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).', '9.  In a decision of 6 April 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.', '10.  In a judgment of 28 June 2001 the Court held that the refusal by the relevant Swiss authorities to broadcast the commercial in question infringed the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention (see VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no. 24699/94, ECHR 2001‑VI).\\nThe Court found that the measure taken had been “prescribed by law” and had pursued a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 10 § 2.\\nAs to whether the measure had been “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of that provision, the Court noted, in particular, that it had not been established that the applicant association itself constituted a powerful financial group pursuing the aim of restricting the broadcaster’s independence, unduly influencing public opinion or endangering equality of opportunity among the different forces of society. On the contrary, it had simply intended to participate in an ongoing general debate on the protection and rearing of animals. Accordingly, in the Court’s opinion, the authorities had not demonstrated in a “relevant and sufficient” manner why the grounds generally advanced in support of the prohibition of political advertising could also serve to justify the interference in the particular circumstances of the case (ibid., § 75).\\nThe Court also found that there had been no violation of Articles 13 and 14 of the Convention. As to the application of Article 41, it ordered Switzerland to pay 20,000 Swiss francs (CHF – approximately 12,160 euros (EUR) today) for costs and expenses. However, it made no award to the applicant association for non-pecuniary damage.', '11.  Subsequently, the applicant association again applied to Publisuisse SA for permission to broadcast an amended version of the commercial. In a letter of 30 November 2001 Publisuisse SA refused the application.', '12.  On 1 December 2001, on the basis of the Court’s judgment, the applicant association applied to the Federal Court for the final judgment given at domestic level to be reviewed, in accordance with section 139a of the former Federal Judicature Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, paragraph 19 below).', '13.  In their respective observations of 10 January and 15 February 2002, which were duly transmitted to the applicant association, the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication and the Swiss Radio and Television Company submitted that the application to reopen the proceedings should be dismissed.', '14.  In a judgment of 29 April 2002 the Federal Court dismissed the application to reopen the proceedings. It held that the applicant association had not provided a sufficient explanation of the nature of “the amendment of the judgment and the redress being sought”, a formal requirement imposed by section 140 of the former Federal Judicature Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, paragraph 20 below). It observed, in particular, that the applicant association had been unable to show how redress was possible only through the reopening of the proceedings. It further noted that the association had not sufficiently shown that it still had an interest in broadcasting the original commercial, which now appeared out of date almost eight years after it was initially intended to have been broadcast. Lastly, the Federal Court considered that the fact that Publisuisse SA, the competent authority in such matters, had again refused to sign an agreement to broadcast an amended version of the commercial should have formed the subject of separate proceedings.', '15.  On 3 March 2003 the Federal Office of Communication dismissed an appeal by the applicant association against Publisuisse SA’s decision of 30 November 2001 refusing permission to broadcast the amended version of the commercial.', '16.

The court had reviewed the applicant’s case and granted his application in part. It had reclassified the charges as simple kidnapping. The sentence, however, had remained unaffected.', '11.  On 7 August 2001 the applicant was arrested, together with Mr T. and Mr Z., by officers of the Organised Crime Unit on suspicion of extortion.', '12.  On 10 August 2001 the applicant was formally charged and remanded in custody.', '13.  On 21 January 2002 the Kurgan Town Court of the Kurgan Region convicted the applicant and Mr Z. of extortion and sentenced the former to six years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.', '14.  On 26 March 2002 the Kurgan Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal.', '15.  According to the applicant, on 7 August 2001 during and after the arrest he was beaten up by the police officers.', '16.  On 8 August 2001 the applicant was placed in the temporary detention facility (ИВС) located within the police station. On admission he was examined by an officer on duty and a paramedic, who did not observe any injuries on his body. The applicant did not bring an oral or written complaint about the alleged beatings.', '17.  On 10 August 2001 the applicant was transferred to remand centre no. 43/1 of Kurgan. On arrival he was examined by a general practitioner who noted several bruises in the lumbar region measuring 1 by 1 cm and 3 by 2 cm. A relevant entry was made in the applicant’s medical file.', '18.  It appears that on the same day the administration of the remand centre prepared a report concerning the applicant’s injuries and forwarded all the relevant materials to the prosecutor’s office for further inquiry. According to a certificate issued by the remand centre on 16 August 2007, the copies of those materials stored at the remand prison had been destroyed after the expiry of the time-limit for their storage on 20 January 2006 and 27 March 2007.', '19.  On 5 March 2002 the applicant complained to the Kurgan Regional Prosecutor that he had been beaten up by police officers on 7 August 2001.', '20.  On 27 March 2002 the deputy prosecutor of Kurgan issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. The prosecutor based his findings on the statements made by the alleged perpetrators, who denied the applicant’s allegations, and the medical documents from the applicant’s file. In particular the prosecutor stated as follows:\\n“The inquiry conducted did not confirm the [applicant’s] allegations. The police officers Ch., M. and K. ... denied that they had put any pressure on [the applicant]. Upon arrival at [the temporary detention facility], he did not complain that he had been beaten up by the police officers... According to [the applicant’s] medical file, upon his arrival at [the remand centre]... several bruises were noted in the lumbar spine area. However, according to the certificate, issued by the head of [the temporary detention facility], upon his placement [there] [the applicant] had been examined and questioned by an officer on duty as to whether he had any injuries. [The applicant] had not complained of his condition or had any visible injuries. Nor had the results of the applicant’s examination by a paramedic on 8 August 2001 been any different. When transferred to [the remand centre], [the applicant] did not complain of his condition either. Accordingly, the injuries noted at [the remand centre] cannot have been caused by the [police officers] in the circumstances described by [the applicant].”', '21.  The applicant complained to a court, claiming that the scope of the prosecutor’s inquiry had been insufficient because he had never been interviewed by a prosecutor with regard to his allegations of ill-treatment.', '22.  On 31 December 2002 the Kurgan Town Court upheld the prosecutor’s decision, finding that the scope of the inquiry had been adequate given the lack of evidence supporting the applicant’s allegation of ill-treatment. In particular, the court found as follows:\\n“The Kurgan prosecutor’s office carried out a proper investigation into the allegations concerning the use of unlawful investigation techniques by the police officers. Messrs M., Ch., and K. were questioned. They explained that they had not put any physical or psychological pressure on [the applicant] during his arrest. [The applicant] did not confess to the crime. It is true that on [10] August 2001 after his transfer from [the temporary detention facility] to [the remand prison] bruises on the small of [the applicant’s] back were detected. However, earlier, when [the applicant] had been brought to [the temporary detention facility], he had been examined and questioned by an officer on duty. At that time [the applicant] had no injuries and did not complain of the alleged ill-treatment or his condition. Having regard to those facts, the Kurgan prosecutor’s office drew a justified conclusion that the [bruises] detected upon the applicant’s arrival at [the remand prison] could not have been caused by the policemen in the circumstances described by [the applicant]. There are no other materials in the court’s possession to prove that the policemen had committed any unlawful acts vis-à-vis [the applicant].”', '23.  On 1 July 2003 the Kurgan Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision.'], 'applicants': ['YEVGENIY KORNEV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['17', '18'], '6': ['25']}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 13], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 13], 'explained_indices': [3, 2, 1, 0, 6, 4, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 18, 17, 5, 11, 7, 8, 10, 9], 'explained_distances': [0.20374465, 0.19462067, 0.11969279, 0.11228606, 0.075951874, 0.061228886, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.05354023, 0.019285649, 0.0069411695, 0.0004377067, -0.027315438, -0.1141434, -0.124681056], 'number_of_sentences': 19, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant company publishes a weekly newspaper Ivanovo-Press. The two individual applicants are journalists writing for the newspaper.', '6.  On 12 August 2003 the Ivanovo-press newspaper published in issue no. 32 an article by Ms L. headlined “You can see it – and you can have it” («И око видит, и зуб ймет») about a conflict between Mr K., director of the local State gas-supply company “Rodnikiraygas”, and his neighbours, the S. family. The article had the following subtitles: “The Director of Rodnikiraygas has declared war on a poverty-stricken family, not a single member of which is healthy”, “Boss in Law”, “Gas Racket”. It also stated that Mr K. had “ordered that the S. family not be supplied with gas”, and that “even when all the notified defects had been eradicated ... [Mr K.] did not lift the unofficial ban”. Finally, in the article Mr K. was described as “a parochial boss”.', '7.  Mr K. instituted defamation proceedings before the Leninskiy District Court of Ivanovo against the applicant company and Ms L. He requested the court to order a rectification of the above statements, all the subtitles and the headline of the article.', '8.  On 18 December 2003 the District Court found in part against the applicant company. In particular, it established that the S. family had not been supplied with gas on account of defects in their compressed gas equipment, and that the gas supply had been restored as soon as these defects were rectified. Thus, the statements that Mr K. had “ordered that the S. family not be supplied with gas”, and that “even when all the notified defects had been eradicated ... [Mr K.] did not lift the unofficial ban” were untrue.', '9.  With regard to the subtitle “The Director of Rodnikiraygas has declared war on a poverty-stricken family ...” the District Court found that “the fact that Mr K. [had] lodged a civil claim against Ms S. does not constitute evidence of a declaration of war”, and the plaintiff’s claim in this part was allowed.', '10.  The District Court further rejected the defendant’s argument that the subtitles “Boss in Law” and “Gas Racket” were value-judgments, not susceptible of proof. It stated that the expression “boss in law” («начальник в законе») was analogous to the Russian slang expression “thief in law” and could not have any other meaning. The word “racket” («рэкет») meant an outrageous extortion, and, used together with the word “gas” in a subtitle to the article about Mr K., who was the director of a gas supply company, implied, in the court’s view, that the plaintiff was extorting a property by threats and blackmail.', '11.  The court rejected the remainder of the claim, finding that the headline of the article was merely a rephrased Russian proverb which did not contain any information about Mr K. It found that the expression “a parochial boss” could not be regarded as defamatory.', '12.  The court held the applicant company liable to pay 3,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in compensation to Mr K. and RUB 515 in legal aid.', '13.  On 17 March 2004 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld that judgment in a summary fashion.', '14.  In 2003, a series of articles critical of Mr V., who was the head of the Ivanovo Regional Highways Department and of the Executive Committee of the Ivanovo Regional Branch of the United Russia party, appeared in the Ivanovo-Press newspaper.', '15.  On 15 July 2003 the newspaper published an interview with Mr Ku., the former general director of a public company. Mr Ku. stated that in 1996 Mr V. had tricked him into signing a contract with a private company which had subsequently defaulted on its obligations. Mr Ku. stated in particular that Mr V. “was capable of violating moral principles for the sake of money and [his] career”.', '16.  On 29 July 2003 the newspaper published an article under the headline “V. wants a market, WE NEED VICTORY Sq.” («В-у нужен базар, НАМ – пл. ПОБЕДЫ») followed by a subheading “The head of the Executive Committee of the Ivanovo Regional Branch of the United Russia party, V., is ready to convert Victory Square into a market place”. The article criticised the authorities’ neglectful attitude towards the veterans of the Second World War, as exemplified by the attempts of some officials to build a shopping centre and car park in Victory Square. The article continued as follows:\\n“Cynically, loudly, shamelessly and in disregard of public opinion, Mr V., the head of [the Ivanovo Regional Highways Department] and of the Executive Committee of the Ivanovo Regional Branch of the United Russia Party, has been lobbying town officials for the building of a shopping centre, parking places, etc. in one of the town’s central squares (Victory Square, the name so dear to the majority of its inhabitants) ...\\nFor the sake of transient personal interests of gluttonous nouveaux riches some officials from the town administration are ready to sacrifice (supposedly for a fee) the glory and pride of generations and to devalue and belittle such notions as ‘Patriotism’, ‘Victory’ and ‘Faith’. Mr V.’s unscrupulousness, the dubious origins of his wealth and financial resources, and his readiness to transgress all moral laws to secure his wealth have been known for a long time. His attempts to persuade the town administration to build a shopping centre in the central square seem even more suspicious ... People like V. have so far created nothing, done nothing for their fellow townsmen. Not only that, the activity of the above-mentioned official has brought nothing but harm. He worked in the position of general director of the Polet company and the company lost eighteen billion [Russian roubles]. He became the head of [the Ivanovo Regional Highways Department] and got money for serious commercial projects ... The leaders of [the United Russia party] (V. is one of them) lack wisdom, will, aspiration to promote unity in society by renouncing, at least temporarily, their ambitions and passion for wealth ...” (underlining added, see below).', '17.  Mr V. sued the applicant company and the author of the article in defamation before the Leninskiy District Court. Considering that the article’s headline, subheading and the extracts underlined above were untrue and damaging to his dignity and professional reputation, he sought rectification.', '18.  The applicant company maintained that all the statements of fact contained in the article were true as proved by witness testimony. The other statements were value judgements and could not be proved.', '19.  On 23 December 2003 the District Court granted Mr V.’s action in part. It found that the underlined extracts were damaging to Mr V.’s honour, dignity and reputation as they contained allegations that Mr V. had breached moral and ethical norms, had behaved unscrupulously, cynically and in disregard of public opinion, and that his activity had been harmful. The defendants had not proved the veracity of those statements.', '20.  In respect of Mr V.’s allegedly dishonest dealings with Mr Ku.’s public company, the District Court found that the testimony of Mr Ku., who was hostile towards Mr V., was insufficient to prove the truthfulness of the allegation that Mr V. had acted unscrupulously in that matter or that his activity had been harmful.', '21.  With regard to Mr V.’s alleged intention to convert Victory Square into a market place, the District Court noted that the fact that he had repeatedly attempted to obtain building permission had been confirmed by Mr G.’s testimony. However, no evidence had been adduced to suggest that he had done so cynically or in disregard of public opinion.', '22.  The District Court accordingly found that the underlined extracts were untrue, damaging to Mr V.’s honour, dignity and professional reputation and were liable to rectification. It accepted, however, that the statements which are not underlined were the author’s subjective opinion and not susceptible of proof.', '23.  Both the applicant company and Mr V. appealed.', '24.  On 17 March 2004 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld part of the judgment and quashed the remainder. The Regional Court agreed with the District Court’s findings that the underlined statements were untrue and damaging to the plaintiff’s honour and reputation. The Regional Court noted in addition:\\n“The defendants failed to prove the truthfulness of their allegation that V. had lobbied for the development of Victory Square. The testimony by witness G[.] that the plaintiff had twice discussed with him the issue of building a car park in front of the Polet company does not confirm [the truthfulness of that allegation]. Judging by the meaning of the word ‘to lobby’ (to apply pressure in order to obtain a certain decision), an application to a competent official cannot be regarded as lobbying for the building of a shopping centre in Victory Square.”\\nAccordingly, the Regional Court upheld the part of the judgment concerning the underlined statements. That part of the judgment became final.', '25.  It quashed the part of the judgment concerning the statements which are not underlined and remitted the case to the Leninskiy District Court for re-examination for the following reasons:\\n“The court considers that the arguments by the plaintiff’s counsel about the defamatory character of the phrase ‘V. wants a market, WE WANT VICTORY Sq.’ and other phrases are well-founded. These phrases contain statements about the facts which have allegedly taken place: ‘attempted to persuade’, ‘is ready to convert the square’, ‘V. wants a market’. In these circumstances the court cannot agree with the [District] Court’s finding that these statements are value judgements of the author of the publication.”', '26.  On 13 April 2004 the Leninskiy District Court re-examined the outstanding part of the case. If found that the headline and subheading of the article and the statement that “his attempts to persuade the town administration to build a shopping centre in the central square seem ... more suspicious” were damaging to Mr V.’s honour, dignity and professional reputation as they contained allegations that he had breached moral and ethical norms and had belittled the memory of the veterans of the Second World War.', '27.  Mr V. then sued the applicant company and Ms L. for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage and legal costs. On 16 June 2004 the Leninskiy District Court allowed the claims in part and ordered the applicant company to pay Mr V. RUB 4,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus legal costs. On 26 July 2004 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld that judgment on appeal.', '28.  On 11 January 2005 the Ivanovo-Press newspaper printed an article by the applicant Mr Smetanin under the headline “Five pairs of underwear for three years” («Пять трусов на три года»). He expressed his dissatisfaction with the existing level of salaries and social security in the Ivanovo Region and precariousness of the job market. The applicant criticised the governor of the Ivanovo Region for a lack of attention to those issues, writing as follows:\\n“In the meantime, at the children’s new year party the governor talked about his cherished dream to find a life companion in 2005. He does not think about the people but solely about himself. He was married twice and is now searching yet again. The entire region is gossiping about him and Ms D. but he does not care. He continues to turn us into zombies ...\\nWhen electing him, [we] expected that a Communist would care about the people. But he turned out to be a simple demagogue! ...\\nThe governor now claims that he is certain to be re-appointed for a second term with a probability of 67 per cent. Did you ask the people’s opinion? The people have faith in the president but, in my view, if he decides to re-appoint the individuals who brought discredit upon themselves, the residents of the Ivanovo region would not appreciate it!”', '29.  The article was accompanied by a photograph showing two men, one of whom appears to be the governor of the Ivanovo Region. The photograph carried the following caption: “In my view, these men do not give a damn about anyone as long as [their] pockets are full of money and [they have] a cute babe close by.”', '30.  The governor Mr T. and the deputy head of the governor’s administration Ms D. sued the first and second applicants for defamation. They claimed that the above-cited extracts and the caption under the photograph damaged their dignity, honour and reputation.', '31.  On 31 March 2005 the Leninskiy District Court gave judgment and granted the claim in part.', '32.  The District Court found, firstly, that the applicants failed to prove the allegation that the governor was an individual who “brought discredit upon [himself]”. It held as follows:\\n“The respondents did not produce any evidence showing the veracity of the said statements. A copy of the Ivanovskaya Zemlya newspaper of 17 March 2005, in which the campaign ‘For the Ivanovo Region without [governor] T.!’ was launched and the signatures collected against the re-appointment of Mr T. for a second term may not be such evidence, similarly to any other newspaper publications. The veracity of the statements printed in the newspaper and participation of the listed organisation in the campaign has not been established by anyone. The publication in the Ivanovskaya Zemlya newspaper of 17 March 2005 only demonstrates the existence of political struggle for the governor’s position.”', '33.  The District Court further considered that the extract concerning the governor’s personal relationships – starting from “He does not think ...” and to the end of the paragraph – contained the assertions that he had favoured his private life to the detriment of the social and economic development of the region, neglected his professional duties, engaged in an extra-marital relationship with Ms D. and also attempted to turn the people of the region into “zombies”. The District Court pointed out that the applicants failed to produce any evidence in support of those allegations which were damaging to the reputation of both the governor and Ms D.', '34.  Referring to Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court (cited in paragraph 54 below), the District Court also found that the caption of the photograph was not actionable in defamation because it expressed the author’s personal opinion and because it did not refer directly to Ms D.', '35.  The District Court held that the applicant company should pay RUB 20,000 to the governor and RUB 15,000 to Ms D. and the applicant Mr Smetanin RUB 5,000 and RUB 3,000, respectively. It also ordered publication of the entire judgment by way of rectification.', '36.  On 11 May 2005 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal, in a summary fashion.', '37.  Between September 2004 and January 2005 the Ivanovo-Press newspaper published a series of articles which criticised the management of the Ivanovo Regional Social Security Fund by its director Ms S. In connection with those publications Ms S. lodged two defamation claims before the Leninskiy District Court of Ivanovo.', '38.  On 4 March 2005 the Leninskiy District Court issued judgment in the first defamation claim, in which the applicant company and the applicant Mr Smetanin were the defendants.', '39.  The District Court found, firstly, that the headline of the article by the applicant Mr Smetanin entitled “Shady organisations stand up for S.” («За С-ву заступаются теневые структуры») printed in issue no. 39 of 28 September 2004, was damaging for her reputation. The article concerned a visit that the director of the Zabota foundation Mr L. had paid to the newspaper’s office to express his discontent about the negative coverage of Ms S.’s activities in previous publications. Examined in the witness stand, Mr L. testified that the Zabota foundation had been set up to assist orphaned children, the disabled and rehabilitated criminals and that one half of the foundation’s employees were former convicts. He stated that he had had professional contacts with Ms S. and had sought her assistance in obtaining holiday vouchers for orphaned children. Exasperated by the aspersions the newspaper had cast on Ms S., he had come to the office and had spoken to the editor-in-chief. The District Court determined that, in the absence of any evidence of the Zabota foundation’s involvement in criminal or illegal activities, the allegation contained in the article’s headline was untrue.', '40.  Secondly, the District Court considered the assertions made by the applicant Mr Smetanin in the article “Sports, children’s holidays and corruption” («Спорт, детский отдых и коррупция») printed in issue no. 40 of 5 October 2004. The article alleged in particular that Ms S. had “earned a fortune by simply siphoning off a large part of funds through an acquaintance of hers” and that “for a long time those amounts [had been] used to feed bandits and double-faced policemen who cover[ed] up for her”. The District Court examined Ms U., who was Ms S.’s “acquaintance” mentioned in the article, and two employees of the social-security fund, but found no evidence of any misappropriations or unlawful transfer of funds. Accordingly, it concluded that the allegations were untrue and damaging for Ms S.’s reputation.', '41.  Thirdly, the District Court examined two extracts from an article by the applicant Mr Smetanin published in issue no. 42 of 19 October 2004 and found as follows:\\n“The assertions that S. had made fun of [President] Putin and that S. hides her real face from public are also damaging to the plaintiff’s reputation ...\\nThe sentence ‘T. S. hides her real face from the public’ contains in fact an assertion that the plaintiff is double-faced and has a different, genuine face which she hides from the public. This conclusion finds corroboration in the submissions by the representative of the defendants who stated in court that the purpose of that figure of speech was to inform the readers that there were not just positive but also negative aspects to the plaintiff’s reputation. According to [the authoritative dictionary of Russian language], the word ‘two-faced’ means something that presents two contradictory aspects, hypocritical, insincere. No evidence showing the veracity of those statements was submitted to the court. The prosecutor’s office discontinued criminal case no. 3025 against Ms S. for lack of indications of the criminal offences under Article 285 and 160 of the Criminal Code. The reports by [the auditing authorities] do not contain any such evidence, either.\\nAccording to the same dictionary, the expression ‘make fun’ of someone (the same as ‘laugh at’) means to ridicule or scorn something or somebody; the article concerns the disrespect of legal requirements and incompliance with the Presidential Decree [which required State officials to render assistance to journalists in obtaining exact and truthful information]. ... The plaintiff clarified in court that her refusal to give out information about the employees of the social security fund had been prompted by written petitions from the fund employees who had objected to having the information on their place of work released to the media. For that reason [the court considers that] the refusal to communicate such information to the media does not demonstrate that Ms S. had made fun of the President of the Russian Federation.”', '42.  The District Court awarded Ms S. RUB 20,000 from the applicant company and RUB 3,000 from the applicant Mr Smetanin in respect of non-pecuniary damages, RUB 2,500 and RUB 1,000 respectively for legal fees, and RUB 30 and RUB 10 respectively for court fees.', '43.  On 6 April 2005 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld the judgment in a summary fashion.', '44.  On 11 May 2005 the Leninskiy District Court gave judgment in a second defamation claim lodged by Ms S. against the applicant company, Mr Smetanin and Mr Ovchinnikov.', '45.  Analysing the article by the individual applicants which appeared in issue no. 48 of 30 November 2004 under the headline “S. is cheating ...” («С-ва обманывает»), the District Court determined that the headline itself did not contain information about concrete facts or events because it did not specify “what the nature of the cheating had been and whom and when the plaintiff had cheated”.', '46.  The District Court further examined the following extract from the same article:\\n“... in 2002, the regional control and audit department checked the accounts of the fund relating to the organisation of summer holidays and discovered an overexpenditure of 11 million roubles. We think that such a considerable amount was transferred by Ms S.’s fund to Ms U[.]’s company. According to our sources, the law-enforcement authorities took an interest in that transaction, but someone quickly cooled their interest down.”', '47.  The District Court considered that the sentence about the transfer of a large amount of money to Ms U.’s company was not actionable in defamation since it was phrased as the authors’ supposition. On the other hand, it held that the final sentence about the sudden loss of interest by the law-enforcement authorities was damaging to the plaintiff’s reputation as it contained “an assertion of Ms S.’s involvement in unlawful distribution of the assets of the social-security fund”.', '48.  In respect of the article entitled “S.’s case” («Дело С-вой») in issue no. 1 of 11 January 2005, the District Court found that it contained untruthful and damaging allegations that Ms S. had renovated her flat at the expense of the social-security fund and that she had lent the fund’s money to private companies almost for free.', '49.  The final element of the defamation claim was the article which appeared in issue no. 4 of 1 February 2005. It concerned a possible replacement of Ms S. as the director of the Ivanovo social-security fund with another person and contained the following statement:\\n“This fact cannot give rise to optimism because, instead of one dubious individual with a criminal past, the fund will be managed by another individual who, in our opinion, should have no place in the executive power.”\\nIn respect of this sentence the District Court found as follows:\\n“There is no doubt that the sentence contains an allegation of the plaintiff’s criminal past ... whereas the defendants did not produce evidence of any such past. The fact that a criminal case was opened against Ms S. cannot attest to her criminal past as it was subsequently discontinued for lack of indications of a criminal offence. There is no doubt that the allegation of criminal past is damaging to her honour, dignity and reputation.

Before the County Court, the Association asked to have the contract declared null and void on the ground that the procedure for the validation of the contract had not been carried out in conformity with its own statutes, this having as result the fact that the contract was not legally binding on it. The applicant contested this argument.', '9.  In a judgment of 7 June 2001, the County Court found the contract to be valid and, based on an expert opinion, awarded the applicant 129,648 US dollars (USD) in compensation, USD 8,330 by way of penalties and 96,413,000 Romanian lei (ROL) for court fees.\\nAccording to the applicable law, this judgment was enforceable.', '10.

The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Mirkovci.', '6.  On 7 July 2004 the Krk Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Krku) issued an enforcement order (hereinafter “the first enforcement order”) against the applicant’s movable assets for unpaid mobile telephone bills in the period between 5 July and 6 October 2003.

At the plaintiff’s request, on 7 July 2006 the Krk Municipal Court ordered the enforcement (hereinafter “the second enforcement order”) by way of attachment of the applicant’s earnings. This decision was served on the applicant on 27 November 2006.', '8.  On 4 December 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal against both enforcement orders. She argued that she could not have made the said telephone calls, because she had been in prison between 14 August 2003 and 26 October 2004 and the police seized her mobile telephone. She enclosed a receipt to show that her mobile telephone and SIM cards had been taken from her.', '9.  She further argued that the first enforcement order had never been served on her as she was in prison at the time.', '10.  Finally, the applicant requested the quashing of the certificate of enforceability (klauzula ovršnosti) of the first enforcement order.', '11.  The recipient of the applicant’s submission of 4 December 2006 was the Krk Municipal Court, which forwarded it to the Koprivnica County Court (Županijski sud u Koprivnici) as an appeal against the second enforcement order.', '12.  On 29 August 2007 the Koprivnica County Court declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible as lodged out of time, finding that the last day for lodging an appeal was 5 December 2006, whereas the appeal had been lodged on 6 December 2006.', '13.  On 17 September 2007 the applicant asked the County Court to rectify its decision, as in fact she had lodged her appeal on 4 December 2006.', '14.  On 12 October 2007 the Koprivnica County Court dismissed the applicant’s request for rectification. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:\\n“... the Court can rectify mistakes in names and numbers and other obvious mistakes... and flaws... In this case, the complaint was indeed erroneously declared inadmissible as out of time... Nevertheless, a mistake of this sort is not an obvious mistake... which can be rectified, but it is an erroneous decision binding the Court after its service on the parties, notwithstanding its invalidity...\\nIt should be mentioned, however, that the enforcement debtor did not suffer any disadvantage as a result of such a decision. The enforcement debtor in fact appealed against the enforcement order... of 7 July 2006 on the grounds of a serious breach of procedural rules, arguing that the enforcement order was not served on her. Since the enforcement order in question was merely a decision changing the means of enforcement, and a decision of such nature can be appealed against only if it orders enforcement of objects and rights exempted from enforcement (section 46 (2) of the Enforcement Act)... the enforcement debtor’s appeal should have been dismissed.\\nIf the enforcement debtor’s claim that the initial enforcement order was never served on her were true, that decision could not have become final and the enforcement debtor should, in the view of this Court, have asked the first-instance court to duly serve the enforcement order on her, so that she could appeal against it...”', '15.  The applicant subsequently made a constitutional complaint, following which the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) separated that complaint into a complaint against the decision of the Koprivnica County Court to declare the applicant’s appeal inadmissible and a complaint against the refusal of the Koprivnica County Court to rectify its previous decision. The Constitutional Court declared both complaints inadmissible on 26 October 2009, on the grounds that they did not concern decisions on the merits of the case and as such were not susceptible to constitutional review.', '16.

They are all members of Ilinden’s managing council.', '8.  The relevant background circumstances are described in detail in paragraphs 9‑21 of the Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 59491/00, 19 January 2006).', '9.  On 20 October 2002 a group of one hundred and eleven supporters of Ilinden held a meeting at which they resolved to form a non-profit association. They adopted its articles and elected its bodies, including thirteen members of its managing council.', '10.  Clause 6(1) of the articles, which defined the association’s goals, said, inter alia, that Ilinden was “a successor and continuer of the national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation”, including the “Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian state terrorism and genocide”. Clause 6(2) specified that Ilinden “recognise[d] and respect[ed] the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bulgaria and its laws and constitution, but only if they [were] consonant with international law and international agreements on human rights, fundamental freedoms and minorities’ rights”. Clauses 6(4) and 6(5) stated that Ilinden’s goals included “expressing and defending the civil, national, social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction), and of the Macedonians who live in Bulgaria” and “requesting cultural autonomy status for Pirin Macedonia in order for the assimilation process to be stopped”.', '11.  Clause 7(1) to (6) of the articles provided that to attain its goals Ilinden would propagate Macedonian culture and traditions, hold meetings to commemorate historical dates, “nominate Macedonians for Members of Parliament”, petition the government and various international institutions for the “national rights of the Macedonians”, and organise conferences and seminars.', '12.  Clause 32(1) said that the association would be run and represented by a managing council. According to clause 32(3), it would have three to seven members. However, clause 32(5) specified that the first managing council would have three members.', '13.  On 21 October 2002 Ilinden applied for registration to the Blagoevgrad Regional Court. In a judgment of 18 November 2002 the court refused to register the association. It gave the following reasons:\\n“The evidence ... shows ... that the activities of the organisation seeking registration are directed against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation. This is apparent from the association’s main goals ... and the means for attaining them...\\nTheir wording ... shows their political character. ...The organisation says that it is a successor of and continues the ‘national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation’, including the ‘Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide’[. Its articles of association] specify that [the organisation] will respect the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bulgaria, but only if ‘[it is] consistent with international law and international agreements on human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rights of minorities’; [that the organisation] will ‘express and safeguard the civil, social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction) and of the Macedonians who live in Bulgaria’[. The articles also] insist that ‘the process of assimilation in Pirin Macedonia must be stopped’. Obviously, the aim is to distort the historical truth, to ignore the Bulgarian character of certain geographical regions [and] to provoke overt opposition by one part of the population to another. This also threatens the territorial integrity of the country, whereas Article 44 § 2 of [the Constitution] prohibits organisations from engaging in such activities.\\nEven if, despite [what was found] above, it is assumed that the activities of [Ilinden] do not run counter to [the Constitution], its Article 12 § 2 provides that associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties. The political character of the aims [of Ilinden] is clearly shown by [its articles of association], while the [applicable law] provides that organisations seeking to engage in political, trade‑union or religious activities must be regulated in a separate statute.\\nAll this leads to the conclusion that what is sought is the registration of an association whose aims are illegal. It cannot be accepted that what is at issue is an organisation seeking to preserve the historical traditions and the cultural riches of a specific community. ... The realisation of the true aims [of Ilinden] would no doubt be at the expense of the unity of the Bulgarian nation [and] the sovereignty and the territorial integrity [of the country], which is declared inviolable by Article 2 § 2 of the Constitution.”', '14.  Ilinden appealed to the Sofia Court of Appeal, arguing, inter alia, that it was not threatening the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor trying to distort the “historical truth”. The refusal to register it was in breach of Article 38 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 below), as it was based on the fact that it expressed views which differed from the officially sanctioned ones. It was not proposing to engage in activities characteristic solely of a political party either.', '15.  On 11 July 2003 the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment. It held, in so far as relevant:\\n“The Blagoevgrad Regional Court ... received an application by the managing council of the newly formed non-profit association [Ilinden], requesting it to be registered ... in the special register kept by the court... In [the impugned judgment the Blagoevgrad Regional Court] refused to register the association..., holding that [Ilinden]’s goals and the means for attaining them have a political character and run counter to the spirit of [the 2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act] and the provisions of the [Constitution]. This court shares those conclusions.\\nThe evidence submitted alongside the application for registration, namely the articles of the non‑profit association [Ilinden], the minutes of its founding meeting, held on 20 October 2002, a list of the founders, thirteen sample signatures of the members of the managing council, notarised and expressly stating that these persons wish to take part in the association’s management and representation, and their criminal records, shows that a founding meeting was held on 20 October 2002. It was attended by 111 individuals, who unanimously resolved to form a non‑profit association named [Ilinden], adopted its articles and elected a managing council consisting of thirteen members. However, the wording of the articles – clauses 6 and 7, [which set out] the association’s goals and the means for attaining them – reveal their political character, which is impermissible for a non‑profit association. This follows from the interpretation of paragraph 2 of [the 2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act], which provides that organisations intending to carry out political, trade‑union or religious activities must be regulated by separate statutes. For instance, in clause 6(1), (4) [and] (5) of its articles the organisation proclaims itself as being a successor of and continuing the ‘national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation’, including ‘the Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide’, declares that ‘it will express and defend the civil, social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation (jurisdiction) and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria’, insists that ‘the assimilation process in Pirin Macedonia must stop’, etc. All those goals set by the newly formed organisation are directed towards distorting the historical truth and ignoring the Bulgarian character of certain geographical regions, with a view to stirring overt confrontation between one group of Bulgarian citizens and another, which imperils both the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation. This is in breach of the imperative rule of Article 44 § 2 of [the Constitution] which provides that ‘organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity ... are prohibited’. Moreover, the political goals and the ways of attaining them, set by the organisation in clause 7(2), (3) and (4) of its articles, are in breach of paragraph 2 of [the 2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act] and Article 12 § 2 of [the Constitution]. Apart from that, the founders have elected thirteen members of the managing council, in breach of the articles which provide, in clause 32(5), that the first managing council will consist of three members who will manage and represent the association (clause 32(1)). This was equally in breach of section 20(6) and (9) in conjunction with section 18(1)(3) of [the 2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act], because it engenders uncertainty as to the manner of managing and representing the organisation.\\nIn view of the foregoing, this court finds that the newly formed organisation [Ilinden] has goals, ways of attaining them and representation which run counter to the provisions of [the 2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act]. For this reason, it should not be entered on the register of non-profit legal persons kept by [the Blagoevgrad Regional Court]. ...”', '16.  On 3 November 2003 Ilinden appealed on points of law. It argued, inter alia, that, contrary to the Sofia Court of Appeal’s ruling, its articles, when read properly, showed that it did not intend to participate in political life. Nor was it trying to distort the historical truth – its aim was to promote it. The refusal to register it violated its right to freedom of association, enshrined in Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution, and was in breach of Article 38 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 below). Ilinden also contested the Sofia Court of Appeal’s findings concerning its managing council.', '17.  In a final judgment of 12 May 2004 (реш. № 342 от 12 май 2004 г. по гр. д. № 1992/2003 г., ВКС, търговска колегия) the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia Court of Appeal’s judgment in the following terms:\\n“The Sofia Court of Appeal founded the refusal to register the association on the wording of the articles of association, more specifically clauses 6 and 7, which show that the goals sought to be attained by the association and the means for their attainment are political in character. The [Constitution] guarantees freedom of association, but only in line with the requirements of the law. It is not permissible for a non‑profit association to carry out political, trade‑union or religious activities. The assertion in the appeal that [Ilinden] does not seek to engage in political struggles is not substantiated. As correctly observed by [the Sofia Court of Appeal], an organisation which proclaims itself as being a successor and continuing the ‘national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation’, and its founders as spiritual successors of ‘the Macedonian fighters who fell victim to Bulgarian State terrorism and genocide’ has a markedly political character. The [lower court] correctly held that an activity consisting in ‘safeguarding the social and economic rights of the Macedonians who live on Macedonian soil under Bulgarian occupation and of the Macedonians living in Bulgaria’ is in breach of Article 44 § 2 of the [Constitution], which prohibits organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, or towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity. But even if [the court] were to accept the argument in the appeal that the organisation does not seek to attain goals which run counter to the constitutional order, those goals run counter to the [2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act], as they are characteristic of a political party, not of a non‑profit association. Thus, the alleged violation of Article 38 of the [Constitution] has not been made out.\\nThe argument in the appeal that the articles of association in reality merely mention the minimum number of members of the managing council, without further restrictions, is unfounded. Clause 32(3) of the articles enclosed in the case file says that the managing council consists of three to seven members. Clause 32(5) makes special provision for the first managing council and says that it will consist of three members serving three years. That is, clause 32(5) does not merely set a minimum, as claimed in the appeal. For this reason, [the Sofia Court of Appeal] correctly found that the imperative rule of section 20(6) and (9) in conjunction with section 18(1)(3) of the [2000 Non‑Profit Legal Persons Act] has not been complied with – the manner of managing and representing the organisation is unclear.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court is of the opinion that the grounds of appeal have not been made out and that [the impugned judgment] should be upheld.”'], 'applicants': ['UNITED MACEDONIAN ORGANISATION ILINDEN', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['BULGARIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['11'], 'violated_articles': ['11'], 'court_assessment_references': {'11': ['13', '15', '17', '18']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 8, 10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 8, 10], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 4], 'explained_distances': [0.07159574, 0.044578396, 0.038263857, 0.016787946, -0.00034295022, -0.00034295022, -0.00034295022, -0.00034295022, -0.00034295022, -0.00034295022, -0.0133048445], 'number_of_sentences': 11, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The first applicant is born in 1966, the second applicant is her oldest daughter, born in 1988, the third and fourth applicants are her sons, born in 1989 and 1990, and the fifth and sixth applicants are her youngest daughters, born in 1993 and 1999. They are currently in Sweden.', '8.  On 14 February 2006 the first and fifth applicants arrived in Sweden and, two days later, they applied for asylum and residence permits. The second, third, fourth and sixth applicants arrived in Sweden on 17 August 2006 and applied for asylum and residence permits on the same day. The Migration Board (Migrationsverket) held three interviews with the first applicant and two interviews with the fifth applicant. The applicants’ legal representative was present at the third interview with the first applicant and at the second interview with the fifth applicant. The legal representative also submitted written submissions to the Board concerning all of the applicants.', '9.  During the three interviews held by the Migration Board on 16 February, 6 March and 5 October 2006, the first applicant essentially told the Board the following. She was from Sana’a in Yemen where she had lived with her husband, X, and their five children. She and X came from the same clan and he worked in industry. In her view, they had been poor. Her mother, one brother and two sisters lived in Yemen and another brother lived in London. Her father was deceased. She had travelled with the fifth applicant to Sweden, via Paris, using their passports and with French visas. She had thrown the passports away upon arrival in Sweden for fear of being sent back. They had paid about 2,000 US dollars (USD) for their tickets and about USD 1,000 for the visas. She had paid for this by selling gold that she owned. A friend of hers had helped to obtain the visas from the French Embassy in Sana’a in January 2006. Her brother had obtained their passports without X’s knowledge. The second, third, fourth and sixth applicants had travelled to Sweden illegally with the help of smugglers.', '10.  The first applicant claimed that her biggest problem was X who had abused her for many years. They had married when she was 14 years old and he had been very strict and had hit her, burnt her and threatened her with a knife. She had back problems caused by the violence and had received an injection at a hospital in Sana’a a few months before leaving the country to alleviate the back pain caused by a slipped disc. She had tried to obtain a divorce but the judge at the court had told her that she should solve her private problems with her husband. She had not contacted a lawyer as she had no money and she had not reported the violence to the police because they did not interfere in family matters.', '11.  However, the first applicant alleged that the main reason for leaving Yemen had been to protect her daughters. The second applicant had been forced to marry an older man when she was 14 years old and forced to leave school because of it. X had also planned to marry off the fifth applicant to a much older man when she was only thirteen years old. The first applicant had petitioned the courts to stop the marriage but the courts had decided that X, as the head of the family, was entitled to make that decision. She claimed that women had no freedom in Yemen and that X would kill her if she were returned since she had dishonoured him by leaving the country with their daughter and without his permission. No one would be able to protect her and her daughter.', '12.  The fifth applicant supported her mother’s claims, stating that X had wanted to marry her off to an older man against her will. The court case to stop the marriage had taken about six months and the outcome had favoured X for which reason she and the first applicant had left the country. Her uncle had helped them to obtain travel documents so they could leave the country legally. She also stated that X had worked at a ministry and that he had been very strict with her and her mother.', '13.  The second applicant also supported her mother’s claims and submitted that X had married her off, at the age of 14, to a much older man who had eight children and a disabled first wife. He had treated the second applicant like a servant but had agreed to divorce her if he was reimbursed the USD 4,000 that he had paid as a dowry for her to X. After her mother and sister had left the country, the second applicant alleged that X had made her other siblings leave the house but that they had been able to stay with a friend of hers until they could travel to Sweden. She submitted that, if they were to return to Yemen, they would all risk being killed since they had dishonoured X. She also risked being killed by her husband since she had left him without his permission.', '14.  In a later submission, the second applicant added that X would never allow her to return home even if she did obtain a divorce from her husband. Moreover, when X had made her siblings leave their home, she had exceptionally been allowed by her husband to house them.', '15.  On 9 May 2007 the Migration Board rejected the applications. It first noted that the applicants had not submitted their passports or any other documents to prove their identity or to support their story. It then observed that Yemen is a tribal society dominated by a patriarchal social order where women are subject to discriminating treatment and where they have to obey their husbands. Turning to the applicants’ personal situation, the Board first pointed out that the first applicant’s brother had failed according to the “honour rules” by helping her to obtain a passport. Moreover, it considered that the mere fact that the first applicant had left the country, and by doing so allegedly dishonoured her husband, was not sufficient to create a need for protection in Sweden. In this respect, the Board observed that the first applicant’s clan could protect her against X. Concerning the fifth applicant, the Board considered that X’s actions had been motivated by financial gain and that, by paying the necessary sum to X, the fifth applicant could solve any problems that might arise. Here, it noted that the applicants’ contention that they were poor was contradicted by the fact that they had been able to afford to travel to Sweden since the cost of the journey would have been a fortune to a poor person. Turning to the second applicant, the Board observed that her husband had consented to divorce her if she reimbursed him the sum he had originally paid X. Again, the Board considered that the problem was mainly a financial matter which could be solved by paying the required amount. In regard to the remaining applicants, the Board found that they would be able to stay with their maternal grandparents or other relatives in the clan.', '16.  Thus, the Board concluded that the family’s problems were related to financial matters rather than to honour and, consequently, they could not be considered refugees or otherwise in need of protection in Sweden. Since the situation in Yemen was not such as to call for an automatic grant of residence permits, the applicants’ requests were rejected. In reaching this conclusion, the Board had regard to the fact that some of the applicants were minors.', '17.  The applicants appealed against the decision to the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen), maintaining their claims and adding that they had disgraced the head of their family as well as the clan by fleeing. Since they were members of the same clan as X and, since the clan always took the side of the man, it would not protect them. On the contrary, the clan, which was very large and powerful, had blacklisted them and they were convinced that the clan would kill them to save its honour. Moreover, the first applicant’s brother had helped them in secret and had risked his own life by doing so. He would not be able to help them again. According to the applicants, there was no one in Yemen who would be able to protect them. Furthermore, the applicants insisted that their need for protection was honour-related and not economic in nature. The second and fifth applicants did not have the money necessary to buy their freedom and, in any event, nothing would hinder X from marrying them off to someone else later on. The first applicant added that she had been a member of a women’s association which had met on Thursdays and Fridays and that she had told the women in the association about her problems and they had lent her some money to pay for travel. The remainder of the cost, she had paid by selling her jewellery. As concerned the other applicants, the second applicant had helped to pay for that trip.', '18.  In support of their claims, the applicants submitted an e-mail, dated 26 December 2007, and sent by a programme officer for “Sisters of Arab Forum for Human Rights”. It stated that, if the applicants were sent back to Yemen, their lives would be in danger since the first and fifth applicants had disgraced their husband/father when they had run away instead of accepting his decision that the fifth applicant marry the man X had chosen for her. It further stated that honour crimes were common in Yemen and that Yemeni law encouraged it; for example, a man who killed his wife because of infidelity would only be sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.', '19.  They also submitted a copy of a police report, dated 19 January 2008, from which it appeared that X had reported to the Yemeni Ministry of the Interior that the third and fourth applicants had stolen 1,500,000 Yemeni rial (approximately EUR 5,300) from him. He stated in the report that he had hidden the money in his wardrobe about two months previously and had discovered that it had gone two days before. He had asked his wife about it but she had not known anything and thus he suspected that his two sons had stolen the money since they had been out a lot lately. The sons had now run away from home and he wanted them arrested. It appeared from the report that a regional arrest warrant had been issued for the third and fourth applicants. The applicants claimed that this was a method for X to get the authorities’ help to locate the family in order for him to have his revenge. They had received the report from the first applicant’s brother, who had heard about it and requested a copy from the Ministry of the Interior. He had received a copy since he was the boys’ uncle.', '20.  Lastly, the applicants submitted the children’s birth certificates in original which their uncle had also acquired and sent to them.', '21.  On 19 August 2008 the Migration Court rejected the applicants’ appeal. The court first observed that the general situation for women in Yemen was not a sufficient ground for them to be granted refugee status. An individual assessment had to be made in each case. It then observed that the reasons referred to by the applicants in support of their need for protection mainly concerned problems within the personal sphere caused, inter alia, by the country’s traditions. The court further noted that, other than the first applicant’s petition to a court to stop the fifth applicant’s marriage, the applicants had not turned to the Yemeni authorities to obtain protection against X or the second applicant’s husband. The court reiterated that, before international protection could be considered for problems of violence and reprisals within the family, all avenues of mediation and protection by the national authorities should have been tried. With regard to X’s police report against the third and fourth applicants, the court considered that it would be no problem for them to prove that they were innocent since they were in Sweden at the time of the alleged crime. Therefore, they did not risk being arrested or imprisoned. The court concluded that the applicants could not be considered refugees, that they were not in need of protection and that there were no exceptional circumstances to grant them leave to remain in Sweden, even though some of them were still minors. In reaching this conclusion, the court also had regard to the fact that the family was united, that several of them were adults and that they had family and friends in Yemen who supported them.', '22.  On 22 October 2008, with one of the judges being of a dissenting opinion, the majority of the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrationsöverdomstolen) refused leave to appeal. This decision was final and the deportation order thus became enforceable.', '23.  However, in January 2009, the applicants lodged an application with the Migration Board to stay the enforcement of the deportation order and to reconsider their case due to new circumstances. They maintained their previous claims and submitted a copy of a document in Arabic that they claimed was a copy of a summons, dated 22 December 2008, and which had been issued by a Yemeni court. According to the applicants, it stated that the first applicant had taken her and X’s five children and had moved to Sweden, following a dispute between her and X regarding whether or not the fifth applicant should be married to an older man. According to the document, X requested the court to order the return of the applicants to Yemen so that the children would be with their father and to imprison the first applicant because she had disobeyed her husband and to stop her from leaving Yemen again. Moreover, X requested the court to decide that the fifth applicant should marry the man that he had chosen. The applicants contended that this, together with the other information in the case, showed clear discrimination against women and that there could be no doubt that, should they be returned to Yemen, they would be subjected to persecution because they had dishonoured the head of the family.', '24.  On 20 January 2009 the Migration Board rejected the new application and decided that the measures to enforce the deportation order should continue. The Board found that the grounds invoked by the applicants had already been examined earlier in all essential parts and that no new circumstances had been presented which could lead to a stay of the enforcement of the deportation order. Furthermore, it considered that the applicants had invoked no other new circumstances which could lead to granting them residence permits in Sweden.', '25.  The applicants appealed against the decision to the Migration Court, insisting that the evidence showed that inhuman treatment awaited them if they were returned to Yemen. However, on 13 February 2009, the court upheld the Board’s decision and reasoning in full and rejected the appeal.', '26.  Upon further appeal, the Migration Court of Appeal, on 5 March 2009, refused leave to appeal', '27.  On 24 March 2009, upon request by the applicants, the Court applied Rule 39 of the Rules of Court until further notice. On the same day and on the basis of the Court’s request, the Migration Board stayed the enforcement of the deportation order until further notice.'], 'applicants': ['A.A.', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['SWEDEN'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '46', '7', '2'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['100', '101', '102', '12', '17', '23', '24', '25', '34', '36', '37', '39', '40', '41', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '70', '78', '79', '80', '82', '84', '85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91', '92', '93', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98', '99'], '7': ['21', '49', '50', '51', '52'], '46': ['14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '49', '50', '51', '52'], '41': ['29', '30', '31']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'explained_indices': [1, 3, 0, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 19, 20, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.046338677, -0.013713539, -0.04246837, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.048294604, -0.059027135], 'number_of_sentences': 21, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants were born in 1943, 1937 and 1965 respectively and live in Skopje.', '6.  In 1950 two plots of land (former plots nos. 100 and 102) were confiscated from the late Mr K.S., the applicants’ predecessor, and a third person. The land was divided into several new plots, which were renumbered in accordance with the new land register (нов премер). A new plot, no. 2943/6, comprising both the former plots nos. 100 and 102, was created. Two separate sets of restitution proceedings concerning the former plots nos. 100 and 102 respectively – both including parts of plot no. 2943/6 – were instituted by ten individuals (“the claimants”) in respect of property confiscated from their predecessor and by the applicants in respect of property confiscated from Mr K.S.', '7.  On 7 December 2001 the claimants submitted a request to the Restitution Commission of the Ministry of Finance (“the Restitution Commission”) for the restitution of several plots (those comprising former plot no.100) – including part of plot no. 2943/6, the surface area of which was 2,260 sq. m. – that had been confiscated from their late predecessor. On 24 June 2002 the Restitution Commission granted the restitution claim in the relevant part and returned the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 to the claimants. The restitution order was based on the report – dated 22 February 2002 – of an on-site examination carried out on 20 February 2002 by three representatives of the competent body within the Ministry of Finance. In the relevant part, the restitution order stated that:\\n“...an on-site inspection of plots nos. 2943/3 and 2943/6 was carried out... and established that the land in question was undeveloped building land, but that preliminary construction work had been undertaken, the legal basis of which should be determined”.', '8.  The relevant parts of the report of 22 February 2002, which was submitted in the case-file, stated inter alia:\\n“The former plot no. 100 comprised parts of new plots nos. 2943/3 and 2943/6 and 6798 on which preparatory construction work had begun: on the day the examination was carried out, the construction site was fenced off and initial digging had started ...\\nAccording to cadastral records (катастарот на недвижности), plots nos. 2943/3 and 2943/6 are recorded in land register (имотен лист) no. 30165 as an orchard ... and as undeveloped building land belonging to (a company) G.D.\\nSince preparatory construction work has begun on the site and there is no information as to its legal basis, we consider that the [Restitution Commission] should examine the circumstances in order to decide whether the land in question could be returned or not, given the fact that no buildings have been constructed on the plot.”', '9.  After the restitution order had become final, the public prosecutor and the Solicitor General (Јавен Правобранител) requested that the Government Appeal Commission (“the Appeal Commission”) declare it null and void (барање за огласување ништовно) in the part concerning plots nos. 2943/3 and 2943/6. On 20 November 2003 the Appeal Commission granted the requests, finding that plot no. 2943/6 could not be returned to the claimants since 1) a building permit for the construction of a petrol station had been issued on 16 May 2001 (it became final on 2 June 2001), namely, before the restitution claim was submitted and 2) according to an on-site examination carried out on 22 February 2002, construction work had started on the plot in question.', '10.  On 5 November 2004 the Supreme Court, relying on sections 20 and 72 of the Restitution Act (see paragraphs 26 and 32 below) quashed the Appeal Commission’s decision, stating inter alia:\\n“... since the entry into force of the Restitution Act, no changes of fact or law regarding a property are allowed. In practical terms this means that since the entry into force of the Restitution Act, a property subject to restitution cannot be disposed of, no construction work can be carried out on it ... and no decisions conferring rights on third persons can be made in respect of that property ... the only legal issue of relevance for the merits of a restitution claim is the state of the property, actual and legal, at the time when the Restitution Act entered into force. Any changes, in fact or law, to that property made after the entry into force of the Act are irrelevant ...”', '11.  Consequently, the court found it irrelevant that the building permit for the construction of a petrol station pre-dated the claimants’ restitution claim. It ruled that the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 should therefore be restored into the claimants’ possession since it was undeveloped when the Restitution Act entered into force. It remained undeveloped after the restitution claim was submitted (7 December 2001), as was clear from the on-site examination report of 22 February 2002. In such circumstances, the court held that the plot had been correctly returned to the claimants, under section 28(2) of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 28 below).', '12.  The public prosecutor challenged this decision by means of a request for a review of its legality (барање за заштита на законитоста). On 12 December 2005 the plenary session (општата седница) of the Supreme Court dismissed the public prosecutor’s request and upheld the judgment of 5 November 2004, stating inter alia:\\n“... the court correctly held that the construction work noted in the on-site examination report of 22 February 2002 does not signify that the plot in question constituted developed building land within the meaning of the Building Land Act ... Consequently, having regard to the date of entry into force of the Restitution Act and the fact that the plot in question was undeveloped, the court correctly decided that there were legal grounds for title to the plot in question to be restored under section 20 of the Restitution Act ...”', '13.  On 16 May 2006 the Appeal Commission again declared the restitution order of 24 June 2002 null and void. On 22 December 2006 the Supreme Court quashed this decision again, instructing the administrative body to comply with its judgment.', '14.  On 22 March 2007 the Appeal Commission refused the requests of the public prosecutor and the Solicitor General for the restitution order of 24 June 2002 to be declared null and void. On 27 March 2008 the Administrative Court (Управен суд), which, under newly adopted legislation, had become competent to decide such issues, dismissed an appeal on points of law submitted by the Solicitor General (тужба за управен спор). The court endorsed the reasoning given in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 5 November 2004. Referring to the preparatory construction work indicated in the on-site examination report of 22 February 2002, it also stated that any further construction work on the plot in question had been carried out contrary to section 72 of the Restitution Act.', '15.  On 6 March 2002 the applicants requested the restoration of former plot no. 102, which included part of plot no. 2943/6, confiscated from the late Mr K.S. (the surface area of this part was 1,449 sq. m).', '16.  On 27 December 2003 the Restitution Commission delivered a partial decision (делумно решение) by virtue of which the undeveloped plots were returned to the applicants and compensation was awarded for the plots which had meanwhile been developed. It also ruled that a separate decision would be given concerning the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6. As indicated in this decision, it replaced a decision of 9 September 2003 in which the Restitution Commission had, inter alia, restored the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 to the applicants (this latter decision, which was not submitted by the parties, was set aside by the Appeal Commission upon an appeal by the Solicitor General).', '17.  In its decision of 27 December 2003, the Restitution Commission further referred to a report issued by the State Geodetic Institute (Државен Завод за геодетски работи) on 5 August 2002 at the request of the Ministry of Finance. In the report the State Geodetic Institute identified, on the basis of an on-site examination carried out in the presence of a representative of the Restitution Commission, the plots of land under the new land register that comprised the former plot no. 102. Given the plots of land that are referred to in the report, it is obvious that it was issued in connection with the applicants’ restitution claim. The relevant parts of this report stated that:\\n“According to cadastral records ...\\nPlots nos. 2943/3 and 2943/6 are recorded in land register no. 30165 as follows: plot no. 2943/3 as orchards ... and plot no. 2943/6 as undeveloped building land, the total surface area of which was 3,970 sq. m., belonging to G.D.”', '18.  The Restitution Commission also referred to an examination carried out on-site on 10 December 2003 (the report of which was not submitted in evidence) according to which petrol tanks had been installed on the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 (вкопани цистерни за гориво). The Commission also quoted a letter of 22 December 2003 in which the Ministry of Transport and Communications confirmed that proceedings for obtaining documents relevant to the construction work on plot no. 2943/6 were still pending. Given the fact that the administrative proceedings for obtaining documents for the construction work were pending, the Restitution Commission ruled that the applicants’ claim regarding the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 would be decided by means of a separate decision. This decision became final on 26 February 2004.', '19.  On 3 March 2004 the Restitution Commission granted the applicants’ restitution claim concerning the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 and awarded them monetary compensation in State bonds. Relying on an “additional on-site examination” (дополнителен увид на лице место) of 10 December 2003, the Restitution Commission found that the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6 had been developed, namely that part of a petrol station had been built on it.', '20.  The applicants appealed against this decision, arguing that the Restitution Commission had erred regarding both the facts and the law, that it had based its decision on the on-site inspection report of 10 December 2003, and that it had not provided any evidence regarding the timing or legality of the construction of the petrol station. They further argued that the plot in question had been disposed of contrary to section 72 of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 32 below). They claimed restoration of title to the relevant part of plot no. 2943/6, as was the case with the claimants who had obtained title to the remainder of that plot. In this connection they referred to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 5 November 2004 (see paragraph 10 above).', '21.  On 27 February 2006 the Appeal Commission dismissed the applicants’ appeal and confirmed the Restitution Commission’s decision of 3 March 2004. It found that the Restitution Commission had correctly established that the relevant land had been developed, as was apparent from the on-site examination report of 10 December 2003. The building permit for the construction of the petrol station of 16 May 2001 (upheld by the Supreme Court on 20 March 2003) was not to be considered a legal measure or unilateral declaration within the meaning of section 72 of the Restitution Act. It was a decision taken by a competent body at the request of a private company, which, as a user of an undeveloped plot of a State-owned land (корисник на градежно неизградено земјиште во државна сопственост), had the right to construct the petrol station in compliance with local urban planning rules. Referring to section 27(2) of the Restitution Act, the Appeal Commission found that the Restitution Commission had correctly applied sections 37 and 38 of the Restitution Act (see paragraphs 29 and 30 below). It stated that:\\n“What needs to be examined is whether confiscated agricultural land (as in the present case) was undeveloped building land when the restitution claim was submitted but not when the Restitution Act entered into force. Both the impugned decision and the appeal confirm that the restitution claim was submitted on 6 March 2002 and that the building permit for the construction of the petrol station was dated 16 May 2001. [The applicants] neither suggest nor is there any evidence in the case file that the construction of the object had not started before the restitution claim was submitted. On the contrary, the on-site examination carried out by the Restitution Commission on 10 December 2003 confirms that part of a petrol station had been built on this construction land.”', '22.  The applicants challenged this decision by way of an appeal on points of law in which they argued that the plot in question had been undeveloped when they submitted the restitution claim. In this connection they referred to the on-site examination of 22 February 2002, which had been carried out only twelve days before their restitution claim. They further submitted in evidence copies of several letters that they had sent to the competent authorities and the investor requesting termination of the construction work pending the outcome of the restitution proceedings. They also submitted in evidence certain court judgments, on the basis of which the building permit of 16 May 2001 was no longer final. They further argued that in any event the fact that the building permit of 16 May 2001 pre-dated their restitution claim was irrelevant for the reasons advanced in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 5 November 2004. The applicants requested that the court follow, in their case, the Supreme and Administrative Courts’ judgments delivered in the restitution proceedings instituted by the claimants concerning the same plot (no. 2943/6), in order to ensure consistent application of the law.', '23.  On 26 June 2008 the adjudicating panel of the Administrative Court with the same composition as the panel that adopted the judgment of 27 March 2008 (see paragraph 14 above) dismissed the applicants’ appeal and ruled, for the same reasons advanced by the Appeal Commission, that the plot in question could not be restored into the applicants’ possession. This judgment was served on the applicants on 1 September 2008.', '24.  On 29 May 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants’ request for the proceedings to be reopened, finding that the judgment of 27 March 2008 had been delivered in a different set of proceedings and accordingly could not serve as a legal ground for a different decision in the applicants’ case. Furthermore, that judgment could not be regarded as new evidence.'], 'applicants': ['STOJANOVSKI', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['FORMER YUGOSLAV MACEDONIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'court_assessment_references': {'1': ['11', '12', '14', '17', '18', '19', '22', '27', '28', '36', '38', '41', '42', '43', '8'], '41': ['24', '34']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17], 'explained_indices': [2, 1, 3, 0, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 9, 18, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 10, 19], 'explained_distances': [0.23825985, 0.15216178, 0.049018025, 0.040165186, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556, 0.0026691556], 'number_of_sentences': 20, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Belgrade.', '6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '7.  On 30 July 1991, in the course of a fight between two groups of youths, the applicant’s son (hereinafter “A”), aged 21, was fatally shot by an off-duty police officer (hereinafter “B”), who had apparently attempted to assist his own brother as one of the participants in the said incident.', '8.  On an unspecified date thereafter the District Public Prosecutor’s Office (Okružno javno tužilaštvo) in Belgrade charged B with murder, as well as a number of other persons for several related crimes.', '9.  The decision to institute a formal judicial investigation (rešenje o sprovođenju istrage) was adopted on 5 August 1991.', '10.  On 30 December 1991, however, the charges against B were dropped, and on 13 January 1992 the investigating judge (istražni sudija) of the District Court (Okružni sud) in Belgrade decided to terminate the proceedings against him (obustavi istragu).', '11.  During the said investigation the defendants had all been heard in person, as had several witnesses, including A’s own brother. The investigating judge had further obtained relevant medical and ballistics reports, as well as other expert testimony. The autopsy report had also been produced.', '12.  On 4 February 1992 the applicant filed an indictment (optužnica) against B with the District Court, and thus took over the prosecution of the case in the capacity of a “subsidiary prosecutor” (see paragraph 32 below).', '13.  On 29 January 1996 the District Court acquitted B, stating that he had acted in self-defence.', '14.  Between 4 February 1992 and 29 January 1996 more than a dozen hearings had been held before the District Court. The applicant and numerous witnesses, as well as medical and ballistics experts, had all been heard, and a re-construction of the events in question had been carried out.', '15.  On 24 March 1999 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Srbije) quashed the judgment of 29 January 1996 and ordered that the case be re-examined at first instance. In so doing, it described the District Court’s reasoning as incoherent and noted that its establishment of the facts and its assessment of evidence had been fundamentally flawed.', '16.  On 4 November 2002 the District Court again acquitted B, re-affirming that he had acted in self-defence.', '17.  On 20 April 2004 the Supreme Court quashed the District Court’s judgment. It noted that the said court’s reasoning had almost exclusively taken into account the evidence in favour of B, having ignored or misrepresented the rest. The District Court was thus ordered to thoroughly review the case and re-assess the evidence. The District Court received the Supreme Court’s decision on 21 September 2004.', '18.  The next hearing before the District Court was scheduled for September 2006, but was subsequently cancelled by the court itself because it had, apparently, been unable to secure the proper composition of its bench.', '19.  On 18 December 2006 the District Court adjourned the hearing because of the inability of B’s lawyer to appear in court due to a prior professional commitment.', '20.  Following an additional adjournment on 27 June 2007, a new hearing was set for 19 September 2007.', '21.  On 19 September 2007 the District Court again adjourned the hearing, this time because it had been informed that B, still an active police officer, had been sent, as a member of the Serbian contingent, to take part in the United Nations’ mission in Liberia. The decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministarstvo unutrašnjih poslova) issued in this respect, on 3 August 2007, stated that B’s posting would last for a period of one year, but that it could be extended. The District Court scheduled the next hearing for 2 November 2007, which was apparently when B was supposed to briefly visit Belgrade.', '22.  On 4 October 2007, however, the applicant was informed that the next hearing would instead be held “on 3 October 2007”.', '23.  The applicant thereafter went physically to the District Court’s registry and was told that the upcoming hearing was still scheduled for 2 November 2007.', '24.  On 2 November 2007 the applicant therefore appeared before the District Court, but was informed by the presiding judge that the hearing had been set for 30 October 2007. The judge ultimately accepted to schedule a new hearing for 14 December 2007.', '25.  On 23 November 2007, however, the applicant received the District Court’s decision of 30 October 2007, declaring that the proceedings had been terminated due to the applicant’s failure to appear before the court on the latter date.', '26.  On 26 November 2007 the applicant complained about this decision, and on 6 December 2007 the District Court re-instituted the proceedings in question.', '27.  Between 20 February 2008 and 4 December 2008 a total of six hearings were adjourned by the District Court, the reasons for this being: (i) B’s failure to appear in court (on three occasions); (ii) the presiding judge’s wish to withdraw from the case in view of the applicant’s complaints against him (once); and (iii) the inability of B’s lawyer to appear in court as a result of a traffic accident (twice).', '28.  By October 2009 the District Court had held another three and adjourned another two hearings. Specifically, the hearings of 24 April 2009, 29 June 2009 and 9 October 2009 had been held, during which B and a number of witnesses had been re-heard, whilst the hearings of 28 January 2009 and 30 November 2009 had been adjourned due to B’s failure to appear in court and the presiding judge’s absence, respectively.', '29.  In December 2009 the presiding judge was not re-elected to the bench. The case was therefore assigned to another judge and the proceedings started anew.', '30.

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Essen.', '7.  On 15 November 1983 the applicant took up the position of organist and choirmaster at the Catholic parish church of Saint Lambertus (“the parish church”) in Essen.', '8.  Article 2 of his contract of employment dated 30 January 1984 stipulated, inter alia, that the Ecclesiastical Employment and Remuneration Regulations (see paragraph 37 below), as currently in force, formed an integral part of the contract and that any serious breach of the Church’s principles constituted a material ground for termination of contract without notice, in accordance with Article 42 of those regulations.', '9.  After the contract had been approved by the Bishop’s Vicar General, the applicant took the following oath:\\n“I hereby undertake to discharge my professional duties and to fulfil and observe ecclesiastical obligations.”', '10.  From 1 January 1985 onwards he also held the position of head musician in the deanery and was paid a gross monthly salary of 5,688.18 marks (about 2,900 euros).', '11.  In 1994 the applicant left his wife, who was the mother of his two children. The separation was made public in January 1995. Since then the applicant has been living with his new partner, who has also been his representative before the employment tribunals and the Court.', '12.  On 2 July 1997, after the applicant’s children had told people at their kindergarten that their father was going to have another child, the Dean of the parish discussed the matter with the applicant.', '13.  On 15 July 1997 the parish church dismissed the applicant with effect from 1 April 1998 on the ground that he had breached his duty of loyalty under Article 5 of the Catholic Church’s Basic Regulations (the “Basic Regulations” – see paragraph 38 below). In the light of the Catholic Church’s fundamental principles enshrining the sanctity of marriage, the applicant, by having an extramarital relationship with another woman, who was expecting his child, was accused not only of committing adultery but also of bigamy.', '14.  Following the applicant’s dismissal his wife petitioned for divorce, which was granted on 13 August 1998.', '15.  On 24 July 1997 the applicant took his case to the Essen Employment Tribunal.', '16.  On 9 December 1997 the Employment Tribunal granted the applicant’s claim and found that the dismissal of 15 July 1997 had not terminated his contract of employment. Observing the findings of the Federal Employment Court’s judgment of 9 April 1997 (see Obst v. Germany, no. 425/03, §§ 12-19, 23 September 2010), which had applied the principles set out by the Federal Constitutional Court in its leading decision of 4 June 1985 (see paragraph 35 below), it took the view that the applicant’s conduct did not yet (noch nicht) justify his dismissal, under section 1(1) of the Protection from Dismissal Act (see paragraph 36 below). In the Tribunal’s view, he had not been bound by heightened duties of loyalty (gesteigerte Loyalitätsobliegenheiten) because he did not perform pastoral or catechistic duties, did not have a canonical mandate (missio canonica) and was not a member of the managerial staff (leitender Mitarbeiter) within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Basic Regulations. In the Tribunal’s view, the respondent had not proved that the applicant’s duties as head musician of the deanery were equivalent to managerial office; accordingly, pursuant to Article 5 §§ 1 and 2 of the Basic Regulations, the parish church should first have summoned him for a clarification interview (klärendes Gespräch) or issued him with a warning (Abmahnung) before having recourse to the most serious of the disciplinary measures available, his dismissal, especially on account of his length of service in the parish church (fourteen years) and the fact that he had practically no chance of finding work as an organist on the labour-market outside the Catholic Church. The Employment Tribunal observed that an employer could only be dispensed from the obligation to issue a warning in the first instance where the employee could not expect his or her conduct to be tolerated by the employer in view of the seriousness of the breach, or where he or she was not inclined to perform, or capable of performing, his or her professional duties.', '17.  In the Tribunal’s view, in so far as the parish church reproached the applicant for having fathered a child out of wedlock, such a shortcoming, after fourteen years of service, did not attain a level of seriousness that justified dismissal on that ground alone without prior warning. Article 5 § 4 of the Basic Regulations expressly required consideration of the question whether a staff member opposed the precepts of the Catholic Church or, whilst recognising its precepts, had not succeeded in complying with them in practice. The Tribunal added that the parish church had failed to prove that the applicant had told the Dean he did not wish to put an end to his new relationship.', '18.  On 13 August 1998 the Düsseldorf Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed an appeal by the parish church. It endorsed the findings of the Employment Tribunal, observing that the reason for dismissal had not been the applicant’s paternity of a child born out of wedlock but rather his long-term extramarital relationship. The Tribunal pointed out that, whilst the applicant’s duties in the Church did not fall under Article 5 § 3 of the Basic Regulations, his dismissal nevertheless remained possible under Article 5 § 4, in view of the proximity between his work and the Church’s proclamatory mission. However, after formally hearing evidence from the applicant as a party to the proceedings, the Appeal Tribunal reached the conclusion that the dismissal had been vitiated by a procedural omission, as the parish church had failed to prove that the Dean had first sought to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship. In view of the fundamental significance of the case, the Tribunal granted leave to appeal on points of law before the Federal Employment Tribunal.', '19.  On 12 August 1999 the Federal Employment Tribunal quashed the judgment of the Appeal Tribunal. It took the view that Article 5 § 1 of the Basic Regulations, which required a clarification interview, applied not only to dismissals decided under paragraph 2 of that Article (dismissal as the ultimate measure for a serious breach) but also to those based on paragraph 3 (exclusion from post as a matter of principle, and possibility of waiving dismissal on an exceptional basis). The difference between the two paragraphs being merely a question of degree, a clarification interview would be necessary in all cases. In the case before it, the Federal Tribunal took the view that considering the lack of clarity of the ecclesiastical provisions applicable to the applicant as to whether or not his functions entailed heightened duties of loyalty, it had not been clearly established that the applicant could have known with sufficient foreseeability that his dismissal would fall under Article 5 § 3 of the Basic Regulations. If the holding of a clarification interview had been mandatory in the applicant’s case, the absence of such an interview was thus capable of rendering his dismissal wrongful (sozialwidrig). However, the Federal Employment Tribunal observed that the Employment Appeal Tribunal had been mistaken in finding that no interview had been conducted with the applicant. On that point it took the view that the Appeal Tribunal had wrongly omitted to hear evidence also from the Dean, as a party to the proceedings, in order to establish whether or not he had attempted to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship and that, accordingly, the judgment appealed against was to be quashed. However, since the facts had not yet been sufficiently established, the Federal Employment Tribunal was not in a position to rule on the question whether the applicant’s dismissal had been justified. As a result, it referred the case back to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.', '20.  The Federal Employment Tribunal further observed that, where an employing church entered into employment contracts, it used not only the freedom of contract (Privatautonomie) provided for under ordinary domestic labour law, but also the institutional guarantee of autonomous management enjoyed by the Churches. Church labour law was therefore applicable in conjunction with the ordinary domestic law. The enactment of the Basic Regulations, in particular Articles 4 and 5, reflected the principle of the Catholic Church’s autonomy, as provided for in Article 137 § 3 of the Weimar Constitution (see paragraph 34 below). The application of domestic labour law could not call into question the specificity of ecclesiastical service, which was protected by the Constitution. The Catholic Church was therefore entitled to base its contracts of employment on the model of a Christian service community and, in particular, to require its Catholic employees to recognise and comply with the principles of Catholic religious and moral precepts, as provided for in Article 4 § 1 of the Basic Regulations. As the credibility of the Church might depend on its employees’ conduct and respect for the ecclesiastical order, including in their day-to-day lives, Articles 4 and 5 of the Basic Regulations stipulated the applicable criteria on which to assess contractual duties of loyalty and the seriousness of any breach of such duties.', '21.  The Federal Employment Tribunal added that the specificity of the duties of loyalty lay in the fact that they concerned not so much occupational duties as conduct falling within secondary duties or even private life. It noted that the sanctity of marriage formed an integral part of the basic principles of the Catholic Church’s religious and moral precepts. The case concerned not only a relationship and a contract but also a sacrament. Even though adultery was no longer an offence since the new version of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, marriage had retained its indissoluble, perpetual and exclusive nature.', '22.  The Federal Employment Tribunal noted that, when employment tribunals applied ordinary labour law, they were bound by the precepts of religious denominations in so far as those precepts took account of the criteria recognised by established Churches. However, in applying those precepts the employment tribunals’ decisions could not run counter to the fundamental principles of law, which included the concepts of “morality” and “public order”. According to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 35 below), it was for the employment tribunals to ensure that religious denominations did not impose excessive requirements of loyalty on their employees. The Federal Employment Tribunal found that the beliefs of the Catholic Church regarding fidelity in marriage were not at odds with the fundamental principles of law. Marriage enjoyed special protection under Article 6 of the Basic Law and adultery was regarded as a serious fault in a civil law context. The Tribunal observed that it had, moreover, already found in its judgment of 24 April 1997 that adultery constituted a serious fault in the view of the Catholic Church (see Obst, cited above, § 15).', '23.  The Federal Employment Tribunal concluded that the Employment Appeal Tribunal had rightly considered that the applicant’s conduct could be characterised as a serious personal moral fault, within the meaning of Article 5 § 2 of the Basic Regulations, and that it therefore constituted a ground for dismissal for the purposes of section 1(2) of the Protection from Dismissal Act. It noted that the applicant’s opinion that only a new marriage – which, according to the Catholic Church’s belief would be null and void – could be regarded as a serious breach was not substantiated by any provision of the Basic Regulations or other instruments.', '24.  On 3 February 2000, after the case had been referred back to it, the Düsseldorf Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the parish church’s appeal against the judgment of the Employment Tribunal of 9 December 1997. After hearing evidence from the Dean as a party to the proceedings, and with the applicant having acknowledged that he had, at his interview of 2 July 1997 with the Dean, described as permanent his new relationship with his lawyer, the Tribunal held that the parish church had dismissed him in accordance with Article 5 § 1 of the Basic Regulations. According to the Dean’s statements at the hearing – which the Tribunal found more credible than those of the applicant – there had indeed been an interview between the two parties. In view of the applicant’s inflexible position as regards his new relationship, the Dean and the parish church had rightly considered that a prior warning would be superfluous.', '25.  The Employment Appeal Tribunal added that it was not unaware of the consequences of the applicant’s dismissal, which would most likely prevent him from exercising his profession and from paying the same amount in child maintenance. However, it admitted that the parish church could not continue to employ the applicant without losing all credibility in relation to the mandatory nature of its religious and moral precepts. In this connection it was necessary to take into account the fact that, even if the applicant was not among those members of staff that were bound by heightened duties of loyalty under Article 5 § 3 of the Basic Regulations, his activity was closely related to the Church’s proclamatory mission. It was thus hardly conceivable vis-à-vis the general public that the applicant and the Dean could continue to perform the liturgy together. According to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the interests of the parish church prevailed by far over those of the applicant.', '26.  On 29 May 2000 the Federal Employment Tribunal found inadmissible a request by the applicant to appeal on points of law.', '27.  On 8 July 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court disallowed a constitutional complaint by the applicant (no. 2 BvR 1160/00) on the ground that it had insufficient chances of succeeding. In the Federal Court’s opinion, the decisions appealed against did not raise any constitutional issues in the light of its 4 June 1985 judgment (see paragraph 35 below).', '28.  Since September 2002 the applicant has been employed as choirmaster for a Protestant church in Essen and he also directs three choirs on a voluntary basis.', '29.  On 22 December 1997 the parish church issued a second dismissal with effect from 1 July 1998. On 4 December 1998 the Employment Tribunal rejected an application for annulment lodged by the applicant. To date those proceedings are still pending before the Düsseldorf Employment Appeal Tribunal.', '30.  The status of Churches and religious societies is governed mainly by Articles 137 to 141 (known as the “Church Articles” – Kirchenartikel) of the Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919, as incorporated into the Basic Law by Article 140 of that Law. A large number of Churches and religious societies, including the Catholic Church (about 24.9 million members) and the Protestant Church of Germany (about 24.5 million members), commonly known as the two “big Churches” (Grosskirchen), have the status of public-law entity but are not, however, part of government. Other religious denominations have legal capacity under civil law. The status of public-law entity enables the Churches concerned, among other things, to receive Church tax and to employ public servants.', '31.  The Catholic Church and the Protestant Church employ over one million individuals, particularly in their charities, making them the second largest employer in Germany after the State. The two main charities alone, Caritas (Catholic) and Diakonie (Protestant), employ respectively almost 500,000 and 450,000 “staff members”. Their activities concern mainly the running of hospitals, schools, kindergartens, homes for children and the elderly and advice centres (for HIV sufferers, migrants, victims of domestic violence). The Catholic and Protestant Churches regard their social activities as being part of their proclamatory mission and a way of putting the “love thy neighbour” commandment into practice.', '32.  The law governing employment relationships between Churches and their public servants is based on civil-service law. As regards other employees, the ordinary domestic labour law will apply, but with a certain number of exceptions stemming from the Churches’ right of autonomy. As a result of that right they may, among other things, impose specific duties of loyalty on their employees (see below). Moreover, in terms of industrial-relations law, Churches and their institutions are not bound by the domestic right of employee participation. Considering that their activities, especially charity work, are based on the model of a Christian service community, formed by the whole body of staff, they do not accept legal structures based in principle on an opposition between employer and employee. The Catholic Church and most of the Protestant denominations thus refuse to enter into collective agreements with trade unions, and the right to strike or lock-out are non-existent in their institutions. However, they have created their own systems of representation and staff participation in management.', '33.  As regards their financing, Churches and religious societies having the status of public-law entity are entitled to receive Church tax, which constitutes a significant portion (about 80%) of their total budget. Church tax is levied by the State tax authorities on behalf of Churches and religious societies, which in return pay the State 3 to 5% of their tax revenue. This is based on income tax, amounting to between 8 and 9% thereof. It is paid directly to the Treasury by the taxpayer’s employer together with income tax. In this connection municipal authorities issue “wage-tax cards” (Lohnsteuerkarte) that employees are required to give their employers. The card contains information about the employee, including the tax regime, rebates for dependent children and membership of a Church or religious society entitled to receive Church tax.', '34.  Article 140 of the Basic Law provides that Articles 136-139 and 141 of the Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919 form an integral part of the Basic Law. Article 137 reads as follows:\\nArticle 137\\n“(1)  There shall be no State church.\\n(2)  The freedom to form religious societies shall be guaranteed. ...\\n(3)  Religious societies shall regulate and administer their affairs independently within the limits of the law that applies to all. They shall confer their offices without the involvement of central government or local authorities.\\n(4)  Religious societies shall acquire legal capacity in accordance with the general provisions of civil law.\\n(5)  Religious societies shall remain entities under public law in so far as they have enjoyed that status in the past. Other religious societies shall be granted the same rights upon application, if their constitution and size of membership provide guarantees of long-term existence ...\\n(6)  Religious societies that are entities under public law shall be entitled to levy taxes on the basis of the civil taxation rolls in accordance with the law of the Land.\\n(7)  Associations whose purpose is to foster a philosophical belief in the community shall have the same status as religious societies.\\n(8)  Such further regulation as may be required for the implementation of the present provisions shall be a matter for the legislature of the Land.”', '35.  On 4 June 1985 the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a leading judgment on the validity of dismissals of Church employees on the grounds of a breach of their duty of loyalty (nos. 2 BvR 1703/83, 1718/83 and 856/84, judgment published in the Reports of Judgments and Decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court, volume 70, pp. 138-73). The subject matter of the constitutional complaints was, on the one hand, the dismissal of a doctor practising in a Catholic hospital on account of a view he had expressed on abortion, and on the other, the dismissal of a commercial employee of a youth home run by a Catholic monastic order because he had left the Catholic Church. The two dismissed employees had been successful in proceedings before the employment tribunals and the employing Churches had then taken their cases to the Federal Constitutional Court, which allowed their complaints.\\nThe Federal Constitutional Court observed that the right of religious societies to manage their affairs autonomously within the limit of the general law, as enshrined in Article 137 § 3 of the Weimar Constitution, applied not only to the Churches, but also, regardless of legal form, to any institution associated with them and participating in their mission. This constitutional guarantee included the right for the Churches to choose the staff they needed for the fulfilment of their mission and, accordingly, to enter into employment contracts. When the Churches chose to exercise their freedom of contract, like everyone else, then ordinary domestic labour law became applicable. However, the applicability of labour law did not have the effect of removing employment relations from the domain of a Church’s own affairs. The constitutional guarantee of autonomy (Selbstbestimmungsrecht) afforded to Churches affected the content of contracts of employment. A Church could thus, in the interest of its own credibility, base its contracts of employment on the model of a Christian service community, and, accordingly, require its employees to respect the general principles of its dogmatic and moral doctrines and the basic duties applicable to all its members. That did not mean, however, that the legal status of a Church’s employee became “clericalised”. It merely concerned the nature and scope of duties of loyalty stemming from employment contracts. The civil-law employment relationship was not thereby transformed into an ecclesiastical status that subsumed the employee and dominated his entire private life.\\nThe Federal Constitutional Court further observed that the freedom of the Churches to manage their own affairs was circumscribed by the general law, including those provisions that granted protection against wrongful dismissal such as section 1 of the Protection from Dismissal Act and Article 626 of the Civil Code. However, those provisions did not automatically prevail over the so-called “Church Articles” of the Weimar Constitution. It was thus appropriate to balance the different rights, with particular weight being accorded to the Churches’ interpretation of their own faith and legal order. The Federal Constitutional Court continued as follows:\\n“It follows that, whilst the constitutional guarantee of the Churches’ right to manage their affairs autonomously permits them to base their contracts of employment on the model of a Christian service community and to lay down the basic ecclesiastical duties, such guarantee must be considered in terms of constitutional law and its scope must be stipulated when it comes to applying the provisions concerning protection against dismissal to dismissals for a breach of duties of loyalty. An application of labour law that did not take account of the duties of Church employees to respect the fundamental principles of Christian life that the Churches are entitled to impose would be at odds with their constitutional right of autonomy.\\nConsequently, in the event of a dispute, the employment tribunals must apply the criteria laid down by the Churches concerning the assessment of the contractual duties of loyalty since the Constitution affords to Churches the right to decide on such matters autonomously. It is thus in principle for the established Churches (verfasste Kirchen) to determine what is required by ‘the credibility of the Church and its proclamation’, what ‘specific ecclesiastical tasks’ are, what ‘proximity’ to the Church means, what ‘the basic principles of religious and moral precepts are’ and what constitutes a breach – a serious breach in some cases – of its precepts. Matters governed by the Churches’ right of autonomy also include the question whether and how a scale of duties of loyalty must be applied to staff members working in the service of a Church.\\nIn so far as such principles correspond to the criteria laid down by the established Churches, a question that must be referred by the tribunal to the Church authorities in case of doubt, the employment tribunals will be bound by them, unless by applying them they put themselves in conflict with the fundamental principles of law, such as the general prohibition of arbitrariness, the principle of morality, and public order. It is therefore a matter for the domestic courts to ensure that ecclesiastical institutions do not impose on their staff unacceptable demands of loyalty that might, in some cases, be at odds with the very principles of the Church ...\\nIf the tribunal reaches the conclusion that there has been a breach of such duties of loyalty, it must ascertain whether that breach objectively justifies dismissal under section 1 of the Protection from Dismissal Act and Article 626 of the Civil Code ...”', '36.  Section 1(1) and (2) of the Protection from Dismissal Act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz) provides, in particular, that a dismissal is socially unjustified unless based on reasons related to the employee himself or his conduct.\\nArticle 626 of the Civil Code allows each party to the contract to terminate the employment relationship without notice on serious grounds.', '37.  Article 2 § 2 (b) of the Ecclesiastical Employment and Pay Regulations (Kirchliche Arbeits- und Vergütungsverordnung) for the Dioceses (or Archdioceses) of Aachen, Essen, Cologne (Köln), Münster (part of North Rhine-Westphalia) and Paderborn, dated 15 December 1971, as in force until 1 January 1994, required that the way of life of the employee and the members of his household be compliant with the basic principles of the religious and moral precepts of the Catholic Church.\\nArticle 6 provided that respect, manifested in words and deeds, for the principles of the Catholic Church, and a conduct in line with that required by ecclesiastical staff members, formed part of the employee’s duties.\\nArticle 42 § 1, in the version currently in force, provides in particular that a serious ground justifying dismissal without notice is constituted by a patent breach (großer äusserer Verstoß) of ecclesiastical principles, for example the fact of leaving the Church (Kirchenaustritt).', '38.  Articles 4 and 5 of the Basic Regulations of the Catholic Church for ecclesiastical service in the context of ecclesiastical employment relationships (Grundordnung der Katholischen Kirche für den kirchlichen Dienst im Rahmen kirchlicher Arbeitsverhältnisse), which were adopted by the Episcopal Conference of German Bishops on 22 September 1993 and which came into force in the Diocese of Essen on 1 January 1994, read in their relevant parts as follows.\\n \\nArticle 4Duties of loyalty\\n“1.  Catholic employees [Mitarbeiterin und Mitarbeiter] are required to respect and comply with the basic principles of the Catholic Church’s religious and moral precepts. The example of personal life led in conformity with those principles is seen as important in particular for employees who perform pastoral, catechistic or educational duties, or who have a canonical mandate [Missio canonica]. These duties also apply to senior management staff.\\n... 4.  Employees shall refrain from any hostile attitude towards the Church. They shall not undermine, by their personal way of life or professional conduct, the credibility of the [Catholic] Church and of the institution for which they work.”\\nArticle 5\\nBreaches of duties of loyalty\\n“1.  Where an employee no longer satisfies the employment criteria, the employer shall seek by discussion to prevent the breach in question with permanent effect. The employer will have to ascertain whether, to put an end to the said breach of duty, a clarification interview [klärendes Gespräch], a warning [Abmahnung], a formal reprimand, or any other measure (relocation, contractual amendment) would be appropriate. Dismissal may be envisaged in the last instance. 2.  The Church shall regard as serious and as justifying dismissal on specifically ecclesiastical grounds [Kündigung aus kirchenspezifischen Gründen] the following breaches of the duty of loyalty:\\n– a breach of the duties provided for in Articles 3 and 4 hereof, in particular the fact of leaving the Church and public defence of positions that run counter to the Catholic Church’s guiding principles (for example those concerning abortion), and serious personal moral misconduct [schwerwiegende persönliche sittliche Verfehlungen];\\n– the fact of entering into a marriage that is null and void in the light of the Church’s faith and legal order, as interpreted thereby ... 3.  The existence of one of the forms of conduct referred to under paragraph 2 of the present Article, and which are regarded as a general rule as grounds for dismissal, shall preclude the possibility of maintaining an employee in his or her post if the employee performs pastoral or catechistic duties, is a member of the managerial staff, or has a canonical mandate [Missio canonica]. The employer may, on an exceptional basis, waive dismissal where the circumstances of the case indicate that such a measure is inappropriate. 4.  Where the employee belongs to one of the categories referred to in paragraph 3 [of the present Article], the possibility of maintaining the employee in his or her post will further depend on the circumstances of the case, in particular the extent of the risk that the credibility of the Church or its institution might be called into question, the burden placed on the ecclesiastical service community, the nature of the institution and its task, the institution’s proximity to the Church’s proclamatory mission, the employee’s position within the institution and the nature and seriousness of the relevant breach of the duties of loyalty. It will also be necessary to consider whether the employee has opposed the precepts of the Church or whether, whilst recognising those precepts, has not succeeded in complying with them in practice.”', '39.  Under section 2(3) of the Ecclesiastical Law on Religious Music[1] of 15 June 1996, a church musician employed by the Protestant Church must in principle be affiliated with a denomination which is a member of the Protestant Church of Germany or part of an ecclesiastical union therewith. Under section 21(2) of that Law, in conjunction with section 7(1) of the implementing law of 13 November 1997[2], a person not fulfilling this condition may nevertheless be appointed, on an exceptional basis, to a post of church musician in secondary employment (Nebenamt) if he or she is affiliated with a Christian denomination that is part of the Labour Association of Christian Churches in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft christlicher Kirchen in Deutschland), to which the Roman Catholic Church belongs. Under the Regulations of 18 November 1988 on the employment of church musicians[3], the average working week of such musicians in secondary employment represents less than eighteen hours.', '40.  Directive 2000/78/EC of the Council of the European Union of 27 November 2000 (“the Directive”), establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, reads as follows:\\nRecital 24\\n“The European Union in its Declaration No. 11 on the status of Churches and non-confessional organisations, annexed to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty, has explicitly recognised that it respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of Churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States and that it equally respects the status of philosophical and non-confessional organisations. With this in view, Member States may maintain or lay down specific provisions on genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirements which might be required for carrying out an occupational activity.”\\nArticle 4\\nOccupational requirements\\n“1.  ... Member States may provide that a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to [religion or belief] shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate. 2.  Member States may maintain national legislation in force ... or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of this Directive pursuant to which, in the case of occupational activities within Churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person’s religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out, a person’s religion or belief constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation’s ethos. ...\\nProvided that its provisions are otherwise complied with, this Directive shall thus not prejudice the right of Churches and other public or private organisations, the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, acting in conformity with national constitutions and laws, to require individuals working for them to act in good faith and with loyalty to the organisation’s ethos.”', '41.  The German legislature transposed the Directive into national law by means of the General Equal Treatment Act (Gesetz zur Umsetzung europäischer Richtlinien zur Verwirklichung des Grundsatzes der Gleichbehandlung – Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) of 14 August 2006. Section 9 thereof reads as follows:\\n“(1)  Without prejudice to the provisions of section 8 [hereof], a difference in treatment based on religion or belief shall also be admitted in the case of employment by religious societies, by institutions affiliated therewith, regardless of legal form, or by associations whose purpose is to foster a religion or belief in the community, where a justified occupational requirement is constituted by a given religion or belief, having regard to the employer’s own perception, in view of the employer’s right of autonomy or by reason of the nature of its activities.\\n(2)  The prohibition of differences in treatment based on religion or belief shall not affect the right of the religious societies, institutions affiliated therewith, regardless of legal form, or associations whose purpose is to foster a religion or belief in the community, as referred to in the previous subsection, to require their employees to demonstrate loyal and sincere conduct within the meaning of their own perception.”', '42.  On 31 January 2008 the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Federal Republic of Germany (procedure no. 2007/2362) concerning the transposition of Directive 2000/78/EC into German law and concerning, among other things, “dismissals not covered by anti-discrimination law”. It noted that, whilst the Directive permitted a difference in treatment only if the religion or belief constituted a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation’s ethos, section 9(1) of the General Equal Treatment Act also provided for different treatment when the religion or belief constituted an occupational requirement on the basis of its right of autonomy and the religious society’s or association’s own perception, without necessarily having regard to the nature of the activity. According to the European Commission, such a difference not being covered by the terms of the Directive, this manner of transposition did not fulfil the Directive’s objectives. Such transposition would enable a religious society to define an occupational requirement purely on account of its right of autonomy, without the requirement undergoing a proportionality test in the light of the actual activity. In addition, whilst Article 4 § 2 of the Directive presented the question in terms of genuine and determining occupational requirements, section 9(1) of the General Equal Treatment Act had reduced that notion to one of justified occupational requirements, which was a weaker standard than that of the Directive. The European Commission further observed that, whilst an organisation’s particular ethos played a role in determining the occupational requirement, it should not be the sole criterion, otherwise German legislation might not guarantee such a difference in treatment and, even as regards ordinary assistance activities, specific requirements related to religious affiliation might be imposed.\\nOn 29 October 2009 the European Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Germany. It was stated in a press release published on the same day (IP/09/1620) that in its opinion the Commission had pointed out, among other things, that protection against discriminatory dismissals was not covered by German anti-discrimination law. The government’s reply to the letter of formal notice, the Commission’s reasoned opinion and the government’s reply to that opinion have not been made public to date.[4]'], 'applicants': ['SCHÜTH'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['30', '31', '32', '33', '35', '37', '39', '40', '41', '42', '58']}, 'silver_rationales': [24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'explained_indices': [8, 3, 4, 7, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 31, 32, 33, 24, 30, 23, 36, 21, 20, 19, 35, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 22, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.21766442, 0.19941962, 0.17281628, 0.12985873, 0.12724954, 0.07614261, 0.07008541, 0.061590254, 0.047183156, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.04535967, 0.036037087], 'number_of_sentences': 37, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant, who was born in 1956, was living in Aktaş village at the time of the alleged events giving rise to this application. The facts of the case are in dispute between the parties and may be summarised as follows.', '10.  Until October 1994 the applicant lived in Aktaş, a village of Ovacık district in Tunceli province, in the then state-of-emergency region of Turkey. In 1994, terrorist activity was a major concern in this area. Since the 1980s a violent conflict had been going on in the region between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). The inhabitants of the applicant’s village were suspected of “aiding and abetting terrorists”; and accordingly they were strictly and frequently controlled by the gendarmes stationed near the village.', '11.  On 5 October 1994 the security forces surrounded the applicant’s village and assembled the residents in the village square. Using curse words, they told them that the village would be evacuated at once with no possibility of return. The applicant took what he was able to carry with him and left the village. Immediately after the evacuation, the soldiers set the houses and the crops on fire.', '12.  The applicant moved temporarily into a prefabricated State disaster housing complex close to Ovacık.', '13.  Following the impugned events the applicant filed a petition with the Ovacık Public Prosecutor’s office complaining about the burning down and forced evacuation of his village by gendarmes.', '14.  As the case concerned an investigation into alleged acts of the security forces, the Ovacık Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non‑jurisdiction and referred the petition to the office of the District Governor in Ovacık in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakematı Kanunu).', '15.  The District Governor sent a letter to the Ovacık Gendarmerie Headquarters and requested information about the applicant’s allegations.', '16.  In a letter of 1 November 1994 the Gendarmerie Commander informed the District Governor that the security forces had not burned any house during their operations in the area. Accordingly, the Ovacık Administrative Council issued a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the gendarmes.', '17.  On 25 October 1995 the Ovacık District Governor sent a letter to the applicant. Relying on the Ovacık Gendarmerie Commander’s letter of 1 November 1994, he explained that he was unconvinced by his allegations. He further explained that pursuant to the established case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court (Danıştay), no inquiry was possible unless the identity of the accused civil servant were specified. He therefore stated that the authorities would not initiate an investigation into the alleged events.', '18.  The applicant did not receive this letter. He learned of the Ovacık Public Prosecutor’s decision of non-jurisdiction and the Ovacık Administrative Council’s decision from his fellow villagers.', '19.  In 1994 members of the PKK started a propaganda campaign for the organisation in the villages of Ovacık district. They kidnapped young men from these villages and forced them to join the organisation. The PKK militants issued threats against the villagers and harassed them. The inhabitants of the villages left their homes as a result of the pressure exerted by the PKK.', '20.  The investigation carried out by the authorities revealed that the applicant’s village had not been burned by the security forces but by terrorists wearing military uniforms. In his statements to the investigating authorities, the applicant failed to specify the identity of the perpetrators of the alleged crime.', '21.  The parties submitted various documents with a view to substantiating their claims. These documents, in so far as they are relevant, can be summarised as follows.', '22.  The applicant submitted a protocol dated 2 May 2001 in which he claimed that he had suffered financial damages because of the burning down of his village. He submitted that prior to the events in 1994 he had owned 50 acres land, 150 poplar trees, 20 walnut trees, 30 fruit trees, 400 metres square plot of land, two-story house, 40 goats, 4 cows and 50 beehives. This document has been stamped by the mayor of Aktaş village, Cafer Öztürk.\\n(b)  Annual Reports of the Human Rights Foundation (“the TIHV”)', '23.  The Human Rights Foundation is a non-governmental organisation with its head office in Ankara, Turkey. Its 1993 Report stated that, from 1990 to 1993, more than 913 villages and hamlets had been evacuated. The 1993 Report maintained that village evacuations had accelerated in 1993, mostly targeting the villages whose inhabitants refused to serve as village guards.', '24.  The 1994 Report of the TIHV argued that the Government’s policy was to claim that the evacuations and eventual destructions were caused by PKK terror, poverty and the forces of nature. According to the same report, some 50 to 60 villages were burned down in each of the provinces subject to the emergency rule.', '25.  The 1995 Report maintained that more than 400 villages had been evacuated in 1995. According to the 1996 Report, the State-of-Emergency Regional Governor once mentioned that a total of 918 villages and 1,767 hamlets had been evacuated for various reasons, although never admitting that evacuations had been carried out by security forces.', '26.  The 1997 and 1998 Reports described the Government’s policy of evacuating villages as a systematic “internal security operation” applied throughout the 1990s.\\n(c)  Excerpts from “Burned-down / Evacuated Villages and Migration”, a book published by the Human Rights Association', '27.  The excerpts gave a comprehensive list of burned-down and/or evacuated villages from February 1990 to January 1999. The list did not make any reference to Aktaş as having been evacuated and destroyed.', '28.  The excerpts contained several articles reproduced from a daily newspaper Ülkede Gündem, relating to the evacuation of villages and its detrimental effects on the displaced persons. The articles stressed that numerous villagers had filed petitions with the State authorities, complaining that their villages had been burned down by security forces.', '29.  The articles also emphasized that the Government’s public declarations, which appeared to allow displaced villagers to return to their villages, were unreliable. Whenever villagers had attempted to do so, they were physically denied access to their villages.\\n(d)  The report of 14 January 1998 of the Turkish Grand National Assembly’s Commission of Inquiry on the measures to be taken in order to address the problems of the persons displaced following the evacuation of settlement units in east and south-east Anatolia', '30.  This report was prepared by a Commission of Inquiry composed of ten members of parliament. According to the report, in 1993 and 1994 the inhabitants of 905 villages and 2,923 hamlets were evicted and forced to move to other regions of the country (p.13).', '31.  The report included a statement by Mr Doğan Hatipoğlu, a former governor of Diyarbakır. Mr Hatipoğlu explained that, during his office, occasional village evacuations by military authorities were brought to his attention. He stated that – although very rarely – he had received complaints about village burnings. According to Mr Hatipoğlu, it was inconceivable to assert that all the villages were vacated due to PKK coercion. He alleged that the Government had failed to take the necessary measures for a healthy resettlement of displaced persons (p.13).', '32.  The report also referred to the “Human Rights Report – Turkey”, prepared and submitted to the Commission of Inquiry in 1995 by Mr Yavuz Önen, the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation. This latter report dedicated a chapter to immigrants and evacuated villages. It argued that, in 1995, the practice of evacuation of villages and hamlets was widespread. Many houses in villages were either destroyed or made uninhabitable. People were forced to emigrate from the region and pressure was exerted on the inhabitants until they left their villages. In early 1995 there was practically no village or hamlet inhabited except those whose inhabitants agreed to become village guards (p.19).', '33.  The report of the Commission of Inquiry also referred to the speech delivered at the Turkish Grand National Assembly by Mr Salih Yıldırım, a deputy from Şırnak, on 3 June 1997 on the question of evacuated villages. Mr Yıldırım stated, inter alia, that the villages were evacuated either by the PKK, in order to intimidate those who opposed it, by the authorities since they were unable to protect the villages, or because the inhabitants of those villages refused to become village guards or were suspected of having aided the PKK (p. 20).', '34.  In conclusion, it was recommended in the report that the inhabitants of the settlement units should be re-housed in the provinces, districts or central villages – rather than hamlets – close to the area where they used to live and that necessary economic measures should be taken with a view to providing employment to the inhabitants of the region, priority being given to the immigrants.', '35.  This report aims at indicating the property owned by the applicant. Following an investigation carried out by the authorities it appeared that the applicant did not own any land according to the records of the land registry office and the municipal registry office. The applicant does not have any registered trees either. In his declaration of 12 May 1986 to the municipality the applicant claimed that he owned a house measuring 80 metres square, whereas in his declaration dated 2 May 1998 he noted that he owned a house measuring 140 square metres which had been built in 1980. According to the official records, he did not have any commercial activity given that he did not pay any tax before 1994. Between 1994 and 2002 he lived in one of the natural disaster houses provided to him by the Government. In 2002 he moved into a new house which was built by the Government within the framework of the “Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project”. The local authorities gave the applicant 10 sheep and 323,000,000 Turkish liras’ aid. He also benefited from the food support by the authorities.\\n(b)  Veys Toprak’s statements dated 10 March 2004, taken by two gendarmes', '36.  The witness is the mayor of Kandolar neighbourhood in Ovacık. His statements were taken in order to determine the situation of the applicant who had lodged an application with the Court. The witness stated that the applicant had lived in one of the prefabricated houses between 1994 and 2002 and that he had moved to a newly built house provided for him in 2002 by the Government. The applicant died in 2003. At the relevant time nobody lived in Aktaş.

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Omsk.', '7.  She stood as a candidate for the elections to the legislative assembly of the Omsk Region scheduled for 24 March 2002. One of her competitors was Mr K., a local businessman.', '8.  On 20 March 2002 thirty-nine minority shareholders and former employees of the local department store “Oktyabrskiy” asked the applicant to finance a campaign against Mr K., the majority shareholder of Oktyabrskiy and the chairman of its Board of Directors.', '9.  On the same day the applicant arranged for the printing of 1,500 copies of the following leaflet, drafted by the shareholders:\\n“The Truth about K[.]\\nWe, shareholders of the Oktyabrskiy department store, have suffered from K[.] We are thirty-nine employees taken hostage by that voracious big wheel. K[.]:\\n– depreciated our stock;\\n– coerced us into selling the stock for a song, threatening us with dismissal;\\n– forced thirty-nine employees to resign by not letting them work;\\n– paid a miserable salary and often paid us with rotten groceries;\\n– having ousted the shareholders by unlawful means, he has become the department store owner.\\nFor more than a year we have been fighting for our rights in courts and other instances. The law-enforcement agencies are still powerless. In Omsk and its region many people have suffered because of K[.]’s unlawful conduct; but everyone is silent and money does not smell.\\nWe, as victims of K[.]’s conduct, propose to write a book entitled ‘The story of K[.]’s dark fortune’. Let it include the story of everyone who has met that terrible man on his or her way and become his victim. His fortune was made from our tears. Do not taint yourself by supporting this man. Whatever he undertakes is damned: every spring the renovated city hall is flooded with sewage, and the Patriarch did not come to bless the Church on the left bank which had been built in breach of Orthodox canons.\\nWe have suffered much harassment, repression and many a misfortune because of this man. Do not trust his promises, they build on our sorrows and lack of rights.\\nVoters! Sign your fair judgment of K[.]! Say ‘no!’ to the fortune made from the woes and tears of simple people.\\nWe are firmly convinced that a man who breaks the Law should not be a parliamentarian and lawmaker.\\nOn behalf of the shareholders: G. F[.], L. K[.], V. A[.]” (emphasis added)”', '10.  On 26 March 2002 the applicant was elected a member of the legislative assembly of the Omsk Region.', '11.  Mr K. challenged the election results before the Omsk Regional Court. In particular, he claimed that by publishing the leaflet the applicant had resorted to unlawful electoral campaigning. The parties to the proceedings were Mr K. and the electoral commission. The applicant was cited as a third party.', '12.  On 4 June 2002 the Omsk Regional Court rejected Mr K.’s application. It found that the leaflet had called on electors to vote against Mr K., which was a permissible form of electoral agitation. The publication of that leaflet had not breached the electoral laws. If Mr K. believed that the leaflet contained untrue information damaging to his honour and reputation, it was open to him to bring defamation proceedings.', '13.  Mr K. sued the applicant and the three signatories of the leaflet for defamation. He submitted that the italicised extracts above were untrue and that the leaflet had damaged his reputation and gravely affected the voters’ freedom of choice. He claimed compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.', '14.  The applicant produced her evidence, including the original leaflet bearing thirty-nine signatures, the decision to issue additional shares taken by the Board of Directors of the Oktyabrskiy department store under the chairmanship of Mr K., and an official document showing that the flooding of the ground floor of the city hall had been due to a construction defect which had subsequently been corrected. Several of the minority shareholders had given oral testimony to the court, confirming the information contained in the leaflet.', '15.  On 11 April 2003 the Kirovskiy District Court of Omsk allowed Mr K.’s claims, finding that the defendants had failed to prove the truthfulness of the contested extracts.', '16.  Firstly, the court referred to the judgment of the Omsk Regional Court of 4 June 2002. It found that it was bound by the finding contained in that judgment that the applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of the statements in the leaflet.', '17.  The court further found as follows.\\n(a)  The decision approving the issue of 300,000 additional shares had been adopted by a general meeting of shareholders rather than by Mr K. personally. That decision had previously been found lawful by a court. Although Mr K. was a majority shareholder, the fact that he had a decisive vote in certain issues “did not imply the unlawfulness of the decisions taken. For that reason the accusation blaming Mr K. for the depreciation of the shares and the ousting of shareholders, as if it were unlawful conduct, was unsubstantiated. The defendants had failed to prove that Mr K. had acted unlawfully”.\\n(b)  It had not been shown that the depreciation had been the result of Mr K.’s conduct rather than of another cause. Moreover, the defendants had sold their shares for 800 to 1,000 roubles each.\\n(c)  That there had been compulsion to sell shares had not been established. Mr K., being the chairman of the Board of Directors, had suggested that shareholders should sell their shares at the price of 30 roubles each. There was no evidence that he had resorted to extortion, violence or threats of violence.\\n(d)  The allegation that Mr K. had “forced thirty-nine employees to resign by not letting them work” was also unsubstantiated. Mr K. had not personally signed any dismissals. The employees had resigned of their own free will and the resignations had been countersigned by the director general, Mr B. There had therefore been no causal link between Mr K.’s actions and the dismissals of the employees.\\n(e)  The defendants had failed to prove that Mr K. had been personally responsible for the payment of “a miserable salary”. The salary of the employees of the Oktyabrskiy department store had been comparable to the average salary in the region. Moreover, “the notion of a miserable salary [was] subjective and the fact that such a salary [had been] paid did not imply that it was a consequence of Mr K.’s conduct. The unlawfulness of his conduct had not been proved”.\\n(f)  The defendants had not submitted any evidence proving that shareholders had been ousted by unlawful methods or that Mr K. had obtained the ownership of the Oktyabrskiy department store unlawfully.\\n(g)  The allegation that “whatever [Mr K.] undertakes is damned” was a “violation”. The statement that the city hall was flooded every spring was untrue as additional construction works in the city hall had fixed the flooding problem. As to the statement about the church, the Prior of the church had confirmed that it had been built in compliance with Orthodox canons. Moreover, Mr K. had received a “letter of benediction” for its construction.', '18.  The District Court concluded as follows:\\n“The leaflet was clearly intended for [electoral] campaigning and essentially purported to induce, and has induced, voters to take part in the election and vote against the candidate Mr K[.], which is not prohibited under election law.\\nIt has been established that [the applicant] was not the source of the information in the leaflet, or its author; she merely disseminated it. As to the words, expressions and statements about [Mr K.’s] property and fortune and the way it was made, they reflect the opinion and civic position of a micro-community of shareholders and former employees in respect of an existing dispute between them and the joint stock company of which Mr K[.] is one of the directors. A judicial dispute concerning these matters is pending before the Omsk Commercial Court ...\\nAs the court considers it proven that the dissemination of statements by the defendants has damaged Mr K[.]’s honour, dignity and professional reputation, it awards him 500 roubles against [the applicant] in compensation for non-pecuniary damage... The court takes into account the nature of the statements disseminated and the fact that the leaflet was signed not only by the defendants, but also by thirty-nine other persons, which substantially reduced the defendants’ liability for the non‑pecuniary damage incurred by the plaintiff.”', '19.  In the operative part of the judgment the court cited the italicised statements in the leaflet and pronounced them untrue and defamatory.', '20.  The applicant appealed against the judgment. She submitted that the District Court had incorrectly considered itself bound by the judgment of 4 June 2002, which had concerned a dispute involving a different cause of action and different parties. It had concerned a dispute over the election results between Mr K. and the electoral commission; the applicant had been a third party to that dispute. The issues relating to defamation or compensation for non-pecuniary damage had not been examined in the judgment of 4 June 2002. The applicant further maintained that the defendants had submitted evidence proving the truthfulness of the contested allegations. In particular, the witnesses had confirmed that all the statements contained in the leaflet were true. The District Court’s findings had been contradictory. In particular, although the District Court had found that Mr K., being the majority shareholder of the Okrtyabrskiy department store, had influenced its policy, it had also found, conflictingly, that Mr K. had not been personally responsible for the impugned omissions. In conclusion, the applicant submitted that the judgment of 11 April 2003 had violated her right to impart opinions.', '21.  On 11 June 2003 the Omsk Regional Court upheld the judgment of 11 April 2003 on appeal. It held as follows:\\n“The conclusions of the [District] Court are correct, as it can be seen from the contents of the entire contested text that the authors presented Mr K[.], a candidate for election to the legislative assembly of the Omsk Region and head of [the Oktyabrskiy department store] as disreputable, as someone who infringes the Law and moral principles, who builds his fortune unlawfully and who harasses the shareholders of the Oktyabrskiy department store in various ways ...\\nThe [District] Court allowed the claims as the defendants had not submitted evidence showing that the allegations contained in the leaflet were true. Moreover, the assessment of Mr K[.]’s personality was formulated in clearly insulting terms. ...\\n... the [District] Court correctly considered the finding made in the judgment of the Omsk Regional Court of 4 June 2002 that [the defendants] had failed to prove the truthfulness of the statements contained in the leaflet ... as evidence established by the courts ...\\n[The applicant’s] arguments that the present case has a different cause of action and that the parties have different procedural status cannot warrant the re-establishment of a fact that has earlier been established by a court. As the Regional Court made an assessment of the truthfulness of the allegations contained in the leaflet, the courts are bound by that judgment ... in the determination of the present case.\\n[The applicant’s] argument that ... the judgment violates citizens’ constitutional right to freedom of thought, speech and information is unfounded. The views of a citizen or a group of citizens on a certain issue, if they are distributed in written form, must be formulated in proper language.\\nThe expressions used in the leaflet, such as ‘voracious big wheel’, ‘that terrible man’, ‘his fortune was made from our tears’, ‘whatever he undertakes is damned’, ‘the story of K[.]’s dark fortune’ are clearly insulting, are formulated in cynical terms, give an assessment of the plaintiff’s personality and contradict the socially acceptable norms of conduct and religious principles ...\\nThe appeal must be dismissed because the [District Court] correctly assessed the evidence, rightly concluded that the statements in the leaflet were untrue and gave judgment in accordance with the substantive and procedural rules.\\nHowever, the operative part of the judgment must be clarified. Since essentially the entire leaflet contains untrue statements damaging to Mr K[.]’s honour, dignity and professional reputation, the list of statements that were found to have been untrue must be deleted from the operative part.\\nHaving regard to the particular circumstances of the case (electoral campaigning), the fact that the widely disseminated leaflet included untrue statements damaging to Mr K[.]’s honour, dignity and professional reputation set out in a deliberately insulting form, the degree of anguish experienced by the victim, the [Regional Court] considers it appropriate to increase, in accordance with Article 151 of the Civil Code, the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage to 5,000 roubles against [the applicant] and to 2,000 roubles against [the other defendants].”'], 'applicants': ['ANDRUSHKO'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['10'], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['12', '16', '21', '23', '24', '25', '27', '29'], '6': ['53']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 10, 15], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 10, 15], 'explained_indices': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 2, 0, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.35834044, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0120969415, 0.0076324344, 0.0053438544, -0.0042633414], 'number_of_sentences': 16, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 24 September 2004 an expert witness submitted to the Herceg Novi court a recalculation of the amount owed in euros, the amount due being 6,352.42 euros (EUR).', '19.  On 8 November 2004 the Court of First Instance in Herceg Novi requested the second applicant’s lawyer to provide the necessary bank details so that a corresponding enforcement order could be issued.', '20.  Between 13 December 2004 and 28 December 2004 the said court attempted to contact the second applicant and also sought assistance from the relevant Internal Affairs Secretariat as well as a Social Care Centre in Serbia.', '21.  On 27 January 2005 the first applicant provided the court with the requested bank details.', '22.  On 4 March 2005 the Herceg-Novi court issued another enforcement order, providing that one third of the debtor’s monthly income was to be transferred to the first applicant as the second applicant’s legal guardian.', '23.  On 17 March 2005 the debtor lodged an objection, stating, inter alia, that he was supporting a family of four, two of whom were minor children, as well as paying 50% of his salary for the maintenance of another child. He proposed to pay one-sixth of his income for the enforcement in question.', '24.  On 16 May 2007 the Court of First Instance rejected the debtor’s objection and upheld its enforcement order of 4 March 2005, without considering the debtor’s arguments in respect of his financial commitments.', '25.  On 20 October 2010 the same court forwarded the enforcement order of 4 March 2004 to the Power Supply Company (Elektroprivreda – Filijala Herceg Novi), the debtor’s employer, a State-owned company.', '26.  On an unspecified date thereafter the second applicant would appear to have informed the Court of First Instance that the said enforcement order had not been complied with, apparently because the debtor was paying off several loans.', '27.  On 19 November 2010 the Court of First Instance approached the debtor’s employer, reminding them that the child maintenance, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Family Act and the Enforcement Act, had priority over all the other pecuniary obligations of the debtor and that the employer was therefore obliged to comply with the enforcement order.', '28.  On 14 December 2010 the Court of First Instance ordered the debtor’s employer to transfer to the second applicant the amount that was otherwise retained by the employer on a monthly basis on account of a loan owed by the debtor to the employer (see paragraph 37 below).', '29.  This decision would appear not to have been enforced to date.', '30.  On an unspecified date the second applicant instituted another set of civil proceedings against M.J. seeking child maintenance. She was represented by the first applicant as her legal guardian.', '31.  On 30 June 2004, after two remittals, the Municipal Court in Kruševac gave a judgment ordering M.J. to pay 8% of his monthly income from 18 February 1998, plus YUD 48,600 for the costs of proceedings. This judgment became enforceable on 23 May 2005.', '32.  The applicants maintain that they sought enforcement of this judgment, but have submitted no evidence in that regard, even though they have been requested by the Court to do so on at least three occasions.', '33.  This judgment would appear not to have been enforced to date.', '34.  On an unspecified date the second applicant instituted another set of civil proceedings against the debtor, seeking an increase of the child maintenance established by the decision of 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 31 above). On 17 September 2009 the Municipal Court in Kruševac gave a decision stating that the second applicant’s claim had been withdrawn. On 2 October 2009 the second applicant appealed against this decision. These proceedings appear to be still pending.', '35.  On 3 February 1997 the debtor and his spouse at the time lodged with the Court of First Instance in Herceg Novi a plea for dissolution of their marriage, proposing to the court, inter alia, that the debtor’s spouse be given custody of their two minor children, born in 1990 and 1995 respectively, and that the debtor pay in respect of child maintenance 50% of his monthly income. There is no decision of a domestic court in this regard in the case file.', '36.  On 17 July 2009, in criminal proceedings, the debtor was found guilty of not paying child maintenance to the second applicant between 23 May 2005 and 30 January 2006, and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, suspended for a period of one year. It would appear that the decision is still pending on appeal.', '37.  The debtor’s payslip of October 2010 specified that he earned EUR 559.89 per month, 62% of which he was paying towards two loans. The payslip indicates that the debtor had taken one of those loans from his employer in a total amount of EUR 5,500 ten months earlier, to be repaid over ten years, and that the other loan had been taken from a bank that very month in a total amount of EUR 54,295.75, to be repaid over fifteen years. It also transpires that over an unspecified ten-year period before October 2010 the debtor had been paying off a third loan, the monthly payment of which amounted to approximately 20% of his monthly income.'], 'applicants': ['BOUCKE'], 'defendants': ['MONTENEGRO'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['11', '12', '15', '16', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '27', '31', '36', '37', '38', '40', '41', '43', '47', '53', '65']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 31, 32], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 31, 32], 'explained_indices': [7, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 1, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 27, 28, 21, 30, 26, 20, 32, 18, 17, 31, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 19, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.17828304, 0.15973777, 0.13615447, 0.10999763, 0.10999614, 0.07737708, 0.029355764, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.009974539, 0.0084655285], 'number_of_sentences': 33, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Rostov-on-Don.', '6.  On 12 February 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant, at the material time Deputy Head of the Transport Safety Department, and he was arrested on suspicion of bribe-taking. The arrest took place in the absence of the lawyer. A search was carried out at the flat where he was staying. The applicant was released on the same day.', '7.  The applicant challenged the lawfulness of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him and of his arrest. However, on 3 August 2004 and 8 February 2005 respectively the Rostov Regional Court in the final instance dismissed his claims.', '8.  The applicant further challenged the lawfulness of the search carried out at his flat. On 14 February 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don held that the search had been carried out in compliance with the domestic law. The applicant alleged that he had not been informed of the above decision until 18 May 2004. Thus, he had been prevented from lodging an ordinary appeal against it. Later, the applicant tried to initiate a supervisory review of the decision of 14 February 2004. However, on 31 May 2004 the Rostov Regional Court found that there were no grounds for quashing the decision of 14 February 2004.', '9.  On 10 March 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don remanded the applicant in custody. The decision read as follows:\\n“... From the material submitted by the prosecution, it follows that [the applicant] was charged with several particularly serious offences, and there are grounds to suspect him of having committed other similar crimes ... Besides, as it follows from the submitted material, during the search carried out at the applicant’s flat on 12 February 2004, [the applicant’s wife] went to the balcony and threw out [documents], suggesting that she was therefore trying to hide material evidence from the investigation ... This gives grounds to believe that, if not detained, [the applicant] may interfere with the proper administration of justice by destroying or hiding evidence, preventing the investigative authorities from uncovering other instances of his illegal activities, as well as putting pressure on those witnesses who had not yet been identified or questioned.\\n[The applicant] did not provide any medical documents certifying that his state of health prevented him from being held in detention ...”', '10.  The applicant’s detention interrupted the inpatient treatment he had meanwhile been undergoing for an aggravated chronic kidney condition (acute pyelonephritis).', '11.  On 22 March 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the detention order of 10 March 2004, finding that it had been lawful and justified.', '12.  On 7 May 2004 the Leninskiy District Court, citing the gravity of the charges against the applicant, extended his detention until 12 June 2004. On 19 May 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the above decision.', '13.  On 9 June 2004 the Leninskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 12 August 2004. The court held as follows:\\n“... [The applicant] is charged with several particularly grave crimes committed by an organised group; until now, the investigating authorities have not identified all those involved in the criminal activities in respect of which [the applicant] has been charged; [the applicant] knows the persons in question. In view of the above, the court considers that, if not detained, the applicant might threaten witnesses and destroy the evidence, thereby obstructing justice ...”', '14.  The applicant appealed, claiming that the above decision was groundless. In particular, the applicant did not know any of the witnesses, all the relevant documents were seized by the investigating authorities, the applicant was suspended from work, his access to documents was restricted and the key to his office was confiscated. Furthermore, the applicant stated that he had no criminal record, that he had a permanent place of residence and a family, that, prior to his detention, he had been undergoing medical treatment for pyelonephritis but that the treatment had been interrupted and thus the condition had been aggravated and that others involved in the case had been given more lenient preventive measures.', '15.  On 30 June 2004, on appeal, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the lawfulness of the decision of 9 June 2004 without considering the arguments put forward by the applicant.', '16.  On 10 August, 8 September and 9 November 2004 the Leninskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 12 September, 12 November and 12 December 2004 respectively. The court again referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the risk that he might put pressure on witnesses or otherwise obstruct justice.', '17.  On 25 August, 20 September and 19 November 2004 respectively, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the above decisions on appeal.', '18.  On 10 December 2004 the pre-trial investigation was completed and the criminal case against the applicant and four other co-defendants was referred for trial to the Rostov Regional Court. The applicant remained in detention.', '19.  On 21 December 2004 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled a preliminary hearing for 29 December 2004. The issue of the applicant’s detention was left unexamined.', '20.  On 29 December 2004 the Rostov Regional Court adjourned the preliminary hearing until 12 January 2005. The issue of the applicant’s detention was again left unexamined.', '21.  On 12 January 2005 the Rostov Regional Court held the preliminary hearing, and on 13 January 2005 the court ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant should remain unchanged.', '22.  On 1 March 2005 the applicant made an application for release, which on 2 March 2005 was dismissed by the Rostov Regional Court with reference to the absence of sufficient grounds for altering the preventive measure.', '23.  On 7 June 2005 the Rostov Regional Court maintained the applicant’s custodial measure and extended it until 11 September 2005. The court reasoned its decision by the fact that the criminal case against the applicant was being examined at the final stage of the judicial investigation, that the applicant was charged with several particularly serious offences and that, if released, he might abscond or otherwise obstruct the administration of justice.', '24.  On 11 August 2005, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the lawfulness of the above extension order.', '25.  Prior to the applicant’s trial, some details of the applicant’s criminal case were disclosed by the local media.', '26.  On 8 September 2005 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant of abuse of office, bribe-taking and forgery and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.', '27.  On 22 December 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia modified the qualification of the crimes committed by the applicant and reduced the sentence to four years’ imprisonment.', '28.  From 15 March 2004 to 21 April 2006 the applicant had been held in remand prison IZ-61/1 of Rostov-on-Don (Следственный Изолятор ИЗ-61/1 Главного управления Федеральной службы исполнения наказаний по Ростовской области).

Each cell had windows measuring at least 1.2 by 0.9 meters. The windows had been barred from both the inside and the outside. The access of fresh air and day light had not been restricted. The level of natural lighting had corresponded to the established sanitary norms and allowed the inmates to read and write.', '32.  The cells had been illuminated with 100 watt filament lamps, which had been on from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekends and holidays. At night-time the cells had been lit by 75 watt security lights with tinted glass shades. Security lights had not disturbed the inmates’ sleep.', '33.  All cells had been equipped with extractor fans and a heating system, both functioning properly at the relevant time. The average winter temperature in the cells did not go below +18 degrees Celsius, and the average summer temperature did not go above +23 degrees Celsius.', '34.  The applicant had received food of adequate quality in accordance with the established legal norms.', '35.

The appalling sanitary condition of the cells had been aggravated by the arrangement of the lavatory, elevated by 0.7 meters above the floor level and separated on one side by a 1-meter-high brick or steel partition. As a result a person using the toilet was in plain view of his cellmates.', '39.  The 1-hour outside walks had not been available on the days when the applicant had been taken to participate in investigative actions or court hearings.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in the Stavropol Region.', \"7.  By a judgment of 5 December 2000 following a guilty verdict delivered by a jury, the Stavropol Regional Court convicted the applicant and his co‑defendant of murder, robbery and the illegal acquisition, storage and carrying of arms.

The applicant, who was being held in custody, appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court of Russia.

The first applicant, Mrs Brigid McCaughey, is the mother of Mr Martin McCaughey. She was born in 1934. The second and third applicants are the father and daughter of Mr Desmond Grew. They were born in 1923 and 1990, respectively. All the applicants live in County Tyrone. The case concerns the shooting of Martin McCaughey and Desmond Grew by security forces in 1990 in Northern Ireland.', '8.  On 9 October 1990 Martin McCaughey and Desmond Grew were shot and killed outside a shed on a farm near Loughgall by soldiers from a specialist unit of the British Army. The autopsy of Martin McCaughey described the cause of death as “laceration of the brain due to bullet wounds to the head”, noting that he had been struck by approximately ten high-velocity bullets in all. The autopsy of Desmond Grew described the cause of death as “multiple injuries due to multiple high-velocity bullet wounds of trunk and limbs”, noting that there were approximately forty-eight wounds made by bullets entering and exiting his body. No shots were fired by the deceased. These shootings were two of several which took place around that time and which gave rise to allegations of a shoot-to-kill policy by the security forces, including by that specialist unit, in Northern Ireland.', '9.  The shed had been under surveillance as a suspected arms dump of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The applicants maintained that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had intelligence to the effect that the deceased would collect arms at the shed. The RUC Tasking and Coordination group (“the TCG”) assigned the specialist military unit to the mission given that unit’s specific training and firepower.', '10.  On 11 October 1990 the IRA stated publicly that the deceased were IRA volunteers on active service at the time of their deaths.', '11.  The first applicant claimed that her family learned about Mr McCaughey’s death from the media and that a RUC officer rang the deceased’s family home, identified himself and taunted the deceased’s brother. The RUC formally advised the Grew family of Desmond Grew’s death.', '12.  The RUC conducted an investigation into the deaths, beginning with interviews with the soldiers involved in the operation.', '13.  The statements of Soldiers A-H, later disclosed to the applicants by the Police Service Northern Ireland (the PSNI replaced the RUC in 2001), stated as follows. Soldier H, the Captain with responsibility for the military unit, received information and briefed Soldiers A, B, C, D, E and F to observe the shed for any terrorist activity and to arrest any persons found to be so engaged. Soldier A was the team leader of the unit with command of the soldiers on the ground. Soldier H was in radio contact with the soldiers on the ground and, on receiving a report of the shooting, he dispatched Soldiers G and I to the scene. The scene was handed over at approximately 12.30 to the RUC and Soldiers A-I returned to base. Later that day (10 October 1990), members of the RUC questioned the soldiers, who were accompanied by Soldier L, from Army Legal Services. Soldier A was the first to fire a shot and he fired twenty rounds. Soldier B fired seventeen rounds, Soldier C fired nineteen rounds and Soldier D fired sixteen rounds, the last two of which were directed at Mr Grew while he was on the ground as the soldier believed Mr Grew had attempted to grab his gun. Soldiers E and F had been close by and did not discharge their weapons. Soldiers A-F believed that they had been under fire, although no shots had been fired at them. Soldier J (involved in pre-deployment training for such specialist military units) and Soldier K (the officer commanding of the unit) were involved in the planning and control of the operation.', '14.  In February 1991 the DPP received the investigation file. Between April 1991 and September 1992 the DPP issued eight directions for, inter alia, further investigative steps. On 2 April 1993 the DPP issued a direction of no prosecution (nolle prosequi) in respect of the soldiers involved in the shooting. The decision was not notified directly to the families.', '15.  In 1994 and 1995 the RUC provided certain papers to the coroner which did not include the statements of Soldiers A-I. On 23 December 1997 the coroner advised the applicants that he had received a file from the DPP. This was the first formal contact by the authorities with the applicants.', '16.  On 23 April 2002 the coroner wrote to the PSNI requesting statements from the soldiers involved in the shooting. The PSNI provided the statements but refused to provide the report of the RUC Investigating Office, the DPP’s decision or relevant un-redacted intelligence reports.', '17.  On 11 June 2002 the applicants wrote to the coroner asking when the inquest would be listed and requesting pre-inquest disclosure. On the same date, they wrote to the PSNI seeking disclosure of all documentation relating to the deaths pursuant to Article 2 of the Convention and section 8 of the Coroner’s Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 (“the 1959 Act”).', '18.  On 3 December 2002 the coroner disclosed to the applicants the depositions relating to the inquest. Since statements and documents supplied by the PSNI remained the property of the PSNI, such material could not be disclosed by the coroner to the applicants.\\n(a)  First judicial review proceedings', '19.  Following lengthy correspondence between the applicants, the coroner and the PSNI about pre-inquest disclosure, in October 2002 the first applicant’s husband (now deceased) and the second applicant issued judicial review proceedings against the coroner and the PSNI, challenging the latter’s retention of relevant documentation.', '20.  On 14 February 2003 leave to apply for judicial review was granted.', '21.  On 21 February 2003 the PSNI provided the applicants with the documents supplied by it to the coroner (see paragraph 16 above). This included the soldiers’ statements and two lists of material items of evidence, which lists indicated that certain items could not be located/had deteriorated – there was a reference to a stench on opening the main bag of materials.', '22.  On 20 January 2004 the High Court (McCaughey and Another, Re Application for Judicial Review [2004] NIQB 2) found that the PSNI was under a duty by virtue of section 8 of the 1959 Act and Article 2 of the Convention to provide the coroner with some of the withheld documents and that the inquest had been unduly delayed in breach of Article 2 of the Convention. On 14 January 2005 the Court of Appeal (Police Service of Northern Ireland v. McCaughey and Grew [2005] NICA 1, [2005] NI 344) allowed the appeal of the PSNI. Section 8 of the 1959 Act obliged the PSNI to provide the coroner with the information retained when it notified the coroner of the death but the PSNI had no such duty under Article 2 since the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the HRA”) did not apply to a death occurring before its entry into force in 2000 (In re McKerr [2004] UKHL 12, the appellant was the applicant in McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, ECHR 2001‑III).', '23.  The first applicant’s husband appealed. On 28 March 2007 the House of Lords delivered its judgment (Jordan v. Lord Chancellor and Another and McCaughey v. Chief Constable of the Police Service Northern Ireland [2007] UKHL 14): this judgment addressed the similar appeal of Hugh Jordan (the applicant in Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, 4 May 2001). It found that the HRA did not apply to a pre-HRA death nor, therefore, to the investigation of any such death. However, section 8 of the 1959 Act plainly required the PSNI to disclose to the coroner such information about the deaths as the PSNI was then or thereafter able to obtain, subject to any relevant privilege or immunity.\\n(b)  Subsequent pre-inquest procedures', '24.  In the meantime, the coronial system had been restructured so that a new coroner was to be appointed.', '25.  In December 2007 the applicants wrote to the senior coroner asking that the inquest be progressed. On 12 February 2008 the coroner’s service responded that the inquest had not yet been allocated to a coroner given workload commitments. However, the senior coroner had written to the PSNI requesting disclosure under section 8 of the 1959 Act.', '26.  In July 2008 the applicants again wrote to the senior coroner enquiring about the inquest and pre-inquest disclosure. No response was received. Their further letter of 17 December 2008 to the senior coroner was acknowledged by the coroner’s service. There was no response to their letter of 16 January 2009 to the coroner’s service: they were informally told in February 2009 that a coroner had been appointed.', '27.  On 25 June 2009 the applicants sent a letter before action to the coroner’s service about the failure to hold the inquest. On 30 June 2009 the coroner’s service responded stating that the coroner was still awaiting full disclosure from the PSNI which was expected shortly and that the coroner intended to convene a preliminary hearing in September 2009 at which he hoped to be able to set a provisional date for the inquest.', '28.  In 2009 the Historical Enquiries Team (“the HET”) advised the coroner that they anticipated commencing an investigation into the shootings of the deceased in January 2010. By a letter of 26 August 2009, the coroner advised the applicants accordingly and asked whether they would wish the inquest to proceed in advance of the HET investigation.', '29.  On 4 September 2009 a preliminary inquest hearing was held. The coroner advised that he had received full disclosure from the PSNI. Counsel for the PSNI and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) vouched that this disclosure amounted to full compliance with section 8 of the 1959 Act and that the MOD had no further documentation relating to the incident. Counsel for the PSNI was unable to advise the coroner what steps, if any, had been taken to locate certain missing exhibits. The coroner adjourned the hearing to consider the material and a further preliminary hearing was scheduled for 12 October 2009. The coroner asked for written submissions as to whether the inquest should be adjourned pending the HET investigation: the applicants opposed this orally. Finally, while the coroner noted the potential impact of the judgment of this Court in Šilih v. Slovenia ([GC], no. 71463/01, 9 April 2009) on coronial law and on the inquest, he was bound by current domestic case-law (including In re McKerr, cited above). Despite this, he considered that it was feasible to conduct a vigorous, thorough and transparent inquest.', '30.  On 15 September 2009 the applicants requested the HET to expedite its review and the HET responded that it would conduct an initial assessment and report at the coroner’s hearing of 12 October 2009.', '31.  At that hearing on 12 October 2009, the applicants argued that it would be premature to adjourn the inquest pending the HET investigation. They proposed proceeding on certain preliminary inquest issues (disclosure, remit/scope of the inquest and anonymity/public interest immunity matters): the HET issue could be reviewed when the inquest was listed for hearing. The parties and the coroner agreed. The HET agreed to bring forward the start of their investigation.', '32.  On 1 December 2009 a further preliminary hearing was held. The coroner directed that the applicants be provided with redacted volumes of the documents which had been provided by the PSNI to the coroner. He scheduled hearings on certain questions (anonymity and screening for some witnesses) for January 2010.', '33.  By letter dated 8 December 2009 the coroner proposed a “preliminary definition” of the scope of the inquest as covering the four basic factual questions – the identity of the deceased, the place of death, the time of death and how the deceased came by their deaths. In relation to how, the coroner stated that he would examine evidence concerning the circumstances in which the deceased came to be at the locus of death, the surveillance operation that culminated in the deaths, with reference, in particular, to the purpose and planning of the operation, the actions and state of knowledge of those involved in the operation, as well as the nature and degree of force used. He invited submissions thereon.', '34.  In December 2009 files of documents were provided to the applicants. A brief preliminary hearing took place on 22 January 2010. On 2 February 2010 the coroner heard oral submissions on the scope of the inquest and reserved his decision. While the applicants were satisfied with the coroner’s preliminary definition of scope noted above, the PSNI argued for a conventional pre-HRA inquest so that the verdict on “how” the deceased met their deaths should be limited to the question of “by what means” rather than including “what broad circumstances”.', '35.  A further preliminary hearing was fixed for September 2010, but did not take place. By letter dated 4 November 2010 the applicants invited the coroner to hold a further preliminary hearing on the questions of disclosure, scope, expert witnesses and site inspection.\\n(c)  Second judicial review proceedings', '36.  Following the delivery of the above-cited Šilih judgment, the first and third applicants began judicial review proceedings arguing that their inquest had, consequently, to be Article 2 compliant.', '37.  On 23 September 2009 the High Court handed down its decision (McCaughey and Quinn’s Application [2009] NIQB 77). Leave to apply for judicial review was granted as regards the delay in holding the inquest but it adjourned that question pending any decision at the coroner’s hearing due on 12 October 2009. Leave was, however, refused as regards the applicants’ submission that the House of Lords’ judgment in McKerr was no longer good law following the above-cited Šilih judgment of this Court.', '38.  By a judgment of 26 March 2010, the Court of Appeal (Re McCaughey and Quinn’s Application [2010] NICA 13) granted the applicants leave to apply for judicial review on the two Article 2 grounds not permitted by the High Court but refused those applications on their merits. However, it had a duty under section 3 of the HRA to give effect so far as possible to any relevant legislation compatibly with Convention rights, it was arguable that the Supreme Court could choose to extend Šilih (cited above) to domestic law and therefore leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted.', '39.  In November 2010 the applicants requested the continuation of the preliminary inquest hearings on certain matters including disclosure, remit, site inspection and expert reports. While not excluding the possibility, the coroner responded that those matters were preferably examined after the Supreme Court judgment.', '40.  By a judgment of 18 May 2011, the Supreme Court held by a majority (Lord Rodger of Earlsferry dissenting) that the coroner holding the inquest had to comply with the procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention (In the matter of an application by Brigid McCaughey and another for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland) [2011] UKSC 20). In Šilih (cited above), this Court departed from its earlier case-law finding that, in certain circumstances, Article 2 imposed a “detachable” investigative obligation even when the death had occurred before ratification. Those circumstances included instances where a significant proportion of the procedural steps had taken place after the Convention had come into force. Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that, as a matter of international obligation, the present inquest had to comply with Article 2 as far as this was possible under domestic law. Parliament was presumed to have intended that there would be a domestic-law requirement to mirror the international requirement and the HRA which came into effect on 2 October 2000 was to be interpreted by reference to this presumed intention. Any future inquest into a pre-HRA death had to comply with Article 2.', '41.  In a concurring judgment, Lord Brown relied on statistical information submitted by the coroner’s service in April 2011 about deaths occurring prior to October 2000: there were sixteen outstanding “legacy inquests” involving twenty-six deaths, an additional six incidents involving eight pre‑2000 deaths (which had been referred by the Attorney General to the coroner); and six inquests had not been held into six deaths which took place between 1994 and 2000 (an inquest into a death in 1995 had just closed in February 2011). Most cases concerned the use of lethal force by the security forces and some concerned killings attributed to paramilitary forces.\\n(d)  Subsequent pre-inquest procedures', '42.   In response to judgments of this Court (including the above-cited McKerr and Hugh Jordan cases), decisions not to prosecute became amenable to challenge by way of judicial review. The applicants requested reasons for the decision not to prosecute in April 1993. On 25 July 2011 the Acting Deputy DPP provided the following reasons for the 1993 decision not to prosecute:\\n“Having carefully considered all the evidence and information it was concluded that the Test for Prosecution was not met in respect of any soldier for any offence relating to the deaths of Desmond Grew and Martin McCaughey. All soldiers had raised the defence of self-defence in opening fire. As you will be aware, where the defence of self-defence is raised the burden of negativing the defence rests on the prosecution and it is for the prosecution to prove to the very high standard required in a criminal trial that the person was not acting in self-defence. It was concluded that the available evidence was not sufficient to do so.”', '43.  He could not confirm whether the next-of-kin had been informed of the DPP’s earlier decision not to prosecute but, at the time, the practice was that the police would inform relevant persons of a DPP decision. He confirmed that his office had directed that a further report be submitted by the coroner on any relevant matters which might arise at the inquest.', '44.  At a preliminary hearing on 17 October 2011, the coroner determined that the inquest would take place in March 2012. He issued directions for the service of the parties’ evidence including ordering the MOD to serve its evidence by 23 December 2011. The coroner selected the jury asking each to notify him if they had any reason to believe they would not be able to consider the evidence impartially.', '45.  On 11 January 2012 the applicants issued civil proceedings for damages as regards the shootings. That action was timed to begin within three years of the disclosure to the applicants of ballistic and forensic evidence which they considered as supportive of their allegation that the use of lethal force had not been absolutely necessary and that the operation had not been planned so as to minimise recourse to lethal force.', '46.  On 6 March 2012 the first applicant began judicial review proceedings about the failure by the HET to disclose relevant documents to the coroner disputing, inter alia, the HET’s independence from the military. The HET then issued a preliminary review of the investigation. It found that the deceased were about to embark on a planned provisional IRA operation, it approved the scene examination and the later interviewing of the soldiers and it found the latter to be consistent with the former. Soldier A had been interviewed but he essentially endorsed his earlier statement. On 19 July 2012 the HET indicated that the final report was pending.', '47.  The inquest opened on 12 March 2012 when the applicants were informed that the HET had deferred its investigation pending the inquest. The inquest lasted twenty-seven days, ending on 2 May 2012. The hearing was public and the applicants were legally represented by counsel and a solicitor.', '48.  Oral evidence was heard from twenty-three witnesses including certain RUC and military witnesses involved in matters of training, planning, command, control and supervision relevant to the mission and from RUC officers concerning the post-mission investigation. Three of the four soldiers (A, C and D) who had opened fire gave evidence. Soldier B refused to travel from the Middle East: his statement prepared in 1990 for the police investigation was read to the jury. Expert evidence was heard as to the post-incident investigation. Witnesses were cross-examined thoroughly by the applicants.\\n(a)  Inquest: the soldiers’ involvement in other lethal-force incidents', '49.  In October 2011 the applicants had requested the coroner to obtain information about the involvement of Soldiers A-H in other lethal-force incidents in Northern Ireland.', '50.  At the preliminary hearing of 17 October 2011, it appears the MOD agreed to ask Soldiers A-H about their involvement in other such incidents.', '51.  Further statements from Soldiers A, C, D, E and G-L were served on the applicants from 2 February to 5 March 2012. Since most of those statements mentioned involvement in other lethal-force incidents, on 16 February 2012 the applicants requested this information from the coroner. The coroner obtained the parties’ written and oral observations and, on 1 March 2012, he obtained the soldiers’ personnel files as well as MOD information about their participation in other lethal-force incidents. On 8 March 2012 he ruled against the applicants, except in the case of one incident involving Soldier A. A statement from Soldier A as regards that incident was provided on 8 March 2012 as was, on application, further information about that other shooting. On 12 March 2012 the High Court (Weatherup J) refused leave to apply for judicial review of the coroner’s ruling of 8 March. It also indicated that, since the inquest had begun after years of waiting, only exceptional circumstances could justify interrupting it and there was nothing exceptional about the application warranting leave at that point. Further to a question to Soldier J about his involvement in other lethal incidents, on 15 March 2012 the coroner ruled out any further questions about the soldiers’ involvement in other lethal-force incidents and he directed the removal of references to such incidents from their statements.', '52.  On 23 March 2012 the coroner excluded reference to the material about Soldier A’s involvement in two other lethal-force incidents and the first applicant applied for leave to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of that exclusion. In the meantime, Soldier A gave evidence at the inquest excluding any reference to his involvement in other lethal-force incidents: the coroner undertook (and the MOD agreed) that Soldier A could be recalled should the result of the pending judicial review action be in the applicants’ favour. On finishing his evidence, the coroner reminded Soldier A that he might be recalled and the latter confirmed that he would be available. On 28 March 2012 the High Court found in favour of the applicants as regards one of the other lethal-force incidents concerning Soldier A. He remained available and could be questioned at the inquest the following day so that any disruption of the inquest would be justified, the issue being so “fundamental” to the character of the inquest as to amount to an exceptional case where judicial review could intervene prior to the conclusion of the inquest.', '53.  On 29 March 2012 the applicants raised Soldier A’s recall with the coroner: the MOD said he would be available, after his holiday, for the week commencing 9 April 2012. On 2 April 2012 the MOD advised the coroner that Soldier A was out of the jurisdiction and, apart from a holiday in the near future, no difficulty was raised as to his attendance. Soldier A’s attendance was revisited at length by the coroner on 4 April 2012: Soldier A would have separate legal representation and the future inquest hearing dates were fixed around juror commitment and Soldier A’s holiday plans (by then announced). On 6 April 2012 the coroner directed that Soldier A make himself available to the inquest on 11 April 2012.', '54.  On 11 April 2012 Soldier A did not appear: his solicitors sent an e‑mail to the effect that he was, in fact, beginning three weeks’ holiday that day, that he would attend thereafter but that he wished to take legal advice beforehand. On 12 April 2012 submissions were heard on this issue. In the meantime and subject to his later attending, documents concerning Soldier A’s involvement in other lethal incidents were read to the jury. On 13 April 2012 the coroner asked the MOD to address conflicting information about Soldier A’s availability. On 16 and 18 April 2012 the applicants requested the coroner to obtain a subpoena. Soldier A’s solicitors said they had no instructions but were forwarding correspondence to him. Having invited, received and considered further submissions from the applicants as regards the subpoena request, on 23 April 2012 the coroner ruled that he would conclude the inquest without Soldier A’s attendance since there was more value in completing the inquest than in speculatively trying to seek his attendance on the basis of “some open-ended review of his availability”. He directed the jury as regards Soldier A’s absence.\\n(b)  Inquest: question from the jury', '55.  During their deliberations, the jury sent a question to the coroner asking if a shot fired into a corpse could legally be defined as excessive force. This concerned the additional two shots directed at Mr Grew while he was on the ground: the pathologists had not agreed on whether he was already dead when those shots were fired. The coroner indicated that, strictly speaking, the interest of the inquest evaporated once the person was dead. The applicants unsuccessfully challenged this direction as too narrow since, notably, this incident was pertinent to the individual soldier’s conduct and as to “how” the deceased died.\\n(c)  Inquest: discharge of a juror', '56.  Between 20 March and 26 April 2012 a number of applications were made to the coroner about a juror who had allegedly fallen asleep on certain occasions and acted in a manner hostile to the next-of-kin. The coroner rejected the applicants’ requests to discharge the juror, indicating that he would keep the juror under scrutiny and the matter under review. Further to the same juror allegedly spitting in the street near family members of one of the deceased, the coroner refused a further application to discharge the juror on 27 April 2012 but he warned the jury twice about their joint responsibility for the integrity of the process, indicating on the second occasion that he should be informed if any juror had any concern about bias on the part of a fellow juror. No complaint was made. Throughout the inquest, the coroner emphasised the need for the jury to rely only on the evidence and to consider it impartially. In the final days and in response to the applicants’ request, he again emphasised that any concern of a juror about the jury or another juror should be brought to his attention. No jury comment was received.', '57.  On 27 April 2012 the High Court (Stephens J) refused leave to apply for judicial review of this last decision of the coroner. There was no need to review the coroner’s factual assessments. Even if the High Court was wrong in that analysis, exceptional circumstances would be required to postpone the inquest after years of waiting and the removal of one juror at that point would present more difficulties than could be justified (especially as the jury had begun to deliberate). In any event, there would be a remedy available to the applicants if the jury decision went against their interests.\\n(d)  Inquest: the jury verdict', '58.  At the conclusion of the evidence, the coroner obtained the parties’ written and oral submissions and then fixed the questions for the jury to answer with its verdict. The applicants, the PSNI and the MOD made closing submissions to the jury on those questions, the applicants notably suggesting that the questions did not reflect the correct absolute-necessity test and did not allow the jury to reach a verdict capable of determining whether the force used was justified. The coroner summed up to the jury for approximately four hours.', '59.  On 2 May 2012 the jury rendered its verdict to the effect that the deceased died of multiple injuries and multiple high-velocity bullet wounds.', '60.  The jury considered that the purpose of the operation was to continue surveillance, to arrest anyone involved in terrorist activity and to place a camera in the area of the shed. The soldiers opened fire and shot the deceased in the belief that their position was compromised and that their lives were in danger as, possibly alerted to the soldiers’ radio “tones”, the deceased were approaching the soldiers with their guns at the ready. The soldiers continued firing believing that their own rounds were incoming fire. Soldier A opened fire (believing that their position had been compromised and their lives were in danger) and Soldiers B, C and D followed and continued firing until they believed the threat was neutralised, in which circumstances the jury believed the soldiers had used reasonable force. Soldier D fired two bullets at close quarters into Mr Grew on the ground as he perceived Mr Grew as a threat and Soldier D’s reaction was reasonable. As to whether the jury considered there was another reasonable course of action, the jury was not “unanimous on the balance of probabilities” as to whether there was an opportunity to arrest prior to the soldiers feeling compromised. In answer, therefore, to the question about whether the operation was conducted in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any recourse to lethal force, the jury was not “unanimous in regard to the possibility of an arrest option”.', '61.  As to whether any aspect of the training of, or planning by, any soldier could account for the deaths, the jury found that the soldiers fired, in accordance with their training, at the “central mass” and continued to do so until the threat was neutralised but that, otherwise, there was “insufficient evidence of planning and intelligence available to give further findings”. Other than noting that Desmond Grew received two bullets on the ground near the shed, it was “not possible to reach any further conclusions concerning the force used against Mr Grew”.', '62.  As to whether the operation was planned, controlled and supervised by the RUC and the military so as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any recourse to lethal force, the jury responded as follows:\\n“Planning\\n– In planning the operation, TCG tasked a specialist military unit as the most appropriate unit to minimise danger to RUC members and soldiers involved in the surveillance operation and the placing of a camera.\\n– The placing of the camera was in itself planned to minimise the risk to those on surveillance.\\n– Given the level of risk involved in the surveillance operation, the specialist military unit were commissioned due to their particular training and firepower which was superior to that of the RUCs.\\n– There was no definitive information or intelligence available to minimise any recourse to lethal force.\\nControl\\n- Each individual involved had specific roles and there was no ambiguity — clear lines of command.\\n- Clear roles for everyone involved and TCG were the only ones who could call off the operation.\\nSupervision\\n- Soldier H had overall control of the operation but Soldier A was the team leader who was in command of the soldiers on the ground and therefore in the best position to make decisions and minimise to the greatest extent possible any recourse to lethal force.”', '63.  The jury highlighted, as important contributing factors, the history of incidents directed towards security forces in the area, the nature of terrorism in Northern Ireland at the time, as well as the heightened state of the minds of the soldiers involved in the operation.', '64.  On 29 June 2012 the first applicant requested leave to apply for judicial review of the inquest requesting, inter alia, the quashing of the verdict and a new inquest on the basis that the inquest was not compliant with the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the Convention.', '65.  She contested the coroner’s decisions not to admit probative material concerning the involvement of the soldiers in other lethal-force incidents in Northern Ireland including his refusal to disclose relevant material, his decision not to allow the next-of-kin to question military witnesses about such incidents and his ruling that references to such incidents be edited from the soldiers’ statements. These decisions deprived the applicants of effective and full participation in the inquest; meant that there was insufficient public scrutiny of the inquest; and deprived the jury of probative evidence in relation to whether the specialist military unit was involved in a shoot-to-kill policy, whether that unit was therefore more likely to have recourse to unjustified lethal or excessive force and whether the individual soldier’s use of lethal force was justified in the circumstances.', '66.  She also argued that the coroner failed to take adequate steps to ensure Soldier A’s attendance despite the prior High Court judgment and that this deficiency had had the same negative consequences for the applicants’ participation in the inquest, public scrutiny of the inquest and the availability of probative material for the jury. She maintained that the questions put by the coroner to the jury failed to ensure that the jury could properly address “how” and “in what circumstances” the deceased came by their deaths. She also argued that the coroner misdirected the jury on the soldiers’ “state of belief” when they opened fire and continued to fire, that he failed to direct them to consider the “absolute necessity” of the use of the force used and that he failed to direct the jury properly in response to its question about shooting at a corpse. She claimed that the coroner failed to correct errors in the parties’ closing submissions to the jury. Finally, she challenged the coroner’s refusal to discharge the juror hostile to the next-of-kin so that the jury was neither fair, impartial nor independent.', '67.

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Primošten.', '6.  On 31 March 2003 the Šibenik Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Šibeniku) indicted the applicant in the Šibenik Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Šibeniku) on charges of attempted grievous bodily harm.', '7.  The first hearing before the Šibenik Municipal Court was scheduled for 16 March 2006.', '8.  On the day of the hearing, the applicant informed the Šibenik Municipal Court that he was unable to appear at the hearing owing to a medical condition. He also submitted medical documentation in that regard.', '9.  Several witnesses also failed to attend the hearing and the applicant’s lawyer informed the trial court that she no longer represented the applicant. The hearing was adjourned and the next hearing was scheduled for 26 April 2006.', '10.  At the hearing of 26 April 2006 the applicant, who was not properly summoned, failed to appear. The president of the trial panel ordered that the applicant be summoned by a letter indicating that his defence lawyer no longer represented him and that he should either appoint another lawyer or the hearing would be held in the absence of a lawyer.', '11.  On 22 May 2006 the applicant informed the Šibenik Municipal Court that he was not able to appear for trial owing to his medical condition. He explained that he would be unavailable for a certain period of time because he was required to undergo medical treatment and promised to inform the court of the progress of that treatment. He therefore asked that the proceedings be stayed until he was able to appear at the hearings. The applicant also submitted back-up medical documentation.', '12.  At a hearing on 23 May 2006 the Deputy State Attorney asked the trial court to commission a medical report concerning the applicant’s capacity to take part in the proceedings given his state of health.', '13.  On 30 May 2006 a medical expert, M.D.G., submitted a report indicating that the applicant suffered from heart arrhythmia. She considered that he would not be able to take part in the hearings for a period of time which was hard to predict. She therefore suggested that the trial court re-examine his condition after a month.', '14.  On 11 August 2006 the Šibenik Municipal Court invited the applicant to submit medical documentation noting the progress of his treatment.', '15.  The applicant complied with the order and submitted the documentation on 16 August 2006. The Šibenik Municipal Court then commissioned another medical report.', '16.  On 13 September 2006 medical expert M.D.G. submitted a further report, indicating that the applicant’s state of health had not stabilised despite the medical treatment he had been receiving and that he could not appear at the hearings. She reiterated that it was not possible to predict the exact period of time in which he would not be able to take part in the proceedings and suggested that his condition be reassessed at appropriate intervals.', '17.  Another medical report was commissioned on 13 March 2007 from a forensic expert, a cardiologist and a psychiatrist.', '18.  On 15 April 2007 the medical experts, M.D.G., D.M. and D.B., submitted a joint report. They found that the applicant was not able to take part in the hearings and that a strong triggering factor, such as stress, could lead to a heart attack with a possibly fatal outcome.', '19.  On 23 April 2007 the Šibenik Municipal Court commissioned a further medical report from medical experts M.D.G., D.M. and D.B.', '20.  The medical experts submitted their report on 19 June 2007, in which they noted:\\n“... we still consider that the accused’s appearance at the hearing would be a risk factor which could (although it might not) lead to a heart attack, and how that will further develop it is hard to predict, which makes Stipe Petrina theoretically unable to appear at the hearing.\\nHowever, we consider that his appearance at the hearing would be possible only in the presence of [a] doctor, namely a medical team equipped for prompt intervention in the event of a heart attack at the trial.”', '21.  The Šibenik Municipal Court scheduled a hearing for 20 November 2007. It summoned the applicant, the applicant’s lawyer, B.B., whose services he had engaged on 11 October 2007, and a cardiologist, A.S., to the hearing.', '22.  At a hearing on 20 November 2007 the Šibenik Municipal Court noted that the applicant’s defence lawyer had informed it on 19 November 2007 that she could not attend the hearing because she was on maternity leave. The applicant was not properly summoned and did not attend the hearing. The cardiologist, A.S., did not attend the hearing, nor did he excuse his absence. The hearing was adjourned and the next hearing was scheduled for 19 December 2007.', '23.  On 13 December 2007 the applicant informed the Šibenik Municipal Court that he could not appear at the hearing scheduled for 19 December 2007 due to his medical condition. He referred to the medical expert report of 19 June 2007.', '24.  On 19 December 2007 the Šibenik Municipal Court, relying on Article 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 34 below), dismissed the applicant’s request for adjournment as abusive on the grounds that the necessary medical back-up had been secured by summoning the cardiologist, A.S., to the hearing. The court considered that the applicant was trying to delay the proceedings. It also found that, according to the information available to it, the applicant had taken part in a number of other court proceedings as claimant and private prosecutor.', '25.  On the same date, the Šibenik Municipal Court held a hearing at which the applicant did not appear and to which his defence counsel had not been summoned. The cardiologist, A.S., again did not attend the hearing, nor did he excuse his absence. The hearing was held in the presence of the Deputy State Attorney and the victim’s representative. After the hearing, at which the trial court examined the evidence and written records of witnesses’ oral statements, it found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment, suspended for one year.', '26.  On 27 June 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal before the Šibenik County Court (Županijski sud u Šibeniku) against the decision to hold a hearing in his absence. The applicant complained that he had not been able to appear at the hearing owing to his medical condition and that the trial court’s findings that he had taken part in a number of other court proceedings had been unsubstantiated and untrue, as while he had been a party to the other proceedings he had never taken part in the trials.', '27.  On 17 and 18 July 2008 the applicant lodged further statements of appeal before the Šibenik County Court asking that court to quash the first-instance judgment and to order a retrial. He reiterated that the hearing of 19 December 2007 had been held in his absence, even though he had not been able to appear at the hearing owing to his medical condition. He also complained that the necessary medical back-up at the hearing had not been ensured, as a medical team had never been obtained and the cardiologist, A.S., had twice failed to attend the hearings. Moreover, the defence had never been informed that a back-up medical team would be provided, and had the trial court considered that he was abusing his procedural rights, it should have ensured that he had legal representation at the trial.', '28.  During the appeal proceedings, the Šibenik County State Attorney’s Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Šibeniku), which represented the prosecution case on appeal, asked the Šibenik County Court to allow the applicant’s appeal and to order a retrial.', '29.  On 10 October 2008 the Šibenik County Court, in closed session, without holding a hearing, dismissed all the appeals and upheld the first-instance judgment. That court found that the applicant had been abusing his procedural rights and that he had been doing nothing more than trying to delay the trial.', '30.  On 10 February 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) complaining that the hearing before the first-instance court had been held in his absence.', '31.

The applicant Doroshok claimed compensation of health damage and severe injuries caused during his military mission in Chechnya. The applicants Sobakar and Sereda claimed a recalculation of their pensions and a compensation of shortfalls in monthly payments made in the past.', '8.  The domestic courts granted the applicants’ claims (see dates of the judgments and sums awarded in the appended table). The judgments were not appealed against in cassation and became binding and enforceable on the dates indicated in the appended table. However, only one of these judgments was enforced (the judgment of 13 May 2003 in favour of V. Kashcheyev, see paragraph 12 below). All the other judgments, including the second judgment in favour of V. Kashcheyev delivered on 14 July 2006, were not enforced.', '9.  On various dates the Presidiums of higher courts decided, upon the defendant authorities’ requests for supervisory review, to quash the judgments in the applicants’ favour considering that the lower courts misapplied the material law (see details in the appended table).

In the case of Kulkov, the Presidium of the Privolzhskiy Circuit Military Court quashed on 18 April 2002 the judgment in the applicant’s favour by way of supervisory review initiated by the President of this court. However, the judgment of 18 April 2002 was itself overruled by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 11 April 2003 and the first-instance judgment in the applicant’s favour was thus restored. It remained in force until it was quashed for a second time on 25 December 2003 by the Presidium of the Privolzhskiy Circuit Military Court upon application of the defendant military unit. While dismissing the applicant’s claims for field allowance (RUB 70,675), the Presidium upheld the first-instance court’s decision as regards the award of the regional bonus to the applicant (RUB 1,112.33).', '11.  In the case of Shelestovskaya, the Presidium of the Moscow Circuit Military Court quashed on 7 April 2004 the judgment in the applicant’s favour. However, the judgment of 7 April 2004 was itself overruled by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 12 August 2004 and the first-instance judgment in the applicant’s favour was thus restored.

The Presidium dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claims.', '12.  The first of the two judgments, which was delivered in favour of V. Kashcheyev on 13 May 2003 and became enforceable on 26 May 2003, was enforced on 15 September 2005.

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Béziers.', '6.  The applicant is the former head of the Basque separatist organisation Iparretarrak. After his detention in 1988, he was convicted several times: on 4 March 1991 he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for criminal association with a view to preparing a terrorist offence; on 10 November 1992 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in the framework of terrorist activity, killing two members of the State security police force (“CRS”); on 9 April 1993 he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for armed robbery; on 9 June 1993 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in the framework of terrorist activity, killing a gendarme; and on 31 March 2000 he was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for conspiracy to murder, complicity in murder and armed robbery.', '7.  By judgment of 1 February 2007 the Sentence enforcement division of the Paris Court of Appeal released him on licence from 14 February 2007 to 14 February 2014, ordering to follow a seven-year programme of assistance and supervision. The Government pointed out that the applicant was the first person sentenced to life imprisonment for offences linked to terrorism ever to have been released on licence.', '8.  The Sentence enforcement division reiterated in its judgment that the applicant’s release on licence would be accompanied by the following general obligations (Article 132-44 of the Penal Code): complying with the instructions of the sentence enforcement judge or of the social worker from the Prison rehabilitation and probation service; receiving visits from the latter and providing him or her with information or documents facilitating supervision of his livelihood and compliance with his obligations; informing the social worker of any job changes and, if such changes are liable to hamper compliance with his obligations, obtaining prior authorisation from the sentence enforcement judge; informing the social worker of any changes of address and of any travel lasting for more than two weeks, reporting back to the latter on his return; and obtaining the authorisation of the sentence enforcement judge for any foreign travel and for any change of job or of address liable to impede compliance with his obligations. The division added the following special obligations (Article 132-45 [1], [3], [5] and [14] of the Penal Code): exercising an occupation or following vocational education or training; residing in Béziers; continuing, in accordance with his means, to pay into the Guarantee Fund for the compensation of victims of terrorism; and refraining from possessing or carrying a weapon.', '9.  On 7 November 2007 the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the Public Prosecutor with the Paris Court of Appeal.', '10.  On 24 December 2007 the applicant took part in a peaceful demonstration outside Agen Prison in support of Basque detainees being held there. The media reported on that demonstration.', '11.  Consequently, the Paris Sentence Enforcement Court delivered a judgment on 14 May 2008 imposing additional special obligations on the applicant: refraining from attending, in the vicinity of a prison or other detention facility, any demonstration in support of persons detained for terrorist offences or of any association or movement which is committing or has committed terrorist acts (Article 135-45 [9] of the Penal Code); refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or co-produced by himself concerning, in whole or in part, an offence committed by himself, and refraining from discussing that offence in public (Article 132-45 [16] of the Penal Code).', '12.  That judgment was upheld by judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal on 2 October 2008. However, the latter judgment was quashed by judgment of the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation on 10 June 2009, on the grounds that the sentence enforcement court did not have jurisdiction to modify the obligations for release on licence, for which matter the sentence enforcement judge held jurisdiction.', '13.  On 18 February 2010 the Public Prosecutor’s Office requested that the sentence enforcement judge of the Regional Court of Paris add both the aforementioned obligations to the applicant’s list of obligations for release on licence, as well as a prohibition on “contacting any person actively engaged in promoting Basque separatism or supporting detainees convicted of or charged with terrorist acts pursuant to Articles 421-1 to 421-6 of the Penal Code, particularly with a view to expressing support for such detainees (Article 132-42 [12] of the Penal Code)”.', '14.  By judgment of 28 June 2010 the sentence enforcement judge decided to impose on the applicant the obligation set out in Article 132-45 (16) of the Penal Code: “refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or co-produced by himself concerning, in whole or in part, the offence committed, and refraining from discussing that offence in public, whereby [these] provisions [are] applicable only in cases of convictions for serious offences of intentional homicide, sexual assault or sexual abuse”. He noted that in its judgment of 1 February 2007 the Paris Court of Appeal had described the applicant “as a calm, respectful person who spent most of his time writing his memoirs”. The judge inferred that “although it is unclear what the word ‘memoirs’ entails, it is quite possible that Mr Bidart might be tempted to publish his memoirs and make statements on the offences of which he was convicted”. Nor did the judgment go into further detail on that point. It explained, however, that “during the adversarial proceedings Mr Bidart was reminded that the prosecution had requested the prohibition only of writings or statements connected with the offences of which he had been convicted”.', '15.  That judgment was upheld by judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal on 31 August 2010, stating that the obligation in question “merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed” and “that the obligation was not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order, nor does it prevent Philippe Bidart from expressing his political convictions”.', '16.  By judgment of 30 March 2011 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant, on the grounds that in its judgment the Court of Appeal had properly applied Article 132-45 [16] of the Penal Code, in compliance with the legal texts and conventions relevant to the applicant’s appeal (including Article 10 of the Convention).\\n...'], 'applicants': ['BIDART'], 'defendants': ['FRANCE'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['16', '17']}, 'silver_rationales': [11], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [11], 'explained_indices': [1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'explained_distances': [0.54426044, 0.49746716, 0.35548612, 0.06460798, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736, 0.02675736], 'number_of_sentences': 12, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

That newspaper was replaced on 31 May 2001 by a weekly periodical called Yedinci Gündem.', \"10.  At the material time one of the applicants, Mr Çetin, an independent journalist, wrote a column entitled “Notes from Diyarbakir” (Diyarbakir'dan Notlar), which was published on Tuesdays in Ülkede Gündem.

Mr Sünbül continues to work as a journalist with the weekly publication 7. Gündem, while Mr Dag currently works as a press officer for Kayapinar Town Council.', '12.  The main point at issue in the present case is a ban that was imposed on 1 December 1997 by the governor of the state of emergency region on the distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.', '13.  According to the applicants, the distribution of Ülkede Gündem was impeded by the security forces in the period from September to November 1997, and the governor of the state of emergency region subsequently imposed a ban on its publication and distribution in the region where the state of emergency had been declared (see paragraph 24 below). On 13 November 1997 the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior informing it of the disruption caused to the distribution of the newspaper and demanding an end to these unlawful acts. He also sought compensation for the loss sustained.', '14.  On 19 November 1997 the governor of the state of emergency region wrote to the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem to say that his office was not responsible for the acts mentioned in the letter. He enclosed the seizure orders that had been made by the relevant authorities.', '15.  The Government have produced to the Court seventy-two warrants issued by judges of the Istanbul National Security Court for the seizure of various issues of the newspaper in the months of September, November and December 1997.', \"16.  On 4 November 1997 Mr Bakaç and Mr Bagir lodged a criminal complaint with the Diyarbakir public prosecutor's office because of the alleged disruption to the distribution of the newspaper.\", \"17.  On 25 November 1997 the public prosecutor's office ruled that it had no power to deal with the complaint and referred it to the Diyarbakir Administrative Council under the Prosecution of Civil Servants Act.\", '18.  On 5 February 1998 the Diyarbakir Administrative Council held that there was no case to answer in view of the seizure warrants that had been issued by the Istanbul National Security Court. Its decision was upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on 3 March 2000.', '19.  On 1 December 1997 the governor of the state of emergency region imposed a ban on the publication and distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.', \"20.  On 4 December 1997 the Diyarbakir Security Directorate wrote to Mr Bakaç, in his capacity as Ülkede Gündem's representative in Diyarbakir, informing him of the ban.

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Istanbul.', '6.  On 29 October 2003, while attempting to participate in a demonstration in the form of “a press conference” held on Istiklal Street in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, the applicant was arrested, together with some 50 to 60 other participants, by police officers at approximately 4.10 p.m. The applicant alleged that the police officers had used disproportionate force to disperse the crowd and to arrest the demonstrators, whereas the Government claimed that the demonstrators had resisted the police and had refused to disperse.', \"7.  Following her arrest the applicant was taken to hospital for a medical examination. The doctor who examined her reported that there were no signs of injury on the applicant's body. The doctor noted, however, that the applicant complained of pain in her right upper arm.\", \"8.  On the same date, at 7.30 p.m., the applicant was questioned by the Beyoğlu public prosecutor. The applicant informed the public prosecutor that she had been subjected to ill-treatment by the police, who had used disproportionate force during her arrest. She claimed that she had attended the meeting, organised by a group called “the Peace Mothers' Initiative”, as the President of the Istanbul Human Rights Association, and that she had been arrested by the police for no reason. She stated that she had merely exercised her legal rights and that she had not breached the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act (Law no. 2911).\", '9.  The applicant was released from police custody on the same day, after being questioned by the Beyoğlu public prosecutor.', '10.  On 6 November 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Beyoğlu public prosecutor against the police officers who had been involved in the incident and had arrested her. She complained, inter alia, of the unlawfulness of her arrest and the excessive use of force by the police during the arrest.', '11.  On the same date the applicant was referred to the Istanbul branch of the Forensic Medical Institute by the Beyoğlu public prosecutor. The doctor who examined the applicant noted a 2 x 6 cm ecchymosis on the back of her left leg and concluded that the injury rendered the applicant unfit for work for five days. The doctor further noted that the applicant was suffering from pain in her right shoulder and right arm.', \"12.  On 12 November 2004 the Beyoğlu public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute the police officers who had been on duty at the press conference of 29 October 2003. Relying on the incident report prepared by the police officers, the public prosecutor noted that, despite warnings by the police, the demonstrators, who had gathered illegally without obtaining permission and had disturbed public order by blocking the pedestrian zone and tramway, had refused to disperse and the police had therefore been obliged to use some degree of force to disperse them and restore public order. The public prosecutor considered that the force used by the security forces had been in line with section 24 of the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act and had been justified in the circumstances. In the public prosecutor's opinion, the applicant's injuries were the result of a proportionate use of force which did not amount to ill-treatment or abuse of authority.\", '13.  On 23 December 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Istanbul Assize Court against the above-mentioned decision of the public prosecutor. She claimed that on 29 October 2003 police officers had beaten her during her arrest, causing injuries rendering her unfit for work for five days, as corroborated by the medical report from the hospital. She further alleged that the participants had not blocked the tramway or pedestrian traffic. She therefore asked the Assize Court to order the prosecuting authorities to bring charges against the police officers.', \"14.  On 30 December 2004, having regard to the content of the file and the reasons given by the Beyoğlu public prosecutor, the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the applicant's appeal.\", \"15.  The Istanbul Assize Court's decision was served on the applicant on 16 February 2005.\", '16.  In the meantime, on 7 November 2003, the Beyoğlu public prosecutor had brought charges against thirteen demonstrators, including the applicant, for violation of the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act. In her defence submissions before the court, the applicant claimed that, in participating in the demonstration, she had merely been exercising her democratic rights.', \"17.  In a judgment dated 19 December 2006, the Beyoğlu Assize Court acquitted the applicant and her co-accused of the above-mentioned charges. The court held as follows:\\n“[It] was alleged that the accused had breached the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act on the day of the incident. Having regard to the content of the case file, there is no convincing evidence indicating with sufficient certainty that the accused committed the alleged offence. It appears from the incident report that the security forces took measures following an intelligence report that the Peace Mothers' Initiative, Gök-Der, Tuad and Yakay-Der associations were to hold a demonstration in front of the post office in the Galatasaray district. After the gathering of the group (demonstrators), the chair of the association Yakay-Der stated that they would stage a sit-in in front of the Galatasaray post office. Following a police warning [that the meeting was unlawful], the demonstrators told the police that they would make a press statement and then disperse. However, the police teams did not release the group and continued to keep them within a circle; they then arrested them without giving a proper warning that could be heard by everyone (no evidence was provided to substantiate the assertion that a warning was given). For these reasons, no evidence was adduced to indicate that the accused committed the alleged offence in contravention of the said Act and that [their action] went beyond the exercise of their democratic rights. It is thus considered that the actions of the accused were merely an exercise of their democratic rights [to freedom of assembly].

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Moscow.', '6.  On 6 May 2012 the applicant was arrested during the dispersal of a political rally at Bolotnaya Square in Moscow. He was detained at the police station for at least thirty-six hours pending administrative proceedings in which he was found guilty of failure to obey lawful police orders, an offence under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and sentenced to fifteen days’ administrative detention. The parties’ submissions on the circumstances surrounding the public assembly and its dispersal are set out in part A, and the specific facts relating to the applicant are set out in part B below.', '7.  On 23 April 2012 five individuals (Mr I. Bakirov, Mr S. Davidis, Ms Y. Lukyanova, Ms N. Mityushkina and Mr S. Udaltsov) submitted notice of a public demonstration to the mayor of Moscow. The march, with an estimated 5,000 participants, was to begin at 4 p.m. on 6 May 2012 from Triumfalnaya Square followed by a meeting at Manezhnaya Square, which was to end at 8 p.m. The aim of the demonstration was “to protest against abuses and falsifications in the course of the elections to the State Duma and of the President of the Russian Federation, and to demand fair elections, respect for human rights, the rule of law and the international obligations of the Russian Federation”.', '8.  On 26 April 2012 the Head of the Moscow Department of Regional Security, Mr A. Mayorov, informed the organisers that the requested route could not be allocated because of preparations for the Victory Day parade on 9 May 2012. They proposed that the organisers hold the march between Luzhniki Street and Frunzenskaya embankment.', '9.  On 27 April 2012 the organisers declined the proposal and requested an alternative route from Kaluzhskaya Square, down Bolshaya Yakimanka Street and Bolshaya Polyanka Street, followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square. The march was to begin at 4 p.m., and the meeting had to finish by 7.30 p.m. The number of participants was indicated as 5,000.', '10.  On 3 May 2012 the Moscow Department of Regional Security approved the alternative route, having noted that the organisers had provided a detailed plan of the proposed events.', '11.  On 3 May 2012 the Moscow Department of Regional Security informed the Chief of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Mr V. Kolokoltsev, that a different group of organisers had submitted notification of another public event – a meeting at Manezhnaya Square – which the Moscow authorities had rejected. The organisers of that event had expressed their intention to proceed in defiance of the ban and to squat on the square from 6 to 10 May 2012, ready to resist the police if necessary. The Department of the Interior was therefore requested to safeguard public order in Moscow.', '12.  At 8 p.m. on 4 May 2012 the First Deputy Head of the Moscow Department of Regional Security, Mr V. Oleynik, held a working meeting with the organisers of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, at which they discussed the security issues. The Deputy Chief of the Public Order Directorate of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Police Colonel D. Deynichenko, took part in the meeting. The organisers stated at the meeting that the turnout could significantly exceed the expected 5,000 participants. They were warned that exceeding the number originally declared would be unacceptable. According to the applicant, during that meeting the organisers and the authorities agreed that since there was insufficient time for an on-the-spot reconnaissance, which would otherwise have been carried out, the assembly layout and the security arrangements would be identical to the previous public event organised by the same group of opposition activists on 4 February 2012. On that occasion, the march had proceeded down Yakimanka Street, followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square, and the venue of the meeting had included the park at Bolotnaya Square (in some documents referred to as “Repin park”) and the Bolotnaya embankment.', '13.  On the same day the deputy mayor of Moscow, Mr A. Gorbenko, instructed the Tsentralnyy district prefect to assist the organisers in maintaining public order and security during the event. He ordered the Moscow Department of Regional Security to inform the organisers that their assembly notice had been accepted and to monitor its implementation. Other public agencies were assigned the duties of street cleaning, traffic control and ensuring the presence of ambulances at the site of the assembly.', '14.  On 5 May 2012 the Moscow Department of Regional Security requested the Moscow City Prosecutor’s Office to issue a warning to the organisers against exceeding the notified number of participants and against erecting camping tents at the meeting venue, an intention allegedly expressed by the organisers at the working meeting. The Moscow Department of Regional Security also referred to information found on the Internet that the demonstrators would go to Manezhnaya Square after the meeting. On the same day the Tsentralnyy District Prosecutor’s Office issued the relevant warning to two of the organisers, Mr Davidis and Mr Udaltsov.', '15.  On the same day the Moscow Department of the Interior published on its website the official information about the forthcoming demonstration on 6 May 2012, including a map. The map indicated the route of the march, the traffic restrictions and an access plan to Bolotnaya Square; it delineated the area allotted to the meeting, which included the park at Bolotnaya Square. Access to the meeting was marked through the park.', '16.  On the same day the Police Chief of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Police Major-General V. Golovanov, adopted a plan for safeguarding public order in Moscow on 6 May 2012 (the “security plan”). The ninety-nine-page security plan was an internal document which had not been disclosed to the public or to the organisers. In view of the forthcoming authorised demonstration at Bolotnaya Square and anticipated attempts by other opposition groups to hold unauthorised public gatherings, it provided for security measures in Moscow city centre and set up operational headquarters to implement them.', '17.  Thirty-two high-ranking police officers, including eight major-generals, two military commanders and one emergency-relief official, were appointed to the operational headquarters. The Deputy Police Chief of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Police Major-General V.

Khaustov, and the Deputy Chief of the Public Order Directorate of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Police Colonel D. Deynichenko, were appointed as deputy heads of the operational headquarters.', '18.  The security plan provided for an 8,094-strong crowd-control taskforce, comprising the police and the military, to police the designated security areas and to prevent unauthorised public gatherings and terrorist attacks. The main contingent was the police squad charged with cordon and riot-control duties in accordance with a structured and detailed action plan for each operational unit. Furthermore, it provided for a 785-strong police unit assigned to operational posts across the city centre, with responsibility for apprehending offenders, escorting them to police stations and drawing up administrative offence reports. They were instructed, in particular, to prepare templates for the administrative offence reports and to have at least forty printed copies of them at every police station. The security plan also provided for a 350-strong police unit for intercepting and apprehending organisers and instigators of unauthorised gatherings. The squad had to be equipped with full protection gear and police batons. Each unit had to ensure effective radio communication within the chain of command. They were instructed to keep loudspeakers, metal detectors, handcuffs, fire extinguishers and wire clippers in the police vehicles.', '19.  The security plan set out in detail the allocation and deployment of police vehicles, police buses, interception and monitoring vehicles and equipment, dog-handling teams, fire-fighting and rescue equipment, ambulances and a helicopter. It also made provision for a 1,815-strong reserve unit equipped with gas masks, aerosol grenades (“Dreif”), flash grenades (“Zarya‑2”), bang grenades (“Fakel” and “Fakel-C”), a 40-mm hand-held grenade launcher (“Gvozd” 6Г-30), and a 43-mm hand-held grenade launcher (ГМ-94); tubeless pistols (ПБ-4СП) with 23-mm rubber bullets and propelling cartridges, and rifles (KC-23). Two water-cannon vehicles were ordered to be on standby, ready to be used against persistent offenders.', '20.  All units were instructed to be vigilant and thorough in detecting and eliminating security threats and to be polite and tactful in their conduct vis‑à-vis citizens, engaging in a lawful dialogue with them without responding to provocations. If faced with an unauthorised gathering they were instructed to give a warning through a loudspeaker, to arrest the most active participants and to record video footage of those incidents. The police chiefs were instructed to place plain-clothes officers among the protesters in order to monitor the threat of violence and terrorist attacks within the crowd and to take measures, where appropriate, to prevent and mitigate the damage and to pursue the perpetrators.', '21.  The Chief of the Interior Department of the Tsentralnyy Administrative District of Moscow, Police Major-General V. Paukov, was required, among other tasks, to prepare, together with the organisers, the text of the public announcement to be made if the situation deteriorated. The head of the press communication service of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Internal Service Lieutenant-Colonel Y. Alekseyeva, was in charge of communication with the press. The head of the Department for Liaison with Civil Society of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Internal Service Colonel V. Biryukov, had to ensure “coordination with the representatives of public organisations and also coordination and information flow with other services of the Moscow Department of the Interior”.', '22.  The units assigned to police the march and the meeting belonged to “Zone no. 8” (Kaluzhskaya Square, Bolotnaya Square and the adjacent territory). The zone commander was the Chief of the Riot Police of the Moscow Department of the Interior, Police Colonel P. Smirnov, with nine high-ranking police officers (Police Colonel P. Saprykin, Police Colonel A. Zdorenko, Police Lieutenant-Colonel A. Tsukernik, Police Colonel A. Kuznetsov, Police Colonel V. Yermakov, Police Colonel A. Kasatkin, Police Colonel A. Dvoynos, Police Captain R. Bautdinov and Internal Service Lieutenant-Colonel D. Bystrikov) as his deputies.', '23.  The units assigned to Zone no. 8 comprised 2,400 riot police officers, of whom 1,158 were on duty at Bolotnaya Square. They were instructed, in particular, to search the demonstrators to prevent them from taking camping tents to the site of the meeting and to obstruct access to Bolshoy Kamenyy bridge, diverting the marchers to Bolotnaya embankment, the site of the meeting. The adjacent park at Bolotnaya Square had to be cordoned off, and the only entrance to Bolotnaya embankment – from Malyy Kamenny bridge – had to be equipped with fourteen metal detectors, which were to be removed just before the march approached the site of the meeting. An exception was made for the organisers and the technical staff, who were allowed access behind the stage through two additional metal detectors. Further arrangements were made for access of the press.', '24.  Lastly, the command of Zone no. 8, in particular Police Colonels Smirnov and Saprykin, were under orders to meet the organisers in person at the beginning of the event to remind them of their responsibilities and to have them sign an undertaking. The organisers would undertake to ensure the lawful and safe conduct of the event, and to refrain from any calls for forced change of the constitutional order and from hate speech and propaganda in favour of violence or war. They would also undertake to be present at the venue until the end of the assembly and the departure of the participants. A video recording of the briefing and the signing of the undertaking had to be made.', '25.  At about 1.30 p.m. on 6 May 2012 the organisers were allowed access to Bolotnaya Square to set up the stage and sound equipment. The police searched the vehicles delivering the equipment and seized three tents found amid the gear. They arrested several people for bringing the tents, and the installation of the equipment was delayed. During that time communication between the organisers setting up the stage and those leading the march was sporadic.', '26.  At the beginning of the march, Police Colonel A. Makhonin met the organisers at Kaluzhskaya Square to clarify any outstanding organisational matters and to have them sign the undertaking to ensure public order during the demonstration. He specifically asked Mr Udaltsov to ensure that no tents were placed on Bolotnaya Square and that the participants complied with the limits on the place and time allocated for the assembly. The organisers gave their assurances on those issues and signed the undertaking.', '27.  The march began at 4.30 p.m. at Kaluzhskaya Square. It went down Yakimanka Street peacefully and without disruption. The turnout exceeded expectations, but there is no consensus as to the exact numbers. The official estimate was that there were 8,000 participants, whereas the organisers considered that there had been about 25,000. The media reported different numbers, some significantly exceeding the above estimates.', '28.  At about 5 p.m. the march approached Bolotnaya Square. The leaders found that the layout of the meeting and the placement of the police cordon did not correspond to what they had anticipated. Unlike on 4 February 2012, the park at Bolotnaya Square was excluded from the meeting venue, which was limited to Bolotnaya embankment. The cordon of riot police in full protection gear barred access to the park and continued along the whole perimeter of the meeting area, channelling the demonstration to Bolotnaya embankment. Further down the embankment there was a row of metal detectors at the entrance to the meeting venue. By that time the stage had been erected at the far end of Bolotnaya embankment and a considerable number of people had already accumulated in front of it.', '29.  Faced with the police cordon and unable to access the park, the leaders of the march – Mr S. Udaltsov, Mr A. Navalnyy, Mr B. Nemtsov and Mr I. Yashin – stopped and demanded that the police open access to the park. According to the protesters, they were taken aback by the alteration of the expected layout and were unwilling to turn towards Bolotnaya embankment; they therefore demanded that the police officers at the cordon move the cordon back to allow sufficient space for the protesters to pass and to assemble for the meeting. According to the official version, the protesters were not interested in proceeding to the meeting venue; they stopped because they had either intended to break the cordon in order to proceed towards Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge and then to the Kremlin, or to stir up the crowd to incite disorder. It is common ground that the cordon officers did not enter into any discussion with the protest leaders and no senior officer was delegated to negotiate. After about fifteen minutes of attempting to engage with the cordon officers, at 5.16 p.m. the four leaders announced that they were going on a “sit-down strike” and sat on the ground. The people behind them stopped, although some people continued to go past them towards the stage. The leaders of the sit-in called on other demonstrators to follow their example and sit down, but only a few of their entourage did so (between approximately twenty and fifty people in total).', '30.  Between 5.20 p.m. and 5.45 p.m. two State Duma deputies, Mr G. Gudkov and Mr D. Gudkov, contacted unidentified senior police officers to negotiate the enlargement of the restricted area by moving the police cordon behind the park along the lines expected by the organisers. At the same time Mr V. Lukin, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation, at the request of Police Colonel Biryukov, attempted to convince the leaders of the sit-in to resume the procession and to head towards the meeting venue at Bolotnaya embankment, where the stage had been set up. During that time no senior police officers or municipal officials came to the site of the sit-down protest, and there was no direct communication between the authorities and the leaders of the sit-in.', '31.  At 5.40 p.m. one of the meeting participants announced from the stage that the leaders were calling on the demonstrators to support their protest. Some people waiting in front of the stage headed back to Malyy Kamennyy bridge, either to support the sit-down protest or to leave the meeting. The area in front of the stage almost emptied.', '32.  At 5.43 p.m. the media reported that Mr Udaltsov had demanded that the protesters be given airtime on Russia’s main television channels, that the presidential inauguration of Mr Putin be cancelled and that new elections be called.', '33.  At 5.50 p.m. the crowd around the sit-down protest built up, which caused some congestion, and the leaders abandoned the protest and headed towards the stage, followed by the crowd.', '34.  At 5.55 p.m. the media reported that the police authorities were regarding the strike as a provocation of mass disorder and were considering prosecuting those responsible for it.', '35.  At the same time a commotion arose near the police cordon at the place vacated by the sit-down protest, and the police cordon was broken in several places. A crowd of about 100 people spilled over to the empty space beyond the cordon. Within seconds the police restored the cordon, which was reinforced by an additional riot police force. Those who found themselves outside the cordon wandered around, uncertain what to do next. Several people were apprehended, others were pushed back inside the cordon, and some continued to loiter outside or walked towards the park. The police cordon began to push the crowd into the restricted area and advanced by several metres, pressing it inwards.', '36.  At 6 p.m. Police Colonel Makhonin told Ms Mityushkina to make an announcement from the stage that the meeting was closed. She did so, but apparently her message was not heard by most of the demonstrators or the media reporters broadcasting from the spot. The live television footage provided by the parties contained no mention of her announcement.', '37.  At the same time a Molotov cocktail was launched from the crowd at the corner of Malyy Kamenny bridge over the restored police cordon. It landed outside the cordon and the trousers of a passer-by caught fire. The fire was promptly extinguished by the police.', '38.  At 6.15 p.m. at the same corner of Malyy Kamenny bridge the riot police began breaking into the demonstration to split the crowd. Running in tight formations, they pushed the crowd apart, arrested some people, confronted others and formed new cordons to isolate sections of the crowd. Some protesters held up metal barriers and aligned them so as to resist the police, threw various objects at the police, shouted and chanted “Shame!” and other slogans, and whenever the police apprehended anyone from among the protesters they attempted to pull them back. The police applied combat techniques and used truncheons.', '39.  At 6.20 p.m. Mr Udaltsov climbed onto the stage at the opposite end of the square to address the meeting. At that time many people were assembled in front of the stage, but, as it turned out, the sound equipment had been disconnected. Mr Udaltsov took a loudspeaker and shouted:\\n“Dear friends! Unfortunately we have no proper sound, but we will carry on our action, we are not going away because our comrades have been arrested, because tomorrow is the coronation of an illegitimate president. We shall begin an indefinite protest action. You agree? We shall not leave until our comrades are released, until the inauguration is cancelled and until we are given airtime on the central television channels. You agree? We are power here! Dear friends, [if] we came out in December [2011] and in March [2012], it was not to put up with the stolen elections, ... it was not to see the chief crook and thief on the throne. Today we have no choice – stay here or give the country to crooks and thieves for another six years. I consider that we shall not leave today. We shall not leave!”', '40.  At this point, at 6.21 p.m., several police officers arrested Mr Udaltsov and took him away. Mr Navalnyy attempted to go up onto the stage, but he was also arrested at the stairs and taken away. As he was pushed out by the police officers he turned to the crowd shouting “Nobody shall leave!”', '41.  At 6.25 p.m. the police arrested Mr Nemtsov, who had also attempted to address people from the stage.', '42.  Meanwhile, at the Malyy Kamenny bridge the police continued dividing the crowd and began pushing some sections away from the venue. Through the loudspeakers they requested the participants to leave for the metro station. The dispersal continued for at least another hour until the venue was fully cleared of all protesters.', '43.  On 6 May 2012 Police Colonel Deynichenko drew up a report summarising the security measures taken on that day in Moscow. The report stated that the march, in which about 8,000 people had participated, had begun at 4.15 p.m. and had followed the route to Bolotnaya Square. It listed the groups and organisations represented, the number of participants in each group, the number and colours of their flags and the number and content of their banners. It further stated as follows:\\n“... at 5.04 p.m. the organised column ... arrived at the [cordon] and expressed the intention to proceed straight to Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge and [to cross it] to Borovitskaya Square. The police ... ordered them to proceed to Bolotnaya Square, the venue of the meeting. However, the leaders at the head of the column – [Mr Udaltsov, Mr Nemtsov and Mr Navalnyy] – ... called on the marchers through the loudspeaker not to move. Together with some thirty protesters they sat on the ground. Another group of about twenty, called by [their leaders], sat as well. The police ... repeatedly warned them against holding an unauthorised public gathering and required them to proceed to the venue of the meeting or to leave. Besides that, two State Duma deputies, Gennadiy Gudkov and Dmitriy Gudkov, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Lukin, and a member of the Civic Chamber, Nikolay Svanidze, talked to them, but those sitting on the ground did not react and continued chanting slogans ... From 5.58 p.m. to 7 p.m. persons on Malyy Kamennyy bridge and Bolotnaya embankment made attempts to break the cordon, and threw empty glass bottles, fireworks, chunks of tarmac and portable metal barriers at the police officers. From 5 to 6 p.m. music was playing on the stage ... At 5.20 p.m. ... a deputy of the Vologda Regional Duma called on the participants to head to the Malyy Kamennyy bridge to support those sitting on the ground ... At 6 p.m. one of the organisers, Ms Mityushkina ..., went on the stage and declared the meeting closed. At 6.20 p.m. Mr Udaltsov went on the stage and called on the people to take part in an indefinite protest action.\\nAt 7 p.m. a group of about 20 individuals including Ms Mityushkina ... attempted to put up three one-sleeper camping tents on Bolotnaya embankment.\\n...\\nFrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. necessary measures were taken to push the citizens away from Malyy Kamennyy bridge, Bolotnaya embankment and Bolotnaya Street and to arrest the most actively resisting ones ..., during which twenty-eight police officers and military servicemen [sustained injuries] of various gravity, four of whom have been hospitalised.\\nIn total, 656 people were detained in Moscow to prevent public disorder and unauthorised demonstrations ...\\n...\\nThe total number of troops deployed for public order and security duties in Moscow was 12,759 servicemen, including 7,609 police officers, 100 traffic police officers, 4,650 military servicemen and 400 members of voluntary brigades.\\nAs a result of the measures taken by the Moscow Department of the Interior the tasks of maintaining public order and security have been fully discharged, and no emergency incidents have been allowed to occur.”', '44.  On the same day the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal investigation into suspected offences of mass disorder and violent acts against the police (Article 212 § 2 and Article 318 § 1 of the Criminal Code).', '45.  On 28 May 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising mass disorder (Article 212 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The two criminal cases were joined on the same day.', '46.  On 22 June 2012 the Investigative Committee set up a group of twenty-seven investigators and put them in charge of the criminal file concerning the events of 6 May 2012.', '47.  On an unspecified date two human-rights activists filed a request with the Investigative Committee to open a criminal investigation into the conduct of the police in the same events; they complained, in particular, of the suppression of a lawful public assembly. Another petition was filed, also on an unspecified date, by forty-four human-rights activists and members of NGOs, calling for the curbing of repression against those who had been arrested and prosecuted in relation to the events of 6 May 2012 and denying that mass riots had taken place at Bolotnaya Square.', '48.  Following an enquiry from the Investigative Committee about publication of the maps of the assembly of 6 May 2012, on 13 August 2012 the Moscow Department of the Interior replied as follows:\\n“... on 5 May 2012 the Moscow Department of the Interior published on its official website ... a notice on ‘Safeguarding public order in Moscow during the public events on 6 May’. The notice included information about the route, the map of traffic restrictions and information about the location of the socio-political events, which a large number of participants were expected to attend, the security measures and the warning against any unlawful acts during the events.\\nThe decision to publish this notice was taken by the head of the Department on Liaison with the Mass Media of the Moscow Department of the Interior with the aim of ensuring the security of citizens and media representatives planning to take part in the event.\\nThe pictures contained in the notice were schematic and showed the approximate route of the [march] as well as the reference place of the meeting – ‘Bolotnaya Square’ – indicated in the ‘Plan for Safeguarding Public Order in Moscow on 6 May 2012’.\\nOn 4 May 2012 a working meeting took place at the Moscow Department of Regional Security with participants from among [the organisers and the Department of the Interior], where they discussed the arrangements for the march ..., the placement of metal detectors, the stage set-up and other organisational matters.\\nAfter the meeting ... the [Moscow Department of the Interior] prepared a [security plan] and map providing for the park at Bolotnaya Square to be cordoned off with metal barriers [and] for the participants in the meeting to be accommodated on the road at the Bolotnaya embankment.\\nGiven that the agreement on the route of the demonstration and the meeting venue had been reached at the aforementioned working meeting at 9 p.m. on 4 May 2012, the [security plan] and the security maps were prepared at extremely short notice (during the night of 4 to 5 May 2012 and the day of 5 May 2012), to be approved afterwards, on 5 May 2012, by senior officials at the Moscow Department of the Interior.\\nThe Department of the Interior did not discuss the security maps and [security plan] with the organisers. Those documents were not published as they were for internal use, showing the placement of the police forces ... and setting out their tasks.”', '49.  On an unspecified date eight prominent international NGOs set up an international expert commission to evaluate the events at Bolotnaya Square on 6 May 2012 (“the Expert Commission”). The Expert Commission comprised six international experts whose objective was to provide an independent fact-finding and legal assessment of the circumstances in which the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square had been dispersed. In 2013 the Expert Commission produced a fifty-three-page report containing the chronology and an assessment of the events of May 6 2012. It identified the sources used for the report as follows:\\n“The work of the Commission was based on the following materials:\\n- evidence from the official investigation, reports and statements made by the relevant authorities and any other official information available on the case;\\n- information from public investigations and observations gathered by human rights defenders, journalists and others; and\\n- reports by observers and journalists, witness testimony and video materials.\\n...\\nIn order to provide an objective and complete picture of the events, the Commission developed a series of questions that it distributed to the city administration of Moscow, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, police authorities in Moscow, the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation and event organisers. Unfortunately the Commission did not receive replies from the city administration, police authorities or Investigative Committee. As a result, the analysis contained in this report is based on information from open sources, including materials presented by the event organisers, observers and non-governmental organisations, materials from public investigations and information provided by defence attorneys engaged in the so-called ‘Bolotnaya case’. These materials include: eyewitnesses’ testimony, videos from the media and private actors, documents and some open data about the Bolotnaya criminal case. The experts analysed more than 50 hours of video-records and 200 documents related to the Bolotnaya events. In addition, they met organisers, participants and observers of the events and attended several court hearings of the Bolotnaya case.”', '50.  Concerning the way the assembly of 6 May 2012 had been organised, the Expert Commission noted the following:\\n“... the Moscow Department of Regional Security announced on 4 May [2012] that the event would follow a similar route to the previous rally on 4 February [2012]. The participants were to assemble at Kaluzhskaya Square, set off at 4 p.m. along Bolshaya Yakimanka and Bolshaya Polyanka for a rally in Bolotnaya Square, and disperse at 7.30 p.m. The official notification of approval was issued on 4 May 2012 – just two days before the beginning of the event.\\nThat same day, the [Moscow Department of the Interior] published a plan on its website indicating that all of Bolotnaya Square, including the public gardens, would be given over to the rally, while the Bolshoy Kamenny bridge would be closed to vehicles but would remain open to pedestrians. This was the same procedure [the] authorities had adopted for the two previous rallies on Bolotnaya Square on 10 December 2011 and 4 February 2012.\\n...\\nOn the evening of [5 May 2012], the police cordoned off the [park] of Bolotnaya Square. According to Colonel Yuri Zdorenko, who was responsible for security at the location, this was done ‘in order to prevent the participants from setting up a camp and from [carrying out] other [illegal] acts.’ [The] authorities received information [that] the protesters might attempt to establish a protest camp at the site, causing them to decide that the rally should be confined to only the Bolotnaya waterfront area – a much smaller area than had been originally allocated for the assembly.\\n...\\nThe police did not, however, inform the organisers of the changes they had decided upon, and they only became aware of the police-imposed changes to the event when they arrived at the site on the afternoon of 6 May [2012].\\nThe City Council did not send out a written announcement that a special representative from the city authorities would be present at the event, nor did the chairman of the Moscow local department of the [Interior], Vladimir Kolokoltsev, issue any special orders on sending a special representative of the Ministry to the event.\\n...\\nThe organisers requested 12 hours to set up a stage and sound equipment for the rally; however, on the morning of 6 May, the authorities only allocated six hours of advance access. Furthermore, at 1.30 p.m., the police did not allow vehicles with stage equipment onto the site until they had been searched. The searches revealed a small number of tents, and [the] authorities detained a number of people as a result. The police finally allowed the truck with the stage equipment onto Bolotnaya Square at 2.50 p.m., just 70 minutes before the march was due to begin.”', '51.  As regards the circumstances in which the assembly was dispersed, the Expert Commission’s report stated as follows:\\n“As the march approached Bolotnaya Square, [the] demonstrators found that a police cordon was blocking off most of the square, leaving only a narrow stretch along the waterfront for the rally. The police established a triple cordon of officers on Bolshoy Kammenyy bridge, which prevented any movement in the direction of the Kremlin. The first cordon was positioned close to the junction of Malyy Kamennyy bridge and the Bolotnaya waterfront. Students from the Police College and officers of the Patrol Guard Service (without any protective equipment) made up this line. Behind them were two rows of OMON [riot police – OMOН], a line of voluntary citizen patrol (druzhinniki), and another cordon of the OMON [the riot police]. A number of water cannons were visible between the second and third cordons.\\n[The report contained two photographs comparing the police cordon on 4 February 2012, a thin line of police officers without protection gear, and the one on 6 May 2012, multiple ranks of riot police with full protection gear backed up by heavy vehicles.]\\nThe police cordons, which blocked off movement in the direction of the Kremlin, created a bottleneck that slowed the march’s progress to such an extent that it came to a virtual stop as demonstrators attempted to cross the bridge. Moreover, just beyond Luzhkov bridge, the marchers had to go through a second set of metal detectors, where progress was very slow since there were only 14 detectors.\\nBy 5.15 p.m., the majority of the march was immobile. A number of leaders, including Sergey Udaltsov, Alexey Navalnyy and Ilya Yashin, encouraged demonstrators to sit down on the road in front of the ‘Udarnik’ cinema facing the police cordon to protest [against] the inability of the march to continue and to demand that they be given access to the originally allocated space for the rally on Bolotnaya Square. An estimated 50-200 people joined the sit-down protest. The leaders stressed the need to maintain a peaceful protest and appealed to demonstrators to remain calm. Participants chanted: ‘We will not go away’ and ‘Police together with the people’. The leaders attempted to address the crowds using loudspeakers, but those behind the sit-down protest could not hear or see events as they transpired. The sit-down protest did not completely block the road, but it did restrict the movement of those approaching the police lines and the bottleneck caused by the police cordon. As a result, the crowd grew denser as more demonstrators arrived from Bolshaya Yakimanka Street.\\nAt 5.42 p.m., the chief of the [Moscow Department of the Interior] issued a statement: ‘The organizers of the rally and other participants refuse to proceed to the agreed place of the rally (to Bolotnaya Square). They [have] stopped on the roadway near the ‘Udarnik’ theatre. Some of them [have] sat on the ground and thus blocked the movement of the column. Despite repeated warnings on the part of the police to proceed to the place of the rally, they won’t move thereby creating a real threat of a jam and trauma for the participants. An inquiry commission is working on the spot to document their actions related to appeals to commit mass public disorder with a view to further consider the issue of instituting criminal proceedings.’\\nSome demonstrators appeared to become frustrated with standing and waiting and began to walk away. Some tried to pass through the police cordon to leave the area, but the police refused to let them through. Instead, they were directed to go back through the crowd to Bolshaya Polyanka Street, even though this was practically impossible.\\nThe police used loud speakers to inform demonstrators of the rally location. They asked participants to pass directly to Bolotnaya Square and not stop at the bridge, despite the fact that the major part of the square was closed to demonstrators. They announced that all actions on the bridge could be considered illegal. However, given the poor quality of the sound equipment, only those nearest the police could hear this information; the majority of protesters did not hear the police instructions.\\n...\\nFrom the moment difficulties first arose for demonstrators attempting to cross Malyy Kammenyy bridge, demonstrators made repeated attempts to negotiate with the police over moving their cordons to allow protesters onto Bolotnaya Square.\\nDmitry Oreshkin, a member of the Presidential Human Rights Council, and Member of Parliament Gennady Gudkov tried to talk to the police authorities at around 5.30 p.m., but there was no response. Shortly after participants broke through the police cordon at 6.20 p.m., a group of human rights activists spoke to Colonel Birukov, head of the [Moscow Department of the Interior]’s press service. At 7 p.m., Member of Parliament Ilya Ponomarev tried to stop violence during the clashes on the embankment by speaking to the authorities, but he did not get a positive response.\\nMany of those involved in organising the event stated that they tried to engage with [the] police throughout the day to ensure the event took place in a peaceful manner.\\nNadezhda Mityushkina: ‘I tried unsuccessfully to find the responsible people in the Ministry of the [Interior] in order to solve the organisational problems. I knew whom to contact in case we needed help when issues arose ... Only at 6 – 6.30 p.m. did a police officer approach me. I knew from previous demonstrations that he was a senior officer responsible for communication with event organisers ... and he told me that the authorities had suspended the demonstration. He told me, as one of the rally organizers, to announce from the stage that the event was over, which I did following our conversation.’\\nIgor Bakirov: ‘A police officer in a colonel’s uniform contacted me only once, and I showed him the documents [confirming] my credentials as an event organiser. Later clashes with the police erupted, I couldn’t find anyone with whom to communicate and cooperate.’\\nSergey Davidis: ‘I personally did not meet nor have time to get into contact with the authorities regarding the fences set up around the perimeter of the rally. I assumed some other organisers had already spoken to the authorities regarding this issue or were speaking with them at that time. There was no one to contact and nothing to talk about. I only saw the OMON officers who behaved aggressively and were not predisposed to get into a conversation.\\n...’\\nAt 5.55 p.m., as people tried to move through the narrow gap between the police cordon and the waterfront to reach Bolotnaya Square, the police line moved two steps forward, further pressing the crowd. This in turn generated a counter response from the crowd, and protesters began pushing back. In several places, the police cordon broke, and a few dozen people found themselves in the empty space behind the first police line. It is impossible to determine whether the breaking of the cordon was the result of conscious action by sections of the crowd or if the police cordon simply broke due to the pressure from such a large number of people. Some of those who made it past the police lines were young men, but there were also many elderly citizens and others who did not resemble street fighters. Those who found themselves behind the police cordon did not act in an aggressive manner but appeared to move towards the entrance to the Bolotnaya [park], the supposed rally point.\\nDifferent demonstrators reacted very differently to the breaking of the police line. Some tried to move away, others called for people to break the cordon, while some tried to restrain the crowd from [trampling on] those who were still taking part in the sit-down protest. As pressure and tension grew, the sit-down protesters stood up rather than risk being trampled. There was a high degree of confusion, and people were not clear on what was happening.\\nJust after the breaking of the police cordon at approximately at 6 p.m., a single Molotov cocktail was thrown from the crowd. It landed behind the police ranks and ignited the trousers of ... a 74-year-old demonstrator who had passed through the cordon. The police used their fire extinguishers to put out the fire. This was the only such incident recorded during the day ...\\n...\\nSoon after the cordons were broken, the authorities began to detain those who remained behind the police lines, taking them to special holding areas. The police also arrested some protesters at the front of the crowd who had not tried to break the cordon. The police cordon was fully restored after about four minutes.\\n...\\nAt 6.10 p.m., Sergey Udaltsov, Alexey Navalnyy and Boris Nemtsov managed to walk from the Udarnik cinema to the stage at the waterfront followed by a large number of people. A police cordon blocked access to the stage, but they were allowed through. As they tried to start the rally, the police intervened ... the OMON officers then detained Sergey Udaltsov on stage and shortly afterwards detained Boris Nemtsov and Alexey Navalnyy as well. By 6.50 p.m. the organizers began to disassemble the stage.\\n...\\nIn the two hours between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., the demonstration was marked by two distinct types of activity. For much of the time, demonstrators and the police stood face to face without much happening. These moments were interspersed with periods when the police advanced and the crowd moved back. There does not appear to have been any clear reason for the police decision to advance other than to divide the crowd up into smaller sections. More than anything, the police advances served to raise tensions and provoke some members of the crowd to push back. There is little evidence that demonstrators initiated the violence. Rather, they appear to have become aggressive only in response to the authorities’ advances.\\nDuring these interchanges some protesters threw objects at the police, and the police used their batons freely. The crowd threw plastic bottles, shoes and umbrellas ...\\nAt around 6.20 p.m. the police announced that the rally was cancelled and asked protesters to disperse. The police used a loudspeaker to state, ‘Dear citizens, we earnestly ask you not to disturb public order! Otherwise, in accordance with the law, we will have to use force! Please, leave here, and do not stop. Go to the metro.’ Although the police used a loudspeaker, the announcement was not loud enough to reach the majority of the crowd. It is likely that only those nearest to the loudspeakers could have heard the call to disperse.\\nThere was confusion over the police demands because at the same time ... Colonel Birukov, head of the Moscow [Department of the Interior]’s press service, told a group of human rights defenders (including Vladimir Lukin, Dmitri Oreshkin, Victor Davydov and Nikolai Svanidze) that the demonstrators could continue to Bolotnaya Square to take part in the rally.\\n...\\nBy 6.30 p.m. the crowd at the corner of Malyy Kamennyy bridge and the waterfront was cut in two. Those on Malyy Kamennyy bridge were pushed in the direction of Bolshaya Polyanka Street, while those on the waterfront were cut off from both Bolshoy and Malyy Kamennyy bridges.\\nAround 6.54 p.m., the police cordon that acted as a barrier along the waterfront near the Luzhkov bridge was removed, and demonstrators were able to move freely along the Bolotnaya waterfront. Approximately 15 minutes later, some 200 police officers in protective equipment who had formed a cordon at the Luzhkov Bridge began pushing protesters in the direction of Lavrushinsky Lane, which runs from Bolotnaya Square to the Tretyakovskaya metro station. At the same time, police began to push people back along the Bolotnaya waterfront from the Luzhkov bridge towards the Udarnik cinema. Those who remained on the waterfront linked arms in passive resistance. The police pushed forward, divided the crowd and began to detain demonstrators.\\nAt about 7.47 p.m. ... authorities created a corridor to allow demonstrators to leave the Bolotnaya area.\\n...\\nAt 7.53 p.m. a group of OMON officers appeared from the bushes of Bolotnaya Gardens and divided those demonstrators that remained on the square. Those on one side were able to move towards Malyy Kamennyy bridge, while those on the other remain[ed] totally blocked between the police lines.\\nAt 8.08 p.m. the last groups of people slowly left the waterfront along a corridor formed by the policemen. The police also began to move people away from the Kadashevskaya waterfront on the other side of the Obvondoy Channel. Some people were detained, while others were pushed along Bolshaya Polyanka Street in the direction of the Lavrushinsky Lane.\\nBetween 9 and 10 p.m. around two thousand demonstrators moved along Bolshaya Ordynka Street chanting slogans ... and the OMON officers began to detain people and actively disperse the column.”', '52.  On 20 March 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy branch of the Investigative Committee dismissed ten individual complaints and two official enquiries made in relation to the matter, one by Mr Ponomarev, a deputy of the State Duma, and another one by Mr A. Babushkin, President of the Public Supervisory Committee of Moscow. The complaints and enquiries concerned the allegedly unlawful acts of the police in dispersing the rally on 6 May 2012, including excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests. The Investigative Committee interviewed one of the ten individuals who had lodged the complaints and four police officers deployed in the cordon around Bolotnaya Square, including squadron and regiment commanders. They stated, in particular, that they had been acting under orders to maintain public safety and to identify and arrest the most active instigators of unrest; only those resisting the demands of the police had been arrested and no force had been used unnecessarily. The police officers stated that when the police had had to intervene, they had used combat manoeuvres and truncheons but not tear gas or other exceptional means of restraint. Squadron Commander S. explained that he had been deployed in the sector adjacent to the stage and that there had been no incidents or disorder in that sector; no one had been arrested. The decision listed thirteen other internal inquiries carried out following individual complaints and medical reports; in six cases the allegations of abuse had been found to be unsubstantiated and in seven cases the police conduct had been found to be lawful. As regards the substance of the complaints at hand, the Investigative Committee found as follows:\\n“... having crossed Malyy Kamennyy bridge, the column leaders stopped. Many participants in the march bypassed the organisers and proceeded to Bolotnaya Square towards the stage ... When the march participants had filled nearly all of Bolotnaya embankment, limited by the police cordon on one side and by the stage on the other side, the organisers were still at the point between Malyy Kamennyy bridge, Bolotnaya Square, [the park] and the Udarnik cinema ...\\nAt this time the organisers demanded that the police officers let them pass through to the Kremlin. The police told them that they would not let anyone pass through to the Kremlin because the event was authorised to take place at Bolotnaya Square, where the stage had been specially set up, and they were told to proceed. After that, the organisers decided to call a sit-down protest and called upon those present to disobey the lawful orders of the police. After that, the meeting participants congregated opposite the Udarnik cinema, where after a while they attempted to break the cordon, which [the police] did not manage to prevent. Therefore the police began arresting those who had been most actively involved in breaking the cordon; they were put in a police van and then taken to police stations in Moscow. After the confrontation had been localised, the police officers slightly dispersed the crowd, having apprehended the most active perpetrators. From the very beginning of the sit-down protest the police requested the participants through loudspeakers to proceed to the stage, not to act on provocation and not to commit unlawful acts, but these requests had no effect and therefore [it was clear that] the breaking of the cordon had been organised. In suppressing it the police officers acted in coordination and concert. They did not apply force or special means of restraint. However, the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve the use of force and special means of restraint, in so far as necessary, against persons putting up resistance.\\nLater on, in the area of Malyy Kamennyy bridge and at the [park] corner some localised confrontations took place ... force and special means of restraint were used. All those detained at Bolotnaya Square were taken to the police stations ... Administrative offence reports were then submitted to the Justices of the Peace for consideration on the merits.\\n...\\nIn accordance with Article 42 of the Criminal Code, any acts of a public official connected with the use of his or her official powers which have caused damage to interests protected by law may not be classified as a criminal offence if they were committed pursuant to a binding order or instruction.\\n...\\nAfter the organisers had decided to call a sit-down protest ... [they] provoked mass disorder, during which the participants threw various objects at the police, thus causing injuries to some of them. Because of this turn of events the police officers detained those participating in the mass disorder with justifiable use of force, and by special means of restraint against those who resisted.\\n...\\nIn view of the foregoing, the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers ... is refused for the absence of corpus delicti.”', '53.  On 24 May 2013 the first criminal case against twelve individuals suspected of participation in mass disorder was transferred to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow for the determination of criminal charges (“the first Bolotnaya case”).', '54.  On 2 December 2013 Mr Navalnyy gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. He testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“The political organisers and the formal organisers, we all had a clear idea ... and the Moscow mayor’s office confirmed that the march would be the same as the one that had taken place on 4 February 2012. Bolotnaya Square is a traditional place for holding various opposition events. We all had a clear understanding what the route would be, where the stage would be, what the layout would be. We came there at that time for a rather traditional, customary event, the scenario of which was well-known to everybody ... two days beforehand the maps showing where people would assemble and the direction of the march were published on the official [news] website RiaNovosti; they are still posted there. The map was published on the [police] website ‘Petrovka, 38’ and this map is still posted there. Not only the organisers, but the participants too, they knew where they were going ... When we approached the venue of the meeting ... we saw that the map showing where people would assemble on the square had been essentially altered. It was essentially different from the map of 4 February [2012], and, above all, different from the document which had been agreed with the Moscow mayor’s office and had been published on the website[s] RiaNovosti and ‘Petrovka, 38’ ... [according to which] people were to assemble on Bolotnaya embankment as well as in the park at Bolotnaya Square. However, when we came we saw that the park at Bolotnaya Square, taking up about 80% of the square, was barred and cordoned off ... since [the cordon] did not correspond [to the map] the column stopped. The event organisers and the people who came just waited for this question to be resolved, for the police to remove the wrong cordon, for the police chiefs to reply as to what had changed, why the approved meeting was not being conducted according to the scenario that had been approved ... I had previously [organised events] ... Somebody had taken the map and changed the location of the meeting. This had practically never happened before ... to show visually that we were not moving anywhere, we sat on the ground ... the first line of [the police] cordon was composed of 20-year-old conscripts, and with a thousand people pressing on it the cordon broke. It could only break. This led to an uncontrollable situation, as several policemen were walking and trying to say something through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. Some activists passing by were also speaking through megaphones – impossible to tell what they were saying. No authorities were present on the spot. And [it was] impossible to understand who was in command. So all of that caused the rupture of the police cordon. People started spreading across that spot ...Then I tried to walk over to the stage to try and explain to the gathering what was going on, using the amplifiers. I did not know then that the police had already cut off the amplifiers.\\n[Question to the witness] Did anybody try to negotiate with the participants of the sit-down protest?\\n- Attempts had been made as much as possible in the circumstances ... everybody had stopped because we all wanted to understand where the representatives from the mayor’s office were, where the appropriate representative of the Department of the Interior was. All the [high-ranking] police officers were asked, but they only shrugged. Nobody could understand what was going on. The State Duma deputies present on the spot tried to act as negotiators, but ... they said that nobody wanted to come up to us. We could see some police officers resembling chiefs, at a distance ... but it was impossible to get to them ... it was impossible to reach the [police] command. Nobody would come to us. Nobody could negotiate despite everyone’s wish to do so.\\n... when I was in the detention facility I lodged a complaint about the hindrance of a peaceful public event. This complaint was with the Moscow Department of the Interior. I have set out the arguments [as to why] I considered that there had been ample evidence that the officials of the Moscow Department of the Interior had deliberately provoked the crowd to panic so that [they] could later make claims about mass disorder.”', '55.  On the same day Mr Davidis gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. He testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“The negotiations with the [mayor’s office] were very difficult this time ... I had been the organiser of most events from 25 December 2011. It was always possible to meet the deadline, to find a compromise, [but not this time]. ... It was [only] on 4 [May 2012] that we received the written agreement. On the same day the working meeting took place ... Usually, everything is decided no later than five days before the event. This time there was practically twenty-four hours’ notice. We could not even bring the vehicles carrying the stage to the square before 1 p.m. [on 6 May 2012]. We were put under very harsh conditions ... we had to put up the stage within three hours ... At the [working meeting] technical issues were discussed, but for the previous events we held, as a matter of practice, [there was] an on-site reconnaissance: the representatives of the organisers [together with] the representatives of the police ... would visit the site, walk through the route and determine where the barriers would be put, the stage, the lavatories, so that there was no ambiguity in understanding the event. This time, because [the working meeting] was on 4 [May 2012], and the event was on 6 [May 2012], it was already clear at the working meeting that we wouldn’t have time for an on-site reconnaissance; therefore at Mr Deynichenko’s suggestion it was stated that in organising the event we would follow the example of the assembly held on 4 February [2012]. Then, it was also a march from Kaluzhskaya Square and a meeting at Bolotnaya Square. The only thing that was noted was that this time the stage would be a bit closer to the park at Bolotnaya Square, at the corner of the square, because originally the event had been declared for 5,000 participants. We had a feeling that people were disappointed, somehow low-spirited, and that not many would come. When we realised that there would be more people I told that to Mr Oleynik [the First Deputy Director of the Regional Security Department], but he told us that it was unacceptable. But it was clear that we could not do anything about it. We warned that there would be significantly more participants ... When we called Mr Deynichenko the following day he told [us] that he had had a map drawn up by the Department of the Interior, and that Mr Udaltsov could come during the day to see it to clarify any issues. During the day he postponed the meeting several times and then he was no longer picking up the phone. Therefore it was not possible to see or discuss the map.\\n[Question to the witness] Was the blocking of the park discussed at the working meeting, or later?\\n- No, of course not. The event of 4 February [2012] had been organised so that the meeting was held at Bolotnaya Square. Bolotnaya Square is an area comprising the park and Bolotnaya embankment. It was supposed that people would ... turn [like before] towards the park. It was said that everything except the position of the stage, which would be moved forwards 20 metres, would be the same as [the last] time, this was expressly spelled out. We were guided by it.\\n[Question to the witness] With whom was it discussed that the positioning of the security forces would be the same, [give us] the names?\\n- This was spelled out at the big working meeting at the office of Mr Oleynik and in his presence. Since we realised that we had no time for an on-the-spot reconnaissance, Mr Deynichenko suggested that it would be like the last time as we had already walked along this route.\\n...\\n... Nadezhda Mityushkina called me several times and complained that they were having trouble bringing in the equipment ... that they could not find anyone in charge. Usually it is the police representative who is responsible for the event, separately for the march and for the meeting. When I crossed [to] the area allocated to the march, even before passing through the metal detectors, Colonel Makhonin, who is traditionally in charge of the march, called me. We met. I gave him a written undertaking not to breach the law ... I told him that [two members of staff] had been arrested [at the stage area] ... he promised to release them ...\\n[Question to the witness] What exactly did Colonel Makhonin say? The areas allocated to the march and to the meeting, were they determined in front of the camera?\\n- No we did not discuss it ...\\n... at the turning [from Malyy Kamenny bridge] the procession came to a standstill ... some people sat on the ground ... those who sat down had justifiably asked for an expansion. I could not push through to get there. I learned that both [State Duma deputies] were conducting negotiations; I thought that it was probably going to settle this situation ... at a certain point Ms Mityushkina called me and said that the police were demanding to close the event. I explained ... that if [the police] considered that there had been breaches, they had to give us time to remedy these defects, they could not end the event at once. I called Mr Udaltsov ... and said that we were coming, [that there was] no need to end anything. Actually when I reached the corner the sit-in protest had already ended. The organisers who had participated in the sit-in protest and [other] people tried to approach the stage ...\\n...\\nThe official website of the Moscow [Department of the] Interior published the map on which it was shown, just as agreed [and] just as on 4 February 2012, [that] the border [of the meeting venue] was outlined at the far end of the park and not the near one ... all agreements were breached.\\n[Question to the witness] During the working meeting on 4 [May 2012] or at the beginning of the [march], did the Department of the Interior warn you about any preparations for provocations, breach of public order, the campsite?\\n- No, there were no such talks with the police.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] If one has a badge, does it help in principle for talking to the police?\\n- No, it does not make any difference. I personally called Mr Deynichenko and asked him to take measures. There was no communication with the police. The police officers did not pick up the phone calls. [I] did not manage to find anyone in charge of the police.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] When, according to the rules, ... should the appointments be made to coordinate ... on the part of the organisers and the mayor’s office?\\n- The law does not expressly say [when] ... we received no documents from the [Moscow Government] or the Department of the Interior. We had no information as to who was responsible.\\n[Question to the witness] That means that at the beginning and during the event you did not know the names of those in charge?\\n- Except for the officer in charge of the march, Colonel Makhonin.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] When the emergency occurred, who did you try calling at the Department of the Interior command ...?\\n- By then I was no longer trying to call anyone. I had heard that [the two State Duma deputies] were holding negotiations. I called Mr Udaltsov to tell him that they were trying to close the meeting, but he told me that they were already heading to the stage, that they had ended the sit-in protest.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] Why did the police announce that the event was banned?\\n- I cannot explain why such a decision was taken. They themselves impeded the conduct of the event and then they ended it by themselves ...\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] The reason why [the event was] closed was the sit-down protest?\\n- As I understood from Ms Mityushkina, yes.\\n[Question to the witness] How did the police make their demands? Through loudspeakers?\\n- I would not say that it was some sort of large-scale [announcement]. It was more through physical force. But some demands were made via megaphones, there were no other means.”', '56.  On 5 December 2013 Mr Nemtsov gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. He testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“... I was not one of the organisers of the event, but I was well informed about the way it had been authorised. On the website of the Moscow Department of the Interior a map was posted showing the location of the police [cordon] and the access points. The map was in the public domain and one could see that the park of Bolotnaya Square should have been opened. But it turned out to be closed. Moreover, we openly announced on the Internet, and it was reported in the media, that the route would be exactly the same as on 4 February 2012 ... On 4 February 2012 there was an authorised event ... all of [Bolotnaya] Square was open, no cordons on Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge. We easily turned into the square, there had been no scuffles ... we were sure that on 6 May 2012 it would be exactly the same picture ... but the police had deceived us, blocked Bolotnaya Square, having left a very narrow passage for the demonstrators. We understood that it would be hard to pass through this bottleneck. We stopped, and to show the police that we were not going to storm the Kremlin and the [Bolshoy] Kamennyy bridge we sat on the ground ... Mr Gudkov [the State Duma deputy], ... offered to be an intermediary in the negotiations between the protesters and the police ... we waited, all was peaceful ... he several times attempted to negotiate but this came to nothing. It became clear that ... the crowd were about to panic. We got up. And an awful scuffle began ... I was moving [to the stage] ... when I arrived there I saw a strange scene for an authorised event. The microphones had all been switched off, Mr Navalnyy and Mr Udaltsov had been arrested just before me. The police never act like that at authorised events. I took a megaphone and addressed the people. I did not speak for long. Within a few minutes the police apprehended me. ...\\n[Question to the witness] Why, as you say, were the police particularly aggressive?\\n- The demonstration took place just one day before Mr Putin’s inauguration. Naturally, the police had received very strict orders. Naturally, they were paranoid about ‘Maidan’. The fact that they had treacherously breached the agreement and closed off the square, this proves that there were political orders. I was particularly surprised at Mr Gorbenko, the deputy mayor, with whom Mr Gudkov was negotiating. He is a reasonable man, but here he was like a zombie, he would not negotiate with Mr Gudkov. This was strange ... he did not want to talk like a human. ...\\n[Question to the witness] Did you know about the intention to set up tents, or about the breaking of the cordon?\\n- No, I did not know about it then.\\n...\\nWe demanded only that [the authorities] implement what had been agreed with [the organisers].”', '57.  On 18 December 2013 Ms Mirza, the head of the Ombudsman’s secretariat, gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. She testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“... [on 6 May 2012] I was present as an observer ... unlike the usual events held at Bolotnaya Square, [this time] the park was cordoned off ... when we passed the metal detectors ... Mr Biryukov called and asked us to return urgently because ... at Malyy Kamennyy bridge ... [protesters] had sat down on the ground ... [The Ombudsman] tried to persuade these people to stand up and to go and conduct the meeting ... At this time the [second] riot police cordon, which had stood between Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge and Malyy Kamenny bridge, apparently approached the crowd, therefore the pressure built up from both sides ... I tried to leave the congested area ... showed my observer’s badge ... but the riot police were not listening to me, laughed slightly and continued to press, there was no reaction on their part. This somewhat surprised me because we found ourselves there at the request of the Moscow Department of the Interior.\\n...\\nUsually there was no such multi-layered defence. Bolshoy Kamenny bridge was blocked as if it was warfare, beyond what was required, as we thought ... among the protesters we saw several people in masks, and we reported that to the police, [as] this was unusual. The mood of the Department of the Interior was also unusual, and so was the mood of the riot police. A police chief from the Moscow Department of the Interior, Mr Biryukov, told me, for example, that he could do nothing, that he was not in charge of the riot police and that the riot police reported to the [federal] police, and this was also unusual to us. I spoke to the deputy mayor ... and saw how upset he was, and his very presence there was also [a rare occasion].\\n...\\nAs I was later told by Mr Biryukov from the Department of the Interior, [the protesters had sat down on the ground] because the passage had been narrowed down. The passage had indeed been narrowed down, I can confirm that, I saw that, the passage was much narrower than usual, and there were metal detectors which were not supposed to be there.\\n...\\nMr Biryukov was in charge on behalf of the Moscow Department of the Interior – this is absolutely certain because he is always in charge of such events. His name, his function and his telephone number were written on our badges so that he could be contacted if any questions or doubts arose. As to the [representative of the mayor’s office], [I am not sure].\\n[Question to the witness] You have explained about the cordon. Why was it not possible, for example, to move it [back] so as to prevent a scuffle?\\n- Mr Biryukov is a very constructive person and he knows his job, but he could not explain to me why he could not influence the riot police.\\n... [the deputy mayor also] told me that he could not do anything, it was said to me personally. At this time the breaking of the cordon occurred. [The Ombudsman] and our staff, together with a few other people, walked out through [the gap] ...\\n[Question to the witness] Did you receive any information while at the cordon? Perhaps you heard from the police officers about the official closure of the public event?\\n- No.\\n... After the cordon had already been broken, when the arrests had begun, [then] they were telling us through a megaphone to disperse, that the meeting was over, I heard it.”', '58.  On 23 December 2013 Mr N. Svanidze, a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. He testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“... [on 6 May 2012] I was present as an observer ... [when] everybody headed towards the narrow bottleneck at the embankment ... it created a jam. Several dozen people sat on the ground, and the cordon moved towards them ... I asked ‘Why won’t they open up the passage?’, but Viktor Aleksandrovich [Biryukov] would turn his face away and would not answer when told that the passage had to be opened. I understood that there was no point talking to him, he was not in command.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] Did [the Ombudsman] or anyone else attempt to negotiate the widening of the passage?\\n- We could not do anything. We requested it, [Ms Mirza] requested it and I think that [the Ombudsman] did too, but nothing was done. The passage was not widened.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] Were there any calls to move towards the Kremlin?\\n- No.\\n...\\n[Question to the witness] During your presence at the event did you know on what territory the meeting had been authorised?\\n- Yes, I was convinced that [it was] Bolotnaya Square and the park at Bolotnaya Square.”', '59.  On the same day Mr Vasiliev, a staff member at the Ombudsman’s office, gave testimony as a witness in the first Bolotnaya case. He testified, in particular, as follows:\\n“... [on 6 May 2012] I was present as an observer ... on that day we gathered at the press centre of the Department of the Interior, we were given maps, instructions on how to behave, the list of public observers ...\\n... the Ombudsman asked [the protesters sitting on the ground] why they were not going to the meeting venue. I could not hear the answer, they got up and headed on, after that, congestion occurred ... [the Ombudsman] began looking for the officer responsible for the cordon. There was [the chief press officer] Mr Biryukov there, [the Ombudsman] told him: ‘let’s move the cordon back so that people can pass’ [but] Mr Biryukov told him that it was outside his powers. [The Ombudsman] asked in whose powers it was; he replied ‘I don’t know’. At that moment the police began splitting the crowd ...”', '60.  On 21 February 2014 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow delivered a judgment in the first Bolotnaya case. It found eight individuals guilty of participation in mass disorder and of violent acts against police officers during the public assembly on 6 May 2012. They received prison sentences of between two and a half and four years; one of them was released on parole. Three co-defendants had previously been pardoned under the Amnesty Act and a fourth had his case disjoined from the main proceedings.', '61.  On 22 May 2014 the Zamoskvoretskiy branch of the Investigative Committee dismissed five complaints by individuals who had sustained injuries on 6 May 2012, allegedly through the excessive use of force by the police. The complaints had originally been a part of the criminal investigation file concerning the mass disorder, but were subsequently disjoined from it. During the investigation of the mass disorder case, confrontations were conducted between those who had lodged complaints (in the capacity of the accused in the criminal case) and the police officers accused of violence (in the capacity of victims in the criminal case). The relevant part of the decision read as follows:\\n“In suppressing attempts to break the police cordon, the police officers acted in coordination and concert, without applying physical force or special means of restraint; however, the work of the officers charged with apprehending offenders did involve physical force and special means of restraint, in so far as necessary [to restrain] those resisting.\\nAfter the crowd of protesters had calmed down and thinned out a little, the police officers began to tighten the cordon, [and] by doing so encouraged the citizens to proceed to the stage. At the same time many participants in the meeting who did not want to go there began to return to Bolshaya Yakimanka Street in Moscow. The police also accompanied them.\\nLater, in the area of Malyy Kamennyy bridge and at the corner of the park [at Bolotnaya Square] confrontations took place between the provocateurs, the persons calling for defiance and the persons displaying such defiance. During the apprehension of those persons force was used by the police because of their resistance, and in a number of cases, special means of restraint were also used for apprehending the most active instigators.\\n...\\nBecause of such a turn of events the police officers justifiably used physical force to apprehend the participants in the mass disorder, and also special means of restraint in relation to some of them who attempted to resist.”', '62.  On 20 June 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 21 February 2014, having slightly reduced the prison sentences for two of the defendants.', '63.  On 24 July 2014 the Moscow City Court found Mr Udaltsov and Mr Razvozzhayev guilty of organising mass disorder on 6 May 2012. The judgment contained the following findings:\\n“The witness Mr Deynichenko testified that on 4 May 2012 he had taken part in a working meeting at the Moscow Department of Regional Security... as a follow-up to the meeting a draft security plan was prepared, and all necessary agreements were reached with the organisers concerning the order of the march and meeting, the movement of the column, the stage set-up, access to the meeting venue, barriers and the exit from the stage; the [organisers] had agreed on that. The question of using the park at Bolotnaya Square was not raised because the declared number of participants was 5,000, whereas over 20,000 people could be accommodated in the open area of the square and the embankment, and [the organisers] had known that in advance. It had been discussed with them how the cordon would be placed from Malyy Kamennyy bridge to the park of Bolotnaya Square, so the organisers knew about the cordon in advance. The placement of the cordon was indicated in the [security plan]. This document was for internal use and access to it was only given to the police; the location of the forces could be changed in an emergency by the operational headquarters. The organisers did not insist on an on-the-spot visit; such visits are held at the initiative of the organisers, which had not been requested because they had known the route ... and the meeting venue ... [The witness Mr Deynichenko] had known that at the beginning of the march the event organisers, including Mr Udaltsov, had discussed between them that they were not going to turn towards the meeting venue but would stop and try to break the cordon to proceed to Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge.\\n...\\nThe witness N. Sharapov testified that Mr Udaltsov had known the route of the march and had not raised a question about opening up the park at Bolotnaya Square. Moreover, the park was a nature reserve with narrow lanes ... the park had been opened up previously [for a public event], as an exception, on only one occasion, on 4 February 2012, but then it was winter, it was snowing and the declared number of participants had significantly exceeded 5,000. No such exception was made for 6 May 2012.\\n... according to the statement of the Moscow City Security Department, ...the meeting venue at Bolotnaya embankment could accommodate 26,660 people ...\\nThe fact that no map of the assembly route or the placement of the police had been produced at the working meeting of 4 May 2012, that these questions had not been expressly discussed, ... that the event organisers present at the working meeting had not been shown any maps, was confirmed by them.\\n... the court concludes that no official map had been adopted with the organisers and, in the court’s opinion, [the published map] had been based on Mr Udaltsov’s own interview with journalists ...\\nTherefore the map presented by the defence has no official character, its provenance is unknown and therefore unreliable and it does not reflect the true route of the demonstration and the placement of the police forces.\\n... the witness Mr Makhonin ... testified that on 5 May 2012 he received the [security plan] ... Before the start of the march he personally met the event organisers Ms Mityushkina, Mr Udaltsov [and] Mr Davidis and in the presence of the press and with the use of video recordings explained to them the order of the meeting and the march, warned against the breach of public order during the conduct of the event; and stressed the need to inform him personally about any possible provocations by calling the telephone number known to the organisers. He asked Mr Udaltsov about the intention to proceed towards the Kremlin and to cause mass disorder because the police had received information about it from undercover sources; Mr Udaltsov had assured him that there would be no breaches of order at the event and that they had no intention to move towards the Kremlin ... He (Mr Makhonin) arrived at Bolotnaya Square after the mass disorder had already begun ... After the mass disorder began he tried calling Mr Udaltsov on the phone but there was no reply. Mr Udaltsov did not call him ... Other event organisers had not asked him to move the cordon. Given the circumstances, Ms Mityushkina, at his request, announced the end of the meeting, and the police opened additional exits for those willing to leave. In addition to that, the police repeated through a loudspeaker the announcement about the end of the meeting ...\\n... the witness Mr Zdorenko ...testified that ... following information received [from undercover sources] about the possible setting up of a camp site, at about 9 p.m. on 5 May 2012 he arrived at Bolotnaya Square and organised a search of the area including the park. The park was cordoned off and guarded ... if necessary, at the decision of the operational headquarters, the venue allocated for the meeting could be significantly extended at the expense of the park [at Bolotnaya Square]. However, there was no need for that given that there were no more than 2,500-3,000 persons on Bolotnaya Square ... [others being stopped at] Malyy Kamennyy bridge.\\n...\\nThe witness A. Zharkov testified that ...while the stage was being set up he had seen an unknown man smuggling four camping tents in rubbish bins.\\n...\\nThe witness M. Volondina testified that ... before the beginning of the march, police information came through from undercover sources that the event organisers intended to encircle the Kremlin holding hands to prevent the inauguration of the Russian President.\\nThe witness M. Zubarev testified that ... he had been [officially] filming ... while Police Officer Makhonin ... explained the order ... and warned the organisers ... and asked Mr Udaltsov to inform him of any possible provocations. Mr Udaltsov stated that they would act lawfully and that he had requested the police to stop any unwanted persons from joining the public event ...\\nThe witness Y. Vanyukhin testified that on 6 May 2012 ... at about 6 p.m. Mr Udaltsov, while on the way to the stage, told people around him that they were going to set up a campsite ...\\n... the witness Ms Mirza testified that ... Police Officer Biryukov had asked her and [the Ombudsman] to come to Malyy Kamennyy bridge where some of the protesters, including Mr Nemtsov and Mr Udaltsov, had not turned right towards the stage but had gone straight to the cordon, where they had begun a sit-in protest on the pretext that access to the park of Bolotnaya Square had been closed and cordoned off ... While [the Ombudsman] was talking to those sitting on the ground they remained silent and did not reply but would not stand up.\\nThe witness Mr Babushkin testified that ... after the first confrontations between the protesters and the police had begun, the latter announced through a loudspeaker that the meeting was cancelled and invited the citizens to leave.\\nThe witness Mr Ponomarev testified that ... the police cordon had been placed differently from [the cordon placed for] a similar march on 4 February 2012 ... he proposed to Mr Udaltsov that the cordon be pushed back so that the police would go back a few steps and widen access to Bolotnaya Square, and the latter replied that he would figure it out when they reached the cordon ... he knew that Mr G. Gudkov was negotiating with the police about moving the cordon, which had now been reinforced by the riot police.\\n... the witnesses Mr Yashin and Mr Nemtsov testified that ... during the steering committee meeting the question of setting up tents during the public event had not been discussed ... while [Mr G. Gudkov] and [Mr D. Gudkov] were negotiating with the police ... the crowd built up [and] suddenly the police began moving forward, the protesters resisted and the cordon broke ...\\nThe witness Mr G. Gudkov [deputy of the State Duma] testified that ... at the request of the organisers, who had told him that they would not go anywhere and would remain sitting until the police moved the cordon back and opened up access to the park at Bolotnaya Square, he had taken part in the negotiations with the police on that matter. He had reached an agreement with the officers of the Moscow Department of the Interior that the cordon would be moved back, but the organisers who had filed the notice [of the event] should have signed the necessary documents. However, those who had called for a sit-in, including Mr Udaltsov, refused [to stand up] to go to the offices of the Moscow Department of the Interior to sign the necessary documents, although he (Mr Gudkov) had proposed several times that they should do so ...\\n... the witness Mr D. Gudkov [deputy of the State Duma] testified that ... together with Mr G. Gudkov he had conducted negotiations with the police ... an agreement had been reached that the cordon at the Malyy Kamennyy bridge would be moved back and the access to the park would be opened up, but at that point some young men in hoodies among the protesters began first to push the citizens onto the cordon provoking the [same] response, after that the cordon was broken, the [police] began the arrests and mass disorder ensued.\\n...\\n... the court [rejects] the testimonies to the effect that it was the police who had begun moving towards the protesters who were peacefully sitting on the ground and thus provoked the breaking of the cordon ... [and finds ] that it was the protesters, and not the police ... who began pushing against the cordon, causing the crowd to panic, which eventually led to the breaking of the cordon and the ensuing mass disorder.\\n...\\nThe court takes into account the testimony of Mr Davidis that ... at about 6 p.m. Ms Mityushkina, who was responsible for the stage, informed him about the demand of the police that she announce, as an event organiser, that it was terminated. He passed this information on to Mr Udaltsov by phone, [and he] replied that they were standing up and heading towards the stage ... he knew that on 6 May 2012 [some] citizens had brought several tents to Bolotnaya Square, but Mr Udaltsov had not informed him about the need to put up tents during the public event.\\n...\\nThe court takes into account the testimony of Mr Bakirov ..., one of the [formal] event organisers ..., that nobody had informed him about the need to put up tents during the public event.\\n...\\n[The court examined] the video recording ... of the conversation between Mr Makhonin and Mr Udaltsov during which the latter assured Mr Makhonin that they would conduct the event in accordance with the authorisation, he would not call on people to stay in Bolotnaya Square and if problems occurred he would maintain contact with the police.\\n...\\n... [the court examined another video recording] in which Mr Makhonin and Mr Udaltsov discussed the arrangements. Mr Makhonin showed Mr Udaltsov where the metal detectors would be placed; after that they agreed to meet at 3 p.m. ... and exchanged telephone numbers ...\\n...\\nAccording to [expert witnesses Ms N. and Ms M.], the borders of Bolotnaya Square in Moscow are delimited by Vodootvodnyy channel, Serafimovicha Street, Sofiyskaya embankment and Faleyevskiy passage, and the [park] forms a part of Bolotnaya Square. During public events at Bolotnaya Square the park is always cordoned off and is not used for the passage of citizens.\\nThese testimonies are fully corroborated by the reply of the Head of the Yakimanka District Municipality of Moscow of 27 July 2012 and the map indicating the borders of Bolotnaya Square.\\n...\\n[The court finds] that the place of the sit-in ... was outside the venue approved by the Moscow authorities for the public event ...\\n...\\nThe organisation of mass disorder may take the form of incitement and controlling the crowd’s actions, directing it to act in breach of the law, or putting forward various demands to the authorities’ representatives. This activity may take different forms, in particular the planning and preparation of such actions, the selection of groups of people to provoke and fuel mass disorder, incitement to commit it, by filing petitions and creating slogans, announcing calls and appeals capable of electrifying the crowd and causing it to feel appalled, influencing people’s attitudes by disseminating leaflets, using the mass media, meetings and various forms of agitation, in developing a plan of crowd activity taking into account people’s moods and accumulated grievances, or guiding the crowd directly to commit mass disorder.\\n... this offence is considered accomplished as soon as at least one of the actions enumerated under Article 212 § 1 of the Criminal Code has been carried out ...\\n... the criminal offence of organisation of mass disorder is considered accomplished when organisational activity has been carried out and does not depend on the occurrence or non-occurrence of harmful consequences.\\n...\\nThere are no grounds to consider the closure of access to the park of Bolotnaya Square and the placement of a guiding police cordon at the foot of Malyy Kamennyy bridge to be a provocation ... since it was only to indicate the direction and it did not obstruct access to the meeting venue at Bolotnaya Square.\\n... the reinforcement of the cordon ... was necessary in the circumstances ... to prevent it from breaking ... but the police [cordon] did not advance towards the protesters.\\nIt is therefore fully proven that the mass disorder organised by Mr Udaltsov [and others] ... led to the destabilisation of public order and peace in a public place during the conduct of a public event, put a large number of people in danger, including those who had come to fulfil their constitutional right to congregate in peaceful marches and meetings, and led to considerable psychological tension in the vicinity of Bolotnaya Square in Moscow, accompanied by violence against the police ... and the destruction of property ...”', '64.  The Moscow City Court sentenced Mr Udaltsov and Mr Razvozzhayev to four and a half years’ imprisonment. On 18 March 2015 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment of 24 July 2014, with a number of amendments.', '65.  On 18 August 2014 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow examined another “Bolotnaya” case and found four individuals guilty of participating in mass disorder and committing violent acts against police officers during the demonstration on 6 May 2012. They received prison sentences of between two and a half and three and a half years; one of them was released on parole. That judgment was upheld by the Moscow City Court on 27 November 2014.', '66.  On 6 May 2012 the applicant arrived at Bolotnaya Square at about 6 p.m. to take part in the meeting. He stood in front of the stage on Bolotnaya embankment, within the area designated as the meeting venue.', '67.  According to the applicant, between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. the area around him remained peaceful, although there was general confusion. He claimed that he had not heard any announcement about the termination of the meeting; he had heard the police orders made through a megaphone to disperse, but in the general commotion he was unable to leave immediately and remained within the authorised meeting area until 7 p.m., when he was arbitrarily arrested by the police dispersing the demonstration. The applicant denied that he had received any warning or orders before being arrested. The police apprehended him and took him to a police van, where he waited for an hour before it left Bolotnaya Square for the police station. According to the applicant, there was no traffic at Bolotnaya Square at the time of his arrest; it was still suspended.', '68.  According to the Government, the applicant was arrested at 8.30 p.m. at Bolotnaya Square because he was obstructing the traffic and had disregarded the police order to move away.', '69.  At 9.30 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Krasnoselskiy District police station in Moscow. At the police station an on-duty officer drew up a statement on an administrative offence (протокол об административном правонарушении) on the basis of a report (рапорт) by Police Officer Y., who had allegedly arrested the applicant. Y.’s report contained the following handwritten statement:\\n“I [Y.] report that on 6 May 2012 at 9.30 p.m., at 5/16 Bolotnaya Square, together with Police Lieutenant [A.], I arrested Mr Frumkin.”', '70.  The rest of the report was a printed template stating as follows:\\n“... who, acting in a group of citizens, took part in an authorised meeting, went out onto the road and thus obstructed the traffic. [He] did not react to the multiple demands of the police to vacate the road ..., thereby disobeying a lawful order of the police, who were fulfilling their service duty of maintaining public order and ensuring safety. He thereby committed an administrative offence under Article 19.3 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences.”', '71.  The statement on the administrative offence contained an identical text, but indicated that the applicant had been arrested at 8.30 p.m. The applicant was charged with obstructing traffic and disobeying lawful police orders, an offence under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences. His administrative detention was ordered with reference to Article 27.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences (протокол об административном задержании). The “reasons” section of the order remained blank.', '72.  At 2 p.m. on 7 May 2012 the applicant was taken to court, but his case was not examined. After having spent the day in a transit van without food or drink, at 11.55 p.m. he was taken back to the cell at the Krasnoselskiy District police station. A new order for the applicant’s administrative detention was issued, indicating that he had been detained “for the purpose of drawing up the administrative material”.', '73.  At 8 a.m. on 8 May 2012 the applicant was brought before the Justice of the Peace of circuit no. 100 of the Yakimanka District, who examined the charges. The applicant requested that the case be adjourned on the grounds that he was unfit to stand trial after the detention; he also requested that the hearing be opened to the public and that two police officers be examined as witnesses. Those requests were rejected in order to expedite the proceedings. A further request for the examination of several eyewitnesses was partly refused and partly granted. Three witnesses for the defence were examined.', '74.  On the basis of the report written by Police Officer Y., the court established that at 8.30 p.m. on 6 May 2012 the applicant had been walking along the road at Bolotnaya Square and obstructing the traffic, and that he had then disobeyed lawful police orders to vacate the venue. The Justice of the Peace rejected as unreliable two eyewitnesses’ testimonies to the effect that the police had not given the applicant any orders or warnings before arresting him. The applicant was found guilty of disobeying lawful police orders, and was sentenced under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences to fifteen days’ administrative detention.', '75.  On 11 May 2012 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow examined an appeal lodged by the applicant. At the applicant’s request the court examined Ms S. as a witness. She testified that at 7.46 p.m. on 6 May 2012 she had been looking for her son when she saw the applicant in a police van and spoke to him. She also testified that at 9.03 p.m. she had been at Bolotnaya Square; the site had been fully cordoned off and the traffic had not resumed. The court rejected the applicant’s argument that the police report and the police statement were inconsistent as regards the time of his arrest and found that the correct interpretation of those documents was that the time of arrest had been 8.30 p.m. and the detention at the police station 9.30 p.m. The court dismissed the video recording submitted by the applicant on the grounds that it did not contain the date and the time of the incident, but found that the applicant’s guilt had been proved by other evidence. It upheld the first-instance judgment.', '76.  On 11 January 2013 the Deputy President of the Moscow City Court examined the applicant’s administrative case in supervisory-review proceedings and upheld the earlier judicial decisions.'], 'applicants': ['FRUMKIN'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10', '11', '5', '18', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '5', '11'], 'court_assessment_references': {'11': ['112', '114', '117', '131', '139', '16', '163', '21', '22', '34', '48', '49', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '63', '65'], '5': ['140'], '6': ['155'], '18': ['141']}, 'silver_rationales': [11, 16, 17, 29, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 60], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [11, 16, 17, 29, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 60], 'explained_indices': [2, 3, 4, 1, 35, 51, 50, 48, 47, 46, 45, 43, 52, 42, 41, 39, 38, 44, 53, 55, 37, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 54, 36, 71, 34, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 70, 20, 19, 28, 33, 23, 24, 25, 32, 26, 27, 21, 29, 30, 67, 31, 22, 13, 58, 49, 40, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.054749273, 0.03868966, 0.025391964, 0.008820392, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.007057365, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0070573427, 0.0026185513], 'number_of_sentences': 72, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Częstochowa.', '5.  On 26 September 2004 the applicant was arrested by the police.', '6.  On 28 September 2004 the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand in view of a reasonable suspicion that he had offered a bribe to a Member of Parliament, Mr A.P. The applicant was charged together with Mr M.D., a well‑known businessman and lobbyist and his business partner. Mr M.D.’s case received wide media coverage and aroused a great deal of political interest. The court established that his detention was essential to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. It also referred to the likelihood that a severe sentence might be imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he would influence witnesses.', '7.  The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed on an unspecified date.', '8.  On 21 December 2004 and 22 March and 21 June 2005 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention. It relied on the grounds previously relied on.', '9.  The applicant’s appeals against those decisions were dismissed.', '10.  On 21 September and 21 December 2005 the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention pending the outcome of the investigation. The court referred to the extraordinary complexity of the case, which concerned charges of corruption involving high‑ranking public officials, and reiterated that other preventive measures would not secure the applicant’s attendance at his trial.', '11.  The applicant’s detention was then extended by the Court of Appeal on 8 February, 10 May, 21 June, 20 September and 6 December 2006. The court found that there were circumstances justifying the fact that the investigation in the applicant’s case had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor. On the last above‑mentioned date the court also decided that the applicant could be released on bail in the amount of 300,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately 76,000 euros (EUR)).', '12.  The applicant’s appeals against all the decisions to extend his detention were dismissed. His numerous applications for release were also to no avail.', '13.  On 5 January 2007 the applicant paid the bail and his pre‑trial detention was lifted.', '14.  On 20 January 2007 the Katowice Appeals Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant, Mr M.D. and Mr A.P.', '15.  The trial court scheduled the first hearing for 27 September 2007, but it was cancelled.', '16.  On 25 June 2012 the Pabianice District Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to two years and ten months’ imprisonment and a fine (II K 293/07). The judgment is not final and the applicant applied to receive a reasoned copy of the judgment with a view to lodging an appeal against it.', '17.  It appears that on 20 July 2004 the prosecutor initiated a new investigation against the applicant and other co‑accused including Mr. M.D.', '18.  On 8 March 2005 the charges against the applicant were supplemented with the addition of a charge of money laundering contrary to Article 229 of the Criminal Code. The investigation was conducted within the above‑described proceedings until 14 November 2005. Subsequently, the charge under Article 229 of the Code was severed, to be dealt with in another set of proceedings.', '19.  The charges were supplemented in April and September 2007. In January 2008 the charges against the applicant were further supplemented with the addition of a charge of forgery contrary to Article 271 of the Criminal Code.', '20.  On 14 January 2008 the applicant was arrested by the police and the prosecutor applied to the court with a motion to impose pre‑trial detention on the applicant in this set of proceedings.', '21.  On 15 January 2008 the Katowice District Court decided to allow the prosecutor’s request and remanded the applicant in custody. The court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the risk that a severe sentence would be imposed on him. The court however considered, contrary to the prosecutor’s assessment, that there was no risk that the applicant would tamper with the proper course of the proceedings. It noted that the proceedings in the instant case had been pending for a long time and the applicant, while at liberty, had not made any attempt to interfere with their proper course. The court therefore considered that other preventive measures could secure the applicant’s attendance at his trial and set bail in the amount of PLN 100,000.', '22.  The applicant’s family attempted to pay the bail. However, the enforcement of the decision of 15 January 2008 was stayed because the prosecutor had lodged an appeal against it.', '23.  It appears that the court allowed the appeal on 5 March 2008 and extended the applicant’s detention.', '24.  On 11 April 2008 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the prosecutor’s motion to further extend the applicant’s detention and decided to place him under police supervision and prohibit him from leaving the country. The court also criticised the prosecutor in that he had refused to indicate what investigative measures he had been planning to take in the ongoing investigation. Relying on the case‑law of the Strasbourg Court the Warsaw Regional Court considered that concealing planned actions from the defence constituted a breach of defence rights in violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.', '25.  On 15 April 2008 the applicant was released from detention.', '26.  The prosecutor lodged an appeal against the decision.', '27.  On 27 May 2008 the Warsaw Court of Appeal allowed the prosecutor’s appeal and extended the applicant’s pre‑trial detention. The court disagreed with the lower court’s assessment and considered that the prosecutor had communicated to the applicant sufficiently justified reasons for extending his pre‑trial detention to comply with the Convention standards. The court reiterated that the prosecutor’s motions had not been confidential and had been ultimately transmitted to the applicant and his lawyers. At the same time both Polish law and the Convention case‑law allowed for some information to be withheld from the applicant in order to secure the efficient conduct of the investigation.', '28.  On 28 May 2008 the applicant returned to the detention centre.', '29.  On 25 February 2009 the Katowice Court of Appeal decided to further extend the applicant’s pre‑trial detention until 31 May 2009. At the same time the court decided that the applicant could be released on bail of PLN 300,000 (approx. EUR 70,000). The court underlined that the risk that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant should be assessed taking into account the circumstances of the case i.e. the amount of evidence that had been collected, the length of detention so far and the possibility to apply other measures to secure the applicant’s attendance at his trial.', '30.  It appears that the applicant paid the bail. He was released from pre‑trial detention on 8 April 2009.', '31.  On 24 May 2011 the Katowice Appellate Prosecutor discontinued the investigation against the applicant relating to tax offences finding that no offence had been committed.', '32.  On 22 June 2011 and on 21 February 2012 the Katowice Appellate Prosecutor lodged bills of indictment against the applicant on certain tax fraud- related charges.', '33.  The remaining part of the investigation against the applicant and other co‑accused is pending before the Katowice Appeals Prosecutor (no. Ap V Ds. 6/09/s). On 22 December 2011 the prosecutor stayed the investigation in this case.', '34.  On 22 December 2009 the Warsaw Court of Appeal allowed the applicant’s complaint and found that his right to a trial within a reasonable time had been breached in respect of the investigation carried out by the prosecutor (no. Ap V Ds. 6/09/s). It awarded the applicant PLN 10,000 (which amounted to EUR 2,300 at the material time) in compensation. The applicant relied on the amended Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to an investigation conducted or supervised by a prosecutor and to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).', '35.  The court noted that the investigation in the instant case had started on 20 July 2004 and was still pending. The investigation was extended on several occasions as new charges had been brought against the applicant and six co‑accused. The court considered that many unrelated charges, mostly concerning one co‑accused, Mr M.D., had been joined to the investigation against the applicant although they had not concerned his case. Moreover, it criticised the prosecutor’s approach of repeatedly supplementing the investigation by adding new unrelated charges against the applicant which had clearly caused protraction of the main investigation against him.', '36.  The court agreed with the prosecutor that the case was complex. However, it noted that there had been many delays and that many of the actions could have been carried out earlier. For instance, as regards one charge against Mr M.D., witnesses were heard in July 2009, three years after the relevant events had been disclosed by the prosecutor. Moreover, this charge was totally unrelated to the present investigation against the applicant and should have been dealt with in another set of proceedings. A piece of evidence, a telephone, was examined one year after it had been seized by the prosecuting authorities. The court noted other delays in the examination of a piece of evidence disclosed in August 2008 which resulted in the preparation of an expert opinion only in March 2009. The Warsaw Court of Appeal also observed that while in 2005 the applicant had often been heard by the prosecutor, later, particularly between 2006 and 2008, the prosecutor heard the applicant at much longer intervals.', '37.  The court also noted many periods of inactivity on the part of the prosecutor in connection with his multiple requests for international legal assistance. For instance, delays occurred between July 2008 and January 2009 when the prosecutor did not react to a reply to his request for legal assistance from Latvia. What is more, this request had no relevance to the investigation against the applicant although it influenced its length. The court considered that many of those requests for legal assistance had related not to the charges that had already been brought against the applicant or the co‑accused but to the investigation of new circumstances which might result in new charges being laid against them in future.', '38.  The court therefore considered that the complexity of the case could not justify the fact that the investigation has been pending for five years. Nor did the applicant contribute to the length of the proceedings.', '39.  The court finally instructed the prosecutor to intensify his activity in the case, so that the investigation could be terminated by 30 March 2010. However, the prosecutor did not manage to close the investigation by that date and the proceedings relating to the main charge are still pending (see paragraph 33 above).', '40.  The Government submitted that at the pre‑trial stage of the first set of proceedings the applicant was granted access to the case file on four occasions in 2005 and 2006 and in January 2007. At the judicial stage the applicant consulted his file in July and August 2008. However, in September 2006 the prosecutor refused to allow the applicant access to some parts of the file.', '41.  As regards the second set of proceedings the Government acknowledged that the applicant was temporarily refused access to the case file by the prosecutor’s decisions of 6 December 2006, 31 August 2007 and 29 January 2008. However, the applicant was subsequently allowed to consult the file.', '42.  The applicant did not contest the Government’s submissions. He submitted copies of the prosecutor’s decisions of 6 December 2006 and 31 August 2007 refusing the applicant and his lawyers access to the case file. The applicant appealed against both decisions; however an appellate prosecutor dismissed them. The applicant also provided a copy of the decision of 29 January 2008, notified to the applicant’s lawyer on 2 February 2008, in which the prosecutor refused him access to the file and to transmit to him a reasoned copy of the prosecutor’s motion to impose detention on remand on the applicant.\\nThe applicant also provided copies of the prosecutor’s reasoned motions of 15 January 2008 to impose detention on remand on him and of 28 March 2008 to extend his detention.', '43.  During the applicant’s detention his wife and three children lodged multiple requests for permission to visit him in the detention centre. On 4 July 2008 the Katowice Appeals Prosecutor dismissed the request of his wife and two sons for leave to visit the applicant. The decision contained no reasons.', '44.  The applicant submitted that while he had been detained on remand certain doctors recommended that he undergo surgery; however, an operation could not be carried out in the detention centre. Moreover, he was placed in the same cell with a detainee who had been charged with murder who was awaiting transfer to a medical wing.'], 'applicants': ['POPENDA'], 'defendants': ['POLAND'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '8'], 'violated_articles': ['8', '5'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['27', '42', '74'], '8': ['43']}, 'silver_rationales': [23, 38, 39], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [23, 38, 39], 'explained_indices': [5, 1, 3, 10, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 20, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 32, 22, 40, 39, 11, 21, 13, 14, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 15, 0, 9, 8, 4, 7, 6, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.026334554, 0.010117143, 0.007883161, 0.0012409687, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.0011872947, 0.00013959408, -0.0035270154, -0.028893381, -0.09584129, -0.16923779, -0.2971635, -0.34470624], 'number_of_sentences': 41, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Lublin, Poland.', '10.  On 23 May 1996 the applicant was taken into custody by the police. On 24 May 1996 the Lublin District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) charged the applicant with hiding a stolen car and possession of a counterfeit banknote and remanded him in custody. The District Prosecutor considered that there existed a danger of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses. Moreover, he referred to a significant danger to society of the criminal acts allegedly committed by the applicant.', \"11.  The applicant appealed against the District Prosecutor's decision but on 18 June 1996 the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his appeal. The court considered that the reasons given for the applicant's detention had not ceased to exist.\", \"12.  On 14 August 1996 the Lublin Regional Court extended the applicant's detention until 23 November 1996.

The applicant appealed against this decision but on 15 January 1997 the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. The appellate court referred to Articles 209 and 217 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It considered that the prison term to which the applicant could be sentenced justified his detention.

On 10 April 2006 a group of seven people living in the Dokuzparinskiy District of Dagestan, a mountainous region close to the border with Azerbaijan, posted a written notice informing the district authorities that on 25 April 2006 they would hold a public demonstration in the village of Usukhchay. The applicants’ names were not mentioned in the list of organisers of the demonstration. The principal aims of the demonstration were to criticise the work of the head of the local administration, Mr A., to denounce corruption and the misuse of public funds by the local administration, and to draw attention to the inactivity of the law-enforcement agencies vis-à-vis abuses committed by Mr A. and his colleagues. The demonstration was supposed to be held in a recreational park in the village of Usukhchay from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the estimated number of participants was 5,000. The organisers asked the police to dispatch officers for the protection of those participating in the demonstration. Although the applicants’ names were not in the notice, they claimed that they had played an active part in the organisation of the meeting in their respective communities.', '6.  The notice (уведомление) was sent to the district administration with copies to the Dokuzparinskiy district prosecutor and the head of the district police department. The applicants produced a copy of a payment slip from a post office in Makhachkala indicating that the notice had been posted by registered mail on 10 April 2006. It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that the notice was received by the district administration on 17 April 2006.', '7.  On 17 April 2006 the head of the district administration, Mr A. – the same person who was the principle target of the criticism by the demonstrators – informed the organisers that the district administration was opposed to the demonstration. In his letter of 17 April 2006 Mr A. said that, first, the notice had been lodged (подано) outside the time-limit fixed in the Public Gatherings Act. Secondly, the park in Usukhchay was not supposed to admit more than 500 people, so it was impossible to hold a demonstration there. Thirdly, the purpose of the demonstration was to condemn the embezzlement of public funds and the deliberate destruction of financial records by the district administration. However, according to Mr A., the competent law-enforcement authorities, in particular the prosecutor’s office, and financial authorities such as the Ministry of Finance of Dagestan, had already inquired into those allegations and concluded that there had been no case to answer. The letter also contained a warning addressed to the organisers that if they proceeded with the demonstration as planned, they would be held liable in accordance with the law.', '8.  At about 4 p.m. on 19 April 2006, a group of men armed with iron rods and sticks attacked another group of individuals near the village of Khiv. Two persons were injured. Having received information about the clash, the Derbent police dispatched a group of officers to the scene. The police set up an improvised roadblock near the “Gereykhanov Sovkhoz” (Kasumkent village) to check the passing cars and prevent further clashes. A few hours later a group of about 300 people armed with wooden sticks, iron rods and similar objects arrived at the roadblock in several cars without licence plates. The police stopped those cars. According to the authorities, the second applicant then climbed onto the roof of his car and started to incite his fellow villagers to resist the police and to run them over. His followers started to abuse the police verbally, pushed them out of their way and tried to overturn a police vehicle and a truck which the police had used to block the road. One of the police officers was injured, and his uniform was ripped. As a result, the police gave up and let the cars pass.', '9.  The second applicant denied having participated in the scuffle. He maintained that on that day he had been taking part in a gathering in the Kurakhskiy District. As to the episode near the police roadblock, he claimed that he had argued with the police officers, asking them to let him and his car through, and the windscreen of his car had been broken by them. However, he had not committed any unlawful acts.', '10.  On an unspecified date the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation into the events of 19 April 2006 (case no. 6424).', '11.  On 21 April 2006 the second applicant was arrested with reference to case no. 6424, which concerned the riot on 19 April 2006 in the village of Khiv. On 22 April 2006 the Khiv District Court granted the police’s request to detain the second applicant on remand. The second applicant was suspected of having committed a crime under Article 212 § 3 (“Mass riots”), and Article 318 § 1 (“Use of violence against a public official”) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. The court ruled that the second applicant should be detained because otherwise he might obstruct the establishment of the truth, destroy evidence or abscond. The second applicant appealed, claiming that the court’s decision was unsubstantiated, but on 28 April 2006 the Supreme Court of Dagestan dismissed the appeal in a summary fashion.', '12.  On 20 June 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala ordered the second applicant’s release, indicating that he had a permanent place of residence, three children to take care of and an elderly father who was ill, and that the charges against him were not serious. The second applicant was released.', '13.  Subsequently, the criminal case against the second applicant was closed by the trial court for “active repentance”.', '14.  Despite the decision of the local administration of 17 April 2006 whereby the demonstration of 25 April 2006 had not been allowed, the organisers decided to hold it as planned. The first and the third applicants took part in that “unauthorised” demonstration; the second applicant was not amongst the protesters since at that time he had been detained on remand in connection with the episode of on 19 April 2006 in the village of Khiv (see paragraphs 8 to 13 above).', '15.  At about 10 a.m. on 25 April 2006, a group of approximately 1,000 people gathered on the outskirts of Usukhchay. Other demonstrators were unable to reach the assembly point because the roads had been blocked by the police.', '16.  The organisers tried to meet representatives of the village administration in order to discuss the situation, but to no avail. When the demonstrators started moving towards the centre of the village, the police blocked their way. At the same time another group of demonstrators from the neighbouring village of Miskindzha were stopped by the police on the way to Usukhchay; they were ordered to return to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there separately, if they so wished.', '17.  In the afternoon the demonstrators from Usukhchay started moving towards Miskindzha. As the police had blocked the road, the demonstrators had to leave their cars and walk. Because of the bad weather and the long distance to walk, some of them decided to give up. As a result, when the demonstration arrived at Miskindzha, there were no more than 200 to 300 participants.', '18.  The meeting was peaceful; however, at about 3 p.m. the demonstrators were encircled by police officers from the Special Police Force Unit (the “OMON”). The police opened fire with automatic rifles above the demonstrators’ heads. They also used tear gas, smoke bombs and stun grenades to disperse the demonstration. The demonstrators started to run in the direction of the village; the police officers followed them. The police beat the demonstrators with rubber truncheons and rifle butts. As a result, one person was shot dead, five people were severely injured and several dozen people were beaten up or were injured by the shells of the tear-gas bombs which had exploded in the midst of the crowd. Sixty-seven people were arrested, and the organisers of the meeting were charged in connection with their participation in the organisation of an unauthorised demonstration. From the first and the third applicants’ submissions it appears that they were present at the scene of the confrontation in Miskindzha up to a certain moment but left when the clash started at about 3 p.m. None of them was hurt during the clash.', '19.  As to the gunshot injury received by a police officer, one of the participants in the demonstration, referring to the words of another witness, Mr S.F., claimed that the wound had been self-inflicted: the officer concerned had shot himself in the leg by accident, because his gun had not been locked.', '20.  On 24 April 2006 the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Dagestan issued Order No. 7 “On measures to stabilise the situation in the Dokuzparinskiy District of Dagestan”. The order described the unauthorised demonstration of 25 April 2006, which supposedly would involve about two thousand people “with an aggressive predisposition”. The order mentioned the risks of blocking the roads and disturbing the normal work of State institutions. A “mixed squad” was formed comprising of thirty-five police officers from the Special Forces Unit of the Ministry (OMON) and 147 officers from eight local police stations. Colonel Iz. was appointed as commander of the “mixed squad”. The order provided for undercover observation of the leaders of the demonstrators, video-recording of the events, strengthening of identity checks at the roadblocks and other security measures.', '21.  The squad moved to Usukhchay and took position at several roadblocks controlling roads leading to the village and near certain buildings occupied by State bodies. The aim of the operation was to secure public order, guarantee the constitutional rights and freedoms of the population and prevent clashes between the supporters of Mr A. and his opponents.', '22.  In their observations, the Government claimed that on the eve of the demonstration someone had taken alcohol, foodstuff and illegal drugs to Usukhchay. It had all been distributed amongst the residents of the village. In addition, there was information about individuals from other villages who had arrived in Usukchay with the aim of inciting the local population to participate in the unlawful demonstration and to insubordination to the law‑enforcement authorities.', '23.  At about 11 a.m. on 25 April 2006, three groups of people gathered near the premises of the village administration. One group of about 150 people were supporters of Mr A., the head of the district administration. The two other groups – which counted about one thousand people in aggregate – were the opponents of Mr A. Official documents contained in the case file also refer to another group of about 450 to 500 people, who arrived in Usukhchay to take part in the demonstration; it is unclear whether that group was able to join the gathering in the centre or was stopped by the police on the outskirts of the village.', '24.  In view of the risk of clashes between the opposing groups, representatives of the protesters were invited to take part in negotiations in the local prosecutor’s office. The negotiations involved Colonel Iz., the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Dagestan, the prosecutor, Ms Lg., and the head of the local police, Mr Akb. The authorities proposed to the organisers that they could hold the demonstration in a municipal garage.', '25.  However, that offer was declined. The demonstrators started to move from Usukhchay to Miskindzha, where they arrived at about 1 or 2 p.m. In the meantime, however, someone had blocked the road with objects including paving stones, timber beams and water pipes. This was a federal‑level road connecting several villages and its blockage caused a considerable traffic jam.', '26.  The authorities warned the organisers that if the road remained blocked, the organisers would be held liable, and that the law-enforcement authorities present on the spot would use force and “special equipment”.', '27.  The organisers refused to follow the instructions and told other demonstrators to disobey the police orders. When the police, following the orders of Deputy Minister Colonel Iz., started to remove the barricade from the road, unidentified men in the crowd started to throw stones at them. In addition, several shots were fired from a garden situated uphill on the left side of the road. Some of the protesters were armed with cold weapons such as iron rods, which they used as bats while attacking the police, whereas others tried to grab the service guns from the police officers.', '28.  As a result, the police had to use firearms and special equipment. In particular, they used two stun grenades, twenty-three tear-gas grenades, thirty‑six rubber bullets, and fired 747 shots from automatic rifles above the heads of the crowd. Fifty-two of the most active protesters were arrested and taken to the Dokuzparinskiy police station.', '29.  In addition, unidentified police officers used pump-action shotguns loaded with 22 mm grenades filled with tear gas. Those shots were fired in the direction of the crowd.', '30.  Following the clash between the police and the demonstrators, several police officers were injured. Eleven had bruises on their arms and legs, scratches and concussion; one had a ruptured spleen; and one, Mr Il., had a gunshot wound in the form of a perforated bullet hole in the right thigh.', '31.  Four civilians were seriously injured and one died. Mr Akh. had a blunt gunshot wound to the right side of the thorax with fractured ribs; Mr Nsr. had a gunshot wound to the left side of the thorax with broken shoulder bones; Mr Al. was wounded by a shell fragment in the right shin and thigh; Mr Gnd. had a gunshot wound to the right forearm with a fractured bone; and Mr Ng. received a mortal wound by a gas grenade to the thorax and died on the way to hospital.', '32.  In support of their account, the Government produced some documents apparently obtained in the course of the investigation (case no. 67610). It is unclear, however, whether all those documents related to case No. 67610 and whether they constituted the entirety of the materials collected within that case. The content of those documents, insofar as relevant, is described below.', '33.  The Government produced medical certificates describing the injuries of several police officers, but not Mr Il. They also produced several medical certificates describing the injuries sustained by the protesters, all of whom had bruises and scratches. According to the certificates, the protesters claimed that the police had kicked, beaten and battered them with rubber truncheons and gun butts. Some of the protesters had been injured by the rubber bullets used by the police. Others claimed that they had been beaten up after having been arrested and taken to the police station.', '34.  In his testimony Mr Akb., the head of the Dokuzparinskiy police, gave an account of the events which was generally consonant with that of the Government. He said that he had been warned about the demonstration in a telegram sent by the organisers. On 17 April 2006 he had met one of them and discussed the event. He further explained that at some time after 10 a.m. on 25 April 2006, his men had stopped a large group of protesters who had been trying to enter Usukhchay. Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p.m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p.m. the road had been unblocked.', '35.  Mr Yakh., one of the protesters, testified that when they had arrived in Miskindzha, the road had not yet been blocked. People had started to block the road spontaneously with stones in order to draw the authorities’ attention to their claims. The leaders of the demonstration, who spoke before the crowd, called everybody to order and asked them not to break the law. Then a police colonel appeared. He asked the leaders of the protesters to unblock the road, but they refused. The police then attacked the protesters from two sides and started to shoot and throw gas grenades into the crowd. People started to run in the direction of Miskindzha. Mr Yakh. testified that he had not seen protesters throwing stones at the police: by contrast, the police had thrown stones at the crowd in order to unblock the road.', '36.  Witness Mr Ag., a district administration official, testified that all the protesters, including women and elderly people, had been drunk, because earlier a mini-lorry had brought a cargo of vodka which had been distributed to the protesters. Mr Ag. joined the crowd and went with the protesters to Miskindzha, where he listened to the speeches of the leaders of the demonstration before a crowd of approximately 300 people. After the failure of the negotiations between the protesters and the authorities, the leaders started to incite the protesters to throw stones; he also heard the sound of shots coming from the side where the protesters had gathered. A police officer was wounded. The police started to move towards the protesters and fired two or three warning shots above their heads. When the police started to remove the stones from the road and arrest the protesters, Mr Ag. left. On the way back he overheard two women complaining that the organisers had not paid them and that they had been used as a human shield against the police.', '37.  According to an undated report by the head of the Special Forces Unit, Major Kr., the police had started using gas grenades only when a large group of about 1,000 men armed with iron rods, wooden sticks and knives had attacked them. Major Kr. also specified that when his officers were moving from the first barricade to the second, someone had started to shoot at them from under the nearby trees with an automatic gun and a hunter’s gun.', '38.  Witness Mr Agb. testified that on 25 April 2006 he had been going on his business but had been stopped by the crowd. He had heard the first applicant calling the protesters not to block the road but to gather in the community centre of Miskindzha. However, some of the demonstrators disobeyed; two lorries arrived and dumped stones on the road. Some of the protesters were throwing stones at the police.', '39.  One of the witnesses, Mr Chub., was the driver of the lorry that had brought stones for the first barricade. He explained that he had loaded the stones near the river in order to build a shed in his garden. Near the entry to Miskindzha he was stopped by a group of youngsters who ordered him, under the threat of violence, to dump the stones directly on the road.', '40.  The written testimonies of several other eyewitnesses were inconclusive. Some of them testified that a group of adolescents had been throwing stones at the police; others said that the police had used firearms by shooting in the air, whereas the demonstrators had no firearms. Some witnesses heard shots from the side of the protesters.', '41.  On 29 April 2006 the first applicant was arrested for participating in the organisation of an unauthorised demonstration on 25 April 2006 (criminal case no. 67610). He was suspected of having committed a crime under Article 213 § 2 (“Hooliganism”), and Article 318 § 2 (“Use of violence against a public official”) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (for all further references to the Criminal Code see “Relevant domestic law” below).', '42.  In particular, the police suspected that the first applicant had incited the demonstrators to block the road and to “disobey the lawful orders of the police with the use of firearms”. The police applied to the Sovetskiy District Court for a detention order against the first applicant.', '43.  According to the Government, the decision of the Prosecutor of the Dagestan Republic (hereinafter “the RPO”, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office) to seek the first applicant’s detention was based on the witness statements of Mr Als., Mr Agsh., Mr Shk. and an anonymous witness. Those witnesses identified the first applicant as one of the leaders of the demonstration who had incited the crowd to attack the police.', '44.  On 30 April 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala placed the first applicant in pre-trial detention. In its ruling the court noted that he was suspected of having committed a serious crime and that he might continue his criminal activity, abscond or obstruct the course of justice. The court also referred to his “personality”.', '45.  The first applicant’s lawyer appealed. He indicated that the first applicant worked as head of a municipal social-security office, had a permanent place of residence and four children, and had good references from his colleagues and neighbours. The lawyer also stated that the first applicant had not been contacted by the investigators before his arrest. The lawyer noted that a suspect could be held in pre-trial detention before being formally charged only in exceptional circumstances. The court’s ruling did not refer to any specific facts showing that the first applicant indeed intended to continue his criminal activities, abscond or obstruct the course of justice. Furthermore, the lawyer pointed to various irregularities in the application by the police and in the court’s ruling imposing the detention order.', '46.  On 6 May 2006 the Supreme Court of Dagestan dismissed the appeal in a summary fashion. The Supreme Court’s reasoning was identical to that of the lower court.', '47.  On 8 May 2006 the first applicant was charged under Article 213 § 3 and Article 318 § 2 of the Criminal Code. In the indictment the first applicant was referred to as “the organiser of the demonstration”. The indictment also mentioned that, as one of the organisers of the demonstration, the first applicant had ordered the protesters to block the road, throw stones in the direction of the police and use firearms.', '48.  It appears that in the meantime the first applicant had a confrontation with the witnesses who had earlier identified him as one of the instigators of the riot. According to the Government, they had all denied their previous allegations concerning his role in the riot.', '49.  On 27 June 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala refused to extend the first applicant’s pre-trial detention. The court ruled that the police had not produced any evidence that he might abscond or obstruct the course of justice, and that another preventive measure could not be applied. The court also stated that the need to question other demonstrators who had used violence against the police was not a good reason for extending his detention. The court lastly stated that the first applicant had no previous convictions, was married, was in employment, had good references, had been awarded State decorations and had a permanent place of residence. The first applicant was released.\\n(b)  Findings of the domestic investigation', '50.  On 25 December 2006 the criminal case against the first applicant was discontinued for lack of evidence. The investigator established that the road going to Miskindzha had been blocked by the protesters; when the police had tried to clear the road, the protesters had started to throw stones and sticks at them. Several police officers had been injured; police officer Il. had been wounded by a bullet fired from a hunter’s gun.', '51.  The investigator’s decision to discontinue the case referred to the protocol of examining the site of the clash during which he had discovered the following objects: 139 5.45 mm cartridges (the type used in the police’s automatic guns), one 7.45 mm cartridge (standard army Kalashnikov rifle), two cardboard cartridges (hunter’s gun) and one cartridge from a tear‑gas grenade.', '52.  The investigator further referred to the testimony of several demonstrators who had stated that when the police had approached the demonstrators, most of the people had remained calm. However, some time later, a group of young men whom the witnesses had identified as “the people of Mr Kanberov”, had arrived and started to throw stones and shout insults at the police.', '53.  Two police officers questioned by the investigator were granted anonymity. They testified that the leaders of the demonstration, including the first and third applicants, had ordered the protesters to disobey the police and throw stones at them. The testimony of the two anonymous witnesses was confirmed by several other police officers who testified under their real names, including Mr Sch. However, during a face-to-face confrontation with the first applicant, officer Sch. retracted his statement.', '54.  Police officer Mr Msl. testified that the first applicant had left the scene of the confrontation between 12 noon and 1 p.m., namely before the start of the clash, because of an emergency in his family. That fact was confirmed by witness Mr Dzhv. Witness Mr Um. testified that the first applicant had tried to persuade the protesters to follow the orders of the police and had designated thirty people to keep order during the demonstration.', '55.  The first and third applicants were also questioned. They denied their guilt and claimed that they had been collaborating with the police and had tried to call the protesters to order.', '56.  The investigator lastly referred to a video recording of the demonstration which showed that the first and third applicants had asked the protesters not to react to provocations and to remain calm.', '57.  On 25 December 2006 the first applicant was informed of his right to claim damages in connection with the criminal prosecution against him.', '58.  The third applicant was arrested on 29 April 2006. Whereas it is undisputed that the third applicant was present during the demonstration of 25 April 2006, his arrest was connected not to that demonstration but to his role in the events of 19 April 2006 in the village of Khiv and was ordered within criminal case no. 6424 (see paragraphs 8 to 13 above).', '59.  On 1 May 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala ordered the third applicant’s pre-trial detention. The court reasoned that as he might be given a prison sentence, he might abscond. The court noted that although the arrest warrant had been issued by the police on 20 April 2006, the third applicant had not been arrested until 29 April 2006.', '60.  The third applicant appealed. He stated, in particular, that before 29 April 2006 the police had not taken any steps to enforce the arrest warrant of 20 April 2006. He had been arrested on the premises of the Ministry of the Interior of Dagestan, where he had gone of his own motion.', '61.  On 6 May 2006 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the findings of the first-instance court in a summary fashion. On the same day the third applicant was charged under Articles 212 and 318 of the Criminal Code for participating in the events of 19 April 2006 in the village of Khiv. The charges against him were similar to those against the second applicant.', '62.  On 26 June 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala refused to extend the third applicant’s pre-trial detention. The court ruled that the police had not produced any evidence that he might abscond or obstruct the course of justice. The court also indicated that the need to conduct further investigative steps was not a legitimate reason for extending his detention. The court concluded that it was possible to apply a milder preventive measure. The third applicant was released.', '63.  As follows from the Government’s submissions, the accusations against the third applicant were based on the testimony of one witness. The prosecution authorities decided to drop the charges against him.', '64.  On 25 April 2006 the RPO ordered a criminal investigation into the events in Usukhchay and Miskindzha (case no. 67611). The facts were categorised under Article 105 § 2 (e) (“Murder”) and Article 222 (“Unlawful possession of or trafficking in firearms”) of the Criminal Code (“the CC”).', '65.  On 7 May 2006 Colonel Mk., acting head of the Special Forces Unit (OMON) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Dagestan, drew up a report on the events of 25 April 2006. He explained that the tear-gas grenades had been used when the protesters attacked the police with iron rods and tried to grab the service guns.', '66.  On 10 May 2006 an internal inquiry carried out by the federal Ministry of the Interior concluded that the police’s actions on 25 April 2006 had been appropriate. In particular, according to the final report of the inquiry, at 4.45 p.m. Colonel Iz. had ordered his officers to unblock the road, but the officers were attacked by a group of men armed with iron rods, stones and knives. Some of those men tried to grab the officers’ service guns. When the police entered Miskindzha, they discovered a lorry loaded with alcohol, cigarettes and foodstuff. Lieutenant-Colonel Mr Og. testified that his men had been fired at from the nearby gardens located on the left side of the road. Officer Il. (who had sustained a bullet wound to his thigh) testified that a hooded man had shot at him with a hunter’s gun. An appendix to the internal inquiry described restrictions on the use of gas grenades; in particular, it was prohibited to “shot gas grenades directly at humans”.', '67.  On an unspecified date in May 2006 the first applicant drafted and submitted to the investigator his account of the events of 25 April 2006 (a copy was submitted by the Government). He claimed that the demonstration had started peacefully, despite information that a group of Mr A.’s supporters had occupied the park in Usukhchay. During the negotiations with the authorities in the morning of 25 April 2006 the authorities’ representatives warned the protesters that if they insisted on holding the demonstration in Usukhchay, there would be bloodshed. In the afternoon, when the demonstrators refused to leave the road near Miskindzha, the police started to shoot and beat them with rubber truncheons. The first applicant submitted to the prosecutor a video recording of the start of the clash, and requested the questioning of several participants of the events.', '68.  On 19 October 2006 the RPO opened a criminal investigation under Article 286 § 3 (b) and (c) of the CC (“Abuse of office”) concerning the killing of Mr Ng. (case no. 668459).', '69.  On 4 December 2006 cases nos. 668459 and 67611 were joined.', '70.  According to the Government, within those two cases the investigators questioned more than seventy witnesses and conducted ballistic and medical forensic examinations. The relatives of the victims or the victims themselves were granted the status of victims in those proceedings.', '71.  However, the prosecution was unable to establish the persons responsible for the facts at the heart of the investigation. As a result, on 20 February 2007 the investigation was suspended. The investigator held that “in breach of the instruction on the use of special equipment ... No. 865dsp, officers of the Special Forces Unit ... fired twenty-three 23mm gas grenades ...” However, it was impossible to identify the police officers who had fired the fatal shot.', '72.  It appears that on an unidentified date the investigation was reopened and on 16 January 2010 it was suspended again.'], 'applicants': ['PRIMOV', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['11'], 'violated_articles': ['11'], 'court_assessment_references': {'11': ['141', '20', '34', '36', '37', '38', '40', '41', '50', '51', '52', '66', '8']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 15, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 45, 46, 47, 61], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 15, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 45, 46, 47, 61], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 0, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 49, 50, 52, 36, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 51, 35, 33, 66, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 34, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 18, 67], 'explained_distances': [0.24084914, 0.2279424, 0.15872985, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405, 0.00860405], 'number_of_sentences': 68, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Bersenevka, Republic of Mordovia.', '6.  On 5 March 2009 the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation in response to S.’s complaint that two policemen had extorted money from him by threatening to open a criminal case against him on charges of drug possession.', '7.  On 23 March 2009 the investigator received information implicating the applicant in said crime. On 30 March 2009 the investigating authorities established where the applicant was officially registered as living.', '8.  On 2 April 2009 the applicant was charged in absentia with kidnapping (Article 126 of the Russian Criminal Code) and extortion (Article 163 of the Russian Criminal Code). Noting that the applicant might abscond or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice, the investigator considered that the applicant should sign an undertaking not to leave his place of residence and to abstain from improper behaviour.', '9.  On 3 April 2009 the applicant’s name was put on the list of wanted persons. It was not elucidated in the relevant decision whether any effort had been taken on the part of the investigating authorities to establish the applicant’s whereabouts. On the same day the police informed the investigating authorities of the addresses where the applicant and his father were registered.', '10.  On 6 May 2010 the investigating authorities established the applicant’s temporary address.', '11.  On 24 June 2010 the applicant voluntarily went to see the investigator. He was questioned and released on his own recognisance. The next interview was scheduled for 1 July 2010. On that day the applicant duly appeared at the prosecutor’s office where he was arrested. When questioned, he claimed that the authorities had had no grounds to put his name on the list of wanted persons. In particular, he submitted that the investigating authorities had failed to verify his whereabouts or to issue a request for him to appear for questioning.', '12.  The following day, 2 July 2010, the Ostankinskiy District Court of Moscow authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 1 August 2010. In particular, the court noted as follows:\\n“... the court ... considers that, in view of the [applicant’s] character and the nature of the charges, if released, he might again abscond or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice. [The applicant] is charged with offences entailing a custodial sentence in excess of two years. As is apparent from the evidence submitted, he has absconded before and his name was put on the list of wanted persons. The court concludes that it is impossible to apply more lenient restrictions, such as release on bail.\\nThe court considers that there were grounds for the [applicant’s] arrest. It follows from the evidence submitted to the court that [the applicant] could have committed the crime he is charged with. As regards the fact that on 24 June 2009 the applicant voluntarily appeared for questioning, the court does not consider it sufficient to dismiss the [investigating authorities’] request for the [applicant] to be remanded in custody. [The applicant] did not deny that even though his name was on the list of wanted persons, he did not appear for [questioning] for two months.”', '13.  On 3 July 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against the court order of 2 July 2010. He addressed it to the Moscow City Court. On an unspecified date the City Court forwarded it to the District Court for processing. According to the Government, on an unspecified date the President of the District Court returned the statement of appeal to the applicant on the grounds that it had been lodged after the deadline. The applicant received the President’s decision on 27 July 2010 and asked the District Court to renew the time allowed for appeal.', '14.  On 28 July 2010 the District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 1 October 2010. The court noted as follows:\\n“When extending the [applicant’s] pre-trial detention, the court has taken into account [his] character. Nevertheless, it does not discern any grounds to cancel or replace the preventative measure previously imposed on [the applicant] ... given that the circumstances underlying the [applicant’s] detention pending trial have not altered. [The applicant] is charged with offences entailing a custodial sentence in excess of two years. Regard being had to the seriousness of the charges and to the fact that he absconded and that his name was put on the list of wanted persons, the court is convinced that [the applicant] might abscond or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice.\\nThe court dismisses as unsubstantiated the [applicant’s] allegations that he was unfit for detention because of his state of health. There are no documents in the case file [to the contrary]. Furthermore, the court notes that all persons detained in a remand prison receive the necessary medical assistance as provided for in the applicable legislation.”', '15.  According to the Government, on 17 August 2010 the District Court reset the time-limit for the applicant’s appeal against the court order of 2 July 2010.', '16.  On 18 August 2010 the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of 28 July 2010 on appeal.', '17.  On 25 August 2010 the applicant’s lawyer filed an additional statement of appeal against the court order of 2 July 2010.', '18.  On 6 September 2010 the City Court adjourned the hearing of the applicant’s appeal against the court order of 2 July 2010 owing to his lawyer’s failure to appear. On 8 September 2010 the City Court held the hearing and upheld the decision of 2 July 2010 on appeal.', '19.  On 29 September 2010 the District Court further extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 1 December 2010 noting as follows:\\n“... the court considers that there are no grounds justifying the lifting or changing of the restrictive measure imposed on [the applicant] ... in the court’s view, the defence’s request to release [the applicant] on bail will not have a restraining effect on the defendant as regards the possibility of him interfering with the administration of justice. Regard being had to the particular complexity of the case and to the scope of the pending investigation, the court considers the investigator’s request to extend the [applicant’s] pre-trial detention well-founded. Accordingly the court rejects the request for bail lodged by [the applicant] and his defence.\\nRegard being had to the above and the seriousness of the charges against [the applicant], the court does not consider it possible to apply a restrictive measure other than to remand the accused in custody ... ”', '20.  On 25 October 2010 the City Court upheld the decision of 29 September 2010 on appeal.', '21.  On 29 November 2010 the District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 1 January 2011. The court reasoned as follows:\\n“... the grounds underlying the [applicant’s] detention pending trial have not altered. [He] is charged with a grievous offence entailing a custodial sentence in excess of two years; he previously absconded and his name was put on the list of wanted persons; he is not employed and does not have an official source of income; he used to be a policeman and has relevant knowledge and experience; he is privy to the personal data of the victim and a witness. The evidence, the circumstances and the [applicant’s] character presented to the court lead it to believe that, if released, [the applicant] might abscond, continue criminal activities, threaten the victim and the witness, put pressure on them or otherwise interfere with the investigation of the case.”', '22.

The applicant asked for release on bail in the amount of 500,000 Russian roubles (RUB) to be paid by his cousin. The court further extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other defendant until 17 June 2011, noting as follows:\\n“Defendant M. is charged with grievous offences. [The applicant] is charged with grievous offences. Accordingly, [the court] considers that there are grounds to believe that, if released, M. and [the applicant] might abscond or otherwise interfere with the proceedings. The court does not discern any circumstances justifying lifting or changing the restriction. The release of defendant M. or [the applicant] might significantly complicate the comprehensive, complete and objective assessment of the circumstances of the case. The court also dismisses the [applicant’s] request for release on bail as unsubstantiated.”', '24.  On 9 February 2011 the City Court upheld the decision of 28 December 2010 on appeal.', '25.  On 13 April 2011 the District Court found the applicant guilty of extortion and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment.

In October-November 2011 the applicant underwent medical treatment in the hospital of remand prison no. IZ-77/1 in Moscow.', '30.  In response to the applicant’s complaint, the Moscow City Ombudsman made an enquiry as to the medical care provided in the remand prison.

According to the applicant, he was transported in a single-occupancy compartment only on two occasions. For the rest of the time, he was transported in a collective compartment which held up to eighteen detainees and measured 3.8 m by 2.35 m by 1.6 m. There were not enough seats for everyone and some people had to stand or sit on someone else’s lap. During the winter the vans were not heated. The ceiling and the walls were covered with ice. The floor in the van was extremely dirty. It was covered with cigarette butts, food crumbs, plastic bottles and bags of urine. The natural ventilation of the van through the hatches was insufficient. All the detainees smoked in the van and the applicant was exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. The light was off all the time.', '37.  On the days of the trial, the applicant was placed in a holding cell at the court-house measuring 2.5 by 1.5 metres. It was, according to the applicant, dirty, poorly lit and unventilated.

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Sopron.', '6. From 1994 the applicant’s family operated a grocery with the personal involvement of the applicant. They sold, initially under the excise licence of the applicant’s mother, merchandise subject to excise tax, that is, alcohol and tobacco products. On average, the turnover of tobacco retail represented about one-third of the family’s business.\\nThe applicant himself obtained a shop-keeping licence in 1999 (see also paragraph 15 below). In 2001 he qualified as a trader and shop manager. In 2005, he was registered in his own right as a trader of excise goods.', '7.  On 11 September 2012 Parliament enacted Act no. CXXXIV of 2012 on the Repression of Smoking of the Youth and on Tobacco Retail. The Act was published on 24 September 2012. The Act was subsequently amended on several occasions, and the final version was enacted on 6 June 2013. It entered into force on 1 July 2013.', '8.  According to the Act, tobacco retail – previously exercised at about 42,000 retail points nationwide – was to become a State monopoly (exercised through a State-owned company, ND Nemzeti Dohány-kereskedelmi Nonprofit Zrt, “ND Zrt”), and tobacco retailers would become licensed through a concession tender, advertised on 15 December 2012, for up to five retail points per tenderer. In applying for the new concessions, tenderers were required to produce business plans reflecting, inter alia, the new governmental policy to limit to the utmost the access of minors to tobacco products, notably by prohibiting the entry of those less than 18 years of age into shops selling tobacco. Under the new licences, tobacco retail could take place only in shops with separate entrances, with dark shades in the shop windows preventing seeing through, and with only a limited selection of other goods on sale.\\nThe final time-limit for applying was 22 February 2013. Entities previously engaged in tobacco retail had no privileges in the tender. The decision about the tenders was to be taken by ND Zrt.\\nIn the tender, altogether some 6,800 licences were granted nationwide[1].', '9.  The applicant applied for a concession on 4 February 2013, for the would-be licence to be used in the family enterprise. The application was signed by the applicant, and witnessed by his wife and their son. The applicant then amended the application according to the upcoming new rules, on 20 February 2013. According to the Government, the application was very succinct and in no way developed; in particular, it contained no appropriate business plan, which was part of the criteria for the tenders. The applicant submitted that no information was ever made available about the assessment of the tender.', '10.  On 23 April 2013 the applicant was informed that he had not obtained a tobacco retail concession. The decision contained no reasons or any indication of the applicant’s score on the 120-point tender adjudication score-sheet, and it was not subject to any legal remedy.\\nThe enterprise run by the applicant’s family was obliged to terminate the sale of tobacco products by the statutory deadline, that is, 14 July 2013. Tobacco wholesalers were under a legal obligation to re-buy any outstanding stocks from terminated retailers.\\nThe remaining sales activities of the applicant’s family enterprise were no longer profitable, entailing the winding-up of the business.', '11.  Under the law, no compensation is available for former holders of tobacco retail licences who, by not having been awarded a concession, lost part of their livelihood. The applicant submitted that this was the case of his family; and that he had, after losing the retail licence, considerable difficulties in supporting his family including a minor son.', '12.  The applicant further submitted that others in comparable situations – and in the case of those who had never been doing tobacco retail beforehand, in non-comparable situations – had been granted concessions, which difference in treatment could not be explained by any circumstance other than political adherence. In his view, this was corroborated by the fact that some successful tenderers had obtained more than one concession for multiple selling points.', '13.  On 14 January 2014 the Constitutional Court declared admissible a number of complaints relating to the same matter.\\nIn decision no. 3194/2014 (VII.14.) it dismissed these motions on the merits (see below in paragraph 16), noting in particular that the legislature had aimed to eliminate underage smoking and therefore restricted the accessibility of tobacco retail, measures reflecting Hungary’s obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control as well as the findings of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey.'], 'applicants': ['VÉKONY'], 'defendants': ['HUNGARY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-1': ['10', '13', '15', '32', '6', '7', '8']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 5, 8], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 5, 8], 'explained_indices': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 2, 1, 3], 'explained_distances': [-0.086714774, -0.086714774, -0.086714774, -0.086714774, -0.086714774, -0.097565785, -0.12507227, -0.20886365, -0.29051685], 'number_of_sentences': 9, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Turku.', \"8.  On 7 September 1995 the public prosecutor charged the applicant and the managing director of company X before the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) with two counts of aggravated tax fraud and two counts of tax fraud, as they had allegedly produced false invoices to the Turku County Tax Office (lääninverovirasto, länsskatteverket). They were also charged with an accounting offence (count 9), as they had allegedly entered false data in the accounts of X. The prosecutor claimed that the applicant was responsible for the offences together with the managing director as, even though he did not have an official status in the management of the company, he had in fact participated in its management.\\nIn the indictment dated 12 June 1995, count 1, for example, read as follows:\\n“Aggravated tax fraud.\\nOn 23 November 1993 [the managing director] and [the applicant] together, [the former] as the managing director of [company X] and chairman of the board of directors and [the latter] as a person who was de facto responsible for the management of the company, submitted the company's application for a VAT refund in the amount of FIM 342,760 [some EUR 57,000] as regards November 1993 to the County Tax Office of Turku. The application stated that [company Y] had sold electrical relays to [company X] for FIM 1,900,000 [some EUR 319,000] and the latter company had sold the said products further to an Estonian company for FIM 1,680,000 [EUR 282,000]. The invoice relating to the sales transaction between [company X] and [company Y] was fabricated. By submitting such false information which affected the amount of taxes to the authorities for the purposes of taxation, [the managing director] and [the applicant] have attempted to evade taxes.\\nApplicable law: Chapter 29, section 2 of the Penal Code”\\nAs a further example, count 2, which concerned the co-defendant H.A., read as follows:\\n“Aiding and abetting an aggravated tax fraud.\\nBy preparing the invoice in the amount of FIM 1,900,000 referred to in count 1, and by handing it over to [the managing director] and [the applicant] to be attached to the application for a tax refund, [H.A.], on 23 November 1993, intentionally furthered the criminal act committed by [the managing director] and [the applicant].\\nApplicable law: Chapter 29, section 2 and Chapter 5, section 3 (1) of the Penal Code”\", '9.  The applicant pleaded not guilty, arguing that he did not have such a status in company X and therefore could not be held responsible for the alleged offences. Furthermore, he argued that he had not been involved in compiling the documents and that the transactions concerned had not been forged.', \"10.  On 8 February 1996 the District Court found that the business transactions referred to in the relevant invoices were not genuine, that the invoices were false and that the applicant had, together with the managing director, produced false information to the County Tax Office and entered false data in the accounts of X. The District Court referred to the evidence given by the co-accused and the witnesses, finding it proved, inter alia, that the applicant had actually acted in the company in such a position that he was to be held responsible for the offences together with the managing director. Thus, the District Court convicted them both as charged and sentenced them to a suspended term of one year's imprisonment. The co-defendant, H.A., was also convicted as charged.\", \"11.  The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) against his conviction. He maintained that since he had not had any legal or de facto status in X, he had not produced any documents to the County Tax Office and he had not entered false data in X's accounts. Furthermore, the invoices had not been fabricated. He also claimed that the witness evidence was contradictory and that the District Court's assessment of it was erroneous. At the end of his writ of appeal, he stated:\\n“... [C]onsidering that the conduct of [the applicant], on the whole, cannot be considered aggravated, he could not be found guilty of more than aiding and abetting a tax fraud if he were, against all reason, to be found guilty of any offence ...”\", \"12.  The public prosecutor did not submit any written response to the applicant's appeal. In its response to the applicant's appeal the County Tax Office did not refer to a reclassification of the offences as aiding and abetting.\", \"13.  On 13 March 1997 the Court of Appeal held a hearing at which the parties and the witnesses were heard. It appears that there was no discussion as to whether the applicant's alleged conduct could be classified as aiding and abetting the above offences.\", \"14.  In its judgment of 28 August 1997 the Court of Appeal convicted the applicant of two counts of aiding and abetting an aggravated tax fraud and two counts of aiding and abetting a tax fraud and an accounting offence and sentenced him to a term of nine months' suspended imprisonment. The Court of Appeal reasoned inter alia:\\n“[The applicant's] conduct\\nDuring the pre-trial investigation [the managing director] stated that [the applicant] had given instructions to [H.A.] as to the details to be included in the documents that were attached to the applications for a tax refund ... and had also otherwise taken care of matters and the business transactions of [company X].\\n[H.A.] stated during the pre-trial investigation that he had prepared documents to be attached to applications for a tax refund ... in accordance with [the applicant's] and [the managing director's] instructions. According to [H.A.], [the applicant] was in practice responsible for the operation of [company X].\\nWitness [V.M.] stated in the Court of Appeal that he had dealt with the invoice ... together with [the managing director] and [the applicant].\\nIn the light of the statements given by [the managing director] and [H.A.] during the pre-trial investigation, and of the witness statement of [V.M.], which supports those statements, it has been established that [the applicant] participated in the planning of the offences referred to in the indictment and in the preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences.\\nAssessment of [the applicant's] conduct under criminal law\\n... [the applicant] did not have such a position in [company X] as would have made it possible for him to commit, as a principal offender, the offences with which he was charged. When participating in the planning of the offences and in the preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences, however, he contributed to producing false information to the County Tax Office and [on count 9] to entering false data in the accounts. Thus he intentionally furthered the criminal acts of which [the managing director] has been found guilty.”\", '15.  The applicant sought leave to appeal from the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), arguing that he had been convicted of offences differing from those with which he had been charged. He submitted that the public prosecutor had not even claimed that he had been involved in the planning of the offences and compiling the documents. During the proceedings the applicant had not been informed of the nature and cause of these accusations and was thus not given any opportunity to defend himself against them.

The applicant is a Russian national who was born in 1960 and lived before his arrest in Vatazhnoe, a village in the Astrakhan region.', '6.  On or around 22 December 2003 the applicant sold drugs to B. and O.', '7.  On 1 March 2004 B. and O. sold a quantity of those drugs to Su., a police officer taking part in an undercover operation.', '8.  In March 2004 the Voronezh branch of the Federal Drug Control Service (“FSKN”) instituted criminal proceedings against B. and O. When questioned they submitted that they had purchased drugs from the applicant, who lived in Astrakhan.', '9.  On 20 May 2004 the FSKN instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and ordered a “test purchase” from him, to be carried out with the help of B. and two undercover police officers, Sh. and P.', '10.  The covert operation took place between 3 and 5 June 2004 in a hotel in Astrakhan, where Sh. had booked a room. Audio recording devices were installed in the room and the hotel was placed under surveillance. The applicant alleged that during the operation the police had poisoned him with an unknown substance, which had resulted in him being admitted to a prison hospital.', '11.  According to the arrest record drafted at 3.30 p.m. on 5 June 2004, police arrested the applicant in the hallway of the eighth floor of the hotel on the grounds that “witnesses and eyewitnesses indicated that the applicant had committed a criminal offence”. The record also indicated that immediately after his arrest the applicant had been apprised of his right to be assisted by counsel and that he had been searched. The search and its results were described as follows:\\n“... Mr Chukayev was asked to hand over of his own free will any powerful narcotic substances ... he had been keeping on himself unlawfully, money acquired illegally... In reply to the investigator’s request, Mr Chukayev explained that he had none of those things except money, which he had made illegally from selling a narcotic substance, heroin, in a quantity of approximately 38-50 grams. He also explained that the money he had made illegally was in his bag, and submitted that he wished to give it [to the investigator] of his own free will. As a result of the personal search, Mr Chukayev took the money out of his bag voluntarily ...”', '12.  According to the applicant, investigator L. refused to provide him with a lawyer immediately after his arrest on the grounds that no investigating activities were being carried out in respect of him, therefore he did not need a lawyer. The applicant also stated that he had not been questioned on the day of his arrest.', '13.  According to the arrest record, which he had signed, the applicant had made no comments concerning its contents or any other matters, and his wife had been notified of his arrest over the telephone.', '14.  Following the personal search, the investigator seized other money found in his pockets along with his identity papers, mobile phone and some other items. The personal search was photographed.', '15.  On the same day the investigator ordered fingerprint and palm print chemical expert reports. The applicant’s fingerprints and palm prints were taken. The applicant alleged that he had not been informed of the request for these reports or their results. He had only learnt of the expert analyses while reviewing the criminal case file in March 2005.', '16.  On 6 June 2004 the investigator started questioning the applicant as a suspect. According to the interrogation report, lawyer Or. was present during questioning. The applicant alleged that he had refused to give a statement for health reasons, whereas the interrogation report stated that he had invoked his right not to incriminate himself and refused to testify. According to the interrogation report, which he had signed, the applicant had no comments concerning its contents or any other matters.', '17.  On 6 June 2004 the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan (“the District Court”) remanded the applicant in custody. He alleged that counsel Or. had not represented him properly at that hearing. His detention was extended on several subsequent occasions. He remained in detention until his conviction on 14 October 2005.', '18.  On 11 June 2004 the applicant was charged with drug offences and questioned in the presence of counsel I. It is apparent from the record of that interview duly signed by him that he had understood the charges against him and denied all of them. He refused to make a statement.', '19.  On 16 August 2004 new charges were brought against the applicant in the presence of his counsel. He was charged with two counts of drug trafficking, namely unlawfully acquiring, transporting and possessing drugs with intent to sell, and selling drugs to B. and O. in December 2003 and Sh. on 5 June 2004.', '20.  On 17 February 2005 the District Court returned the criminal case to the prosecutor because the applicant had not had sufficient time to review the criminal case file. In March 2005 he finished doing so.', '21.  The trial took place in the District Court between April and October 2005. The applicant was represented by counsel M. and I. The court heard him and several witnesses, and examined the pre-trial statements of absent witnesses as well as physical evidence.\\n(a)  The applicant’s testimony', '22.  The applicant denied all the charges against him. He testified, in particular, that he had met B. in November 2003 and had helped him to buy fish wholesale. On 5 June 2004 they had met because B. had brought some money he had owed him and had wanted to arrange another purchase of fish from him with Sh.\\n(b)  Witness statements in court as to the first set of charges', '23.  During the examination of the first set of charges against the applicant, namely unlawfully acquiring and possessing drugs and selling drugs to B. and O. in December 2003, the District Court heard, and the applicant questioned, O., Av., Le., Sv., Iv. and Yu. as witnesses.\\n(i)  Statements by witness O.', '24.  Witness O. testified that in November 2003 he and B. had gone to Astrakhan from Voronezh and had bought fish from the applicant. Later, the applicant had contacted them and said that he could supply more fish. They had gone to Astrakhan again, where B. had bought drugs from someone. At the end of the investigation of the criminal case against him and B., the police had asked them, in exchange for a more lenient sentence, to go to Astrakhan again and incite the applicant to sell them drugs. He had refused, whereas B. had agreed.', '25.  O.’s testimony in court contradicted his earlier statements made during the pre-trial investigation and the prosecutor asked to have his pre‑trial statement read out in court. The applicant did not object to this request and it was granted.', '26.  It was apparent from O.’s pre-trial statement that he and his business partner B. had been buying fish in Astrakhan and selling it in Voronezh. In November 2003, during their stay in Astrakhan, B. had met the applicant, who had promised to help them purchase some fish. In December 2003 they had again been in Astrakhan, where they had bought heroin from the applicant and transported it to Voronezh.\\n(ii)  Statements by police officers Av., Le., Sv. and attesting witnesses Iv. and Yu.', '27.  Witness Av., a police officer, testified that he had taken part in the planning of the covert operation in June 2004 and had been present at the time of the applicant’s arrest and personal search. He had heard the applicant say at the time of his arrest that he had made money from selling drugs.', '28.  Witnesses Le. and Sv., police officers from the Voronezh police department, submitted that they had taken part in B. and O.’s arrest in March 2004 after they had tried to sell drugs to an undercover police officer.', '29.  Witness Iv. submitted that in March 2004 police had asked him to be an attesting witness during a search of B.’s apartment in Voronezh.', '30.  Witness Yu. submitted that in March 2004 police had asked him to be an attesting witness in the covert operation.\\n(c)  Pre-trial witness statements as to the first set of charges', '31.  The prosecutor submitted two requests to have B. summoned as a witness; however, according to medical documents submitted to the District Court, B. could not attend the hearing because he had a serious oncological condition (cancer) and accompanying speech problems. The District Court then granted the prosecutor’s request, despite the applicant’s objections, to have B.’s pre-trial statement read out and admitted as evidence.', '32.   Witness B. testified in his pre-trial statement that his business partner O. had introduced him to the applicant in November 2003. The applicant had agreed to be an intermediary in his business, which involved supplying fish in Voronezh. On or around 15 December 2003 B. and O. had come to Astrakhan to buy fish. The applicant, however, had not had enough fish for them. B. had serious financial difficulties so O. had suggested buying drugs from the applicant. O. had assured B. that he had an established drug distribution network in Voronezh and that he would help B. to sell drugs within three days to resolve his financial troubles. That had been the first time B. had learnt that the applicant sold drugs. On or around 18 December 2003 the applicant had sold 1.5 kilograms of heroin to B. and O. They had then transported it to Voronezh. The police had arrested them there when they had been trying to sell heroin.', '33.  The District Court also read out and admitted pre-trial statements of five prosecution witnesses as evidence.', '34.  Witness R. testified in his statement that in March 2004 he had organised and supervised the covert operation during which B. and O. had sold drugs to undercover officer Su.', '35.  Witness Su. testified that he had gone undercover to buy drugs from B. and O. during the covert operation in March 2004. He described the manner in which it had been carried out.', '36.   Attesting witnesses M., D. and Z. testified in their statements that in March 2004 the police had asked them to serve as attesting witnesses in the undercover operation, during which they had observed the manner in which the test purchase had been carried out in respect of B. and O.\\n(d)  Witness statements in court as to the second set of charges', '37.  During the examination of the second set of charges against the applicant the District Court questioned three police officers (Sh., K. and Sha.) and two attesting witnesses.', '38.  Witness Sh. submitted that in June 2005 he had taken part in the test purchase from the applicant. B. had identified the applicant as the dealer. During the covert operation he and B. had met the applicant several times in the hotel room. At their last meeting the applicant had sold Sh. about 50 grams of heroin.', '39.  Witness K. testified that he had been responsible for monitoring the undercover operation in respect of the applicant in the summer of 2004.', '40.  Witness Sha. testified that he had arrested the applicant immediately after the test purchase, and that he had said at the time of his arrest that he had made money from selling drugs.', '41.  Witnesses Shi. and Ba. testified that the police had asked them to serve as attesting witnesses in the undercover operation, during which they had observed the manner in which the test purchase had been carried out in respect of the applicant.\\n(e)  Witness pre-trial statements as to the second set of charges', '42.  The District Court also read out a pre-trial statement of absent witness B.', '43.  B. testified that he had agreed to take part in the test purchase from the applicant. A police officer, Sh., had been designated as the buyer. In late May B. had called the applicant to inform him that he had already sold the drugs to a certain person, someone who was interested in buying more drugs from him, but as wished to do so in person he would come to Astrakhan. The applicant had agreed and said that he would arrange the deal.', '44.  B. then described in detail how the covert operation had been carried out between 2 and 5 June 2004. In particular, he had called the applicant several times over those days to arrange a meeting with him. On 3 June 2004 the applicant had come to their hotel and B. had introduced him to Sh., who had asked the applicant to supply him with 2 kilograms of heroin and discussed other terms of the deal. The applicant had said that he could only get 1.2 kilograms of heroin and they had agreed to meet the following day. On 4 June 2004 the applicant had come to their hotel and said that he had contacted the dealers and that they would call him back. They had all stayed in the hotel room until the applicant had received a telephone call. The applicant told them that he would bring the heroin the next day. On 5 June 2004 the applicant had come to their hotel with about 38 grams of heroin. When Sh. had asked him about the remaining amount, the applicant had explained that he could bring more in two days. However, he had 9 grams on him for personal use so Sh. had agreed to buy that too. Sh. had handed money over to the applicant, who had said that he would go downstairs to get change. When he had left the room he had been arrested by the police.\\n(f)  The applicant’s conviction', '45.  On 14 October 2005 the District Court sentenced the applicant to nine years’ imprisonment, after finding him guilty of drug offences, in particular the sale of drugs to B. and O. in December 2003 and Sh. on 5 June 2004. The court admitted the following material as evidence:\\n(i)  the statements made during trial by O., Av., Le., Sv., Iv. and Yu. and the pre-trial statements of B., R., Su., M., D. and Z;\\n(ii)  the statements made during trial by Sh., K., Sha., Shi. and Ba. and the pre-trial statement of B.\\n(iii)  a record of the examination of the banknotes used to buy drugs from the applicant;\\n(iv)  the test purchase record;\\n(v)  the arrest record of 5 June 2004;\\n(vi)  a transcript of the audio recording made in the course of the test purchase;\\n(vii)  forensic chemical examination reports of substances seized at the crime scene;\\n(viii)  a forensic examination report of the applicant’s palm prints.', '46.  The court did not examine the forensic report of the applicant’s fingerprints or admit it as evidence.', '47.  The forensic examination report of the applicant’s palm prints showed that the applicant had had no drug residue on his palms.', '48.  The District Court did not use the applicant’s interrogation report of 6 June 2004 as evidence.', '49.  In his appeal against the conviction the applicant complained, among other things, that the trial court had not ensured the presence of a key prosecution witness, B.', '50.  On 2 March 2006 the Astrakhan Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) upheld the applicant’s conviction. It held that according to medical certificates, B. was suffering from cancer and could not speak. The trial court had therefore lawfully decided that his situation could be considered to be “other exceptional circumstances” which had prevented him from appearing at the hearing, and that his testimony could be read out in accordance with Article 281 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 77 below).', '51.  On an unspecified date in 2006 the applicant applied to the Presidium of the Regional Court for a supervisory review of his conviction.', '52.  On 29 August 2006 it examined the applicant’s case by way of supervisory review. Neither the applicant nor his counsel were present at that hearing. The Presidium amended the judgment of 14 October 2005 as upheld on 2 March 2006 in so far as the applicant’s actions on 5 June 2004 had been classed as a drug offence, and held that his actions should have been classed as an attempt to commit a drug offence. It upheld the remainder of the judgment of 14 October 2005.\\n(b)  Second set of supervisory review proceedings', '53.  On 6 March 2009 a judge of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (“the Supreme Court”) referred the case to the Presidium of the Supreme Court for examination on the merits, at the request of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation.', '54.  On 2 April 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 29 August 2006 by way of supervisory review, on the grounds that the applicant had not been duly informed of the date of the hearing, and had therefore been unable to attend. It remitted the case to the Presidium of the Regional Court for fresh examination.\\n(c)  Third set of supervisory review proceedings', '55.  On 19 May 2009 the applicant requested the Presidium of the Regional Court (“the Presidium”) to provide him with legal aid counsel for the hearing before it. He claimed that he had insufficient means to pay for a lawyer.', '56.  On 2 June 2009 the Presidium examined the criminal case against the applicant by way of supervisory review. He was present at the hearing and was assisted by legal aid counsel K.', '57.  The applicant objected to the panel of the Presidium on the grounds that it had already examined his case by way of supervisory review on 29 August 2006. The Presidium dismissed this objection, finding that the decision of 29 August 2006 had been quashed on procedural grounds. There was therefore no reason to exclude these judges from the new examination of the case.', '58.  The applicant submitted on the merits of the case that at the time of his arrest he had not been informed of his rights or provided with a lawyer and that the record of his arrest had been forged. He also had not received a copy of the arrest record or been able to question key prosecution witness B. at the trial.', '59.  Having examined the case file, the Presidium found that the applicant’s grounds of appeal were unsubstantiated. In particular, it held that the arrest record of 5 June 2004 had been duly authenticated and signed by the applicant, who had been informed of his rights, including the right to be represented by counsel. He did not however request that counsel be instructed or make any comments in the record. The Presidium also noted that statements by prosecution witnesses had been read out at trial in accordance with the law.', '60.  The Presidium amended the judgment of 14 October 2005 as upheld on 2 March 2006, held that the applicant’s actions on 5 June 2004 should have been classed as an attempt to commit a drug offence, and upheld the remainder of the judgment of 14 October 2005.', '61.  By a decision issued on the same day the Presidium ordered the recovery of counsel’s fees in the amount of 1,485.85 Russian roubles (RUB) (about 30 euros (EUR)) from the applicant for the representation in the supervisory review proceedings.', '62.  In the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant was detained in remand prison IZ-30/1 in Astrakhan during the following periods:\\n(a)  between 6 and 9 June 2004;\\n(b)  between 9 July and 16 December 2004;\\n(c)  between 28 December 2004 and 11 April 2006; and\\n(d)  between 27 February and 26 March 2008.', '63.  During the first three periods the applicant was detained in different cells. All of them were overcrowded and infested with insects. They measured about 25 square metres each and contained six bunk beds. He did not have an individual sleeping place and inmates had to take turns to sleep. Some cells were not equipped with ventilation system, while in others it was not working. The electric lighting was always on. The toilet was not separated from the rest of the cells.', '64.  During his last period of detention the applicant was detained in cell 5 located in the basement. He was not provided with any bedding or cooking utensils. Remand prison officers told him that he should have brought his own bedding. The cell was very cold and damp. Since he did not have any bedding he was obliged to sleep in his clothes. The windows were closed all the time and let in no daylight. The cell was never ventilated. The toilet was in the corner of the cell and offered no privacy. The dining table was very close to the toilet. The cell was infested with insects. Detainees could take a fifteen-minute shower once a week.', '65.  On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to correctional colony IK-2 in the Astrakhan region to serve his sentence. It appears that in 2010 he was transferred to correctional colony IK-6, also in the Astrakhan region.', '66.  The applicant submitted that the authorities of IK-2 and IK-6 had opened and read a number of the Court’s letters to him, in particular one dated 13 September 2006 acknowledging receipt of his application and giving him further information on the conduct of the proceedings before the Court, and others dated 21 November 2006, 15 January, 20 February, 22 and 29 May 2007, and 26 February 2008. The applicant provided the Court with copies of these letters. All of them had been stamped by the colony authorities.', '67.  The applicant also submitted that the colony authorities had delayed in sending the Court’s letters to him.', '68.  The Government claimed that during his detention in IK-2 and IK-6 the applicant had sent one letter to the Court and had received 11 letters from the Court.

The applicants are Irish citizens, born in 1958 and 1957, respectively, and they both live in County Wicklow, Ireland.', '10.  On 12 September 1990 they agreed to buy a site with planning permission from “the vendors” on which they intended to build a house. The sale was completed in October 1990. It subsequently emerged that, because of discrepancies in the relevant site maps on which they relied during the sale, they did not have access to the site from the road. They were obliged to discontinue building and to sell the site.', '11.  On 31 May 1991 the Minister for Agriculture and Food established the Tribunal of Enquiry into the Beef Processing Industry (“Beef Tribunal”) and nominated the President of the High Court to be the sole member of the Tribunal. While conducting the Beef Tribunal, the President continued, when possible, to sit in cases in the High Court.', \"12.  On 17 July 1991 the applicants instituted High Court proceedings for negligence, negligent misstatement, breach of contract, misrepresentation and breach of warranty against their own solicitors (“the applicants' solicitors”), the vendors and “the vendors' solicitors”. On 10 March 1992 the High Court ordered discovery on a consent basis. Pursuant to the applicants' motion and the defendants' consent, on 4 May 1992 the High Court ordered the defendants to file their defence within 4 weeks. Further motions of the applicants were struck out on 22 and 24 June and on 19 October 1992. On 18 May 1993 the case was certified ready for hearing by the applicants' senior counsel.\", \"13.  The case was originally listed for hearing on 8 July 1993 but it was adjourned (the applicants objected) due to the illness of one of the defendants to 15 July 1993 when another hearing date would be fixed. On 15 July 1993 a hearing date was fixed for 6 October 1993. On that date there was no judge available and the matter was heard on 7 October 1993 when the President of the High Court (“the trial judge”) made himself available.\\nThe Government maintained that the trial judge was advised by counsel present that the hearing required two days, that the judge had notified the parties that his tribunal commitments meant that he had only two days for their case so that, if the case took longer, he would be obliged to adjourn until after the Beef Tribunal, that he would only deal with issues of liability and that the applicants agreed to this. The applicants denied that their counsel so advised the trial judge, that the trial judge had informed them that the trial would be so adjourned, that their counsel would have agreed to an indefinite adjournment (given the second applicant's psychological state) or that they agreed to the separation of issues of liability and damages.\", \"14.  The applicants' case was heard on 7 and 8 October 1993 and, since it was unfinished, the trial judge adjourned it. On 2 November 1993 and 8 February 1994 the applicants wrote to the Chief Registrar of the High Court asking for enquiries to be made as to when the action would be resumed. On 16 March 1994 they wrote to the Registrar asking him to intervene with the trial judge to fix a date and enclosing a medical report of the second applicant's doctor dated 12 March 1994 (see paragraph 32 below). The Registrar was also contacted by telephone on numerous occasions by the applicants regarding a hearing date. In March 1994 the Registrar informed the applicants by telephone that the trial judge had confirmed a hearing date in July 1994. A letter to the Registrar of 9 June 1994 requested that a hearing date be fixed.\", \"15.  During this period, the applicants wrote also wrote to, inter alia, numerous members of Dáil Eireann (the House of Representatives) including to the Minister for Justice. The Deputy Chair of Dáil Eireann indicated, in a letter dated 25 March 1994, that he had contacted the Acting President of the High Court asking the latter to intercede on the applicants' behalf. On 7 April 1994 the Acting President responded that the case would be taken in July 1994.\", \"16.  On 29 July 1994 the trial judge completed his report on the Beef Tribunal. On 19 September 1994 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The trial judge resumed the hearing of the applicants' case on 5 October 1994. He heard the last two witnesses and requested legal argument in writing. He reserved judgment, indicating that he would deliver it approximately one week after receipt of the written submissions. Those submissions were made by the end of October 1994\", \"17.  On 29 November 1994, 2 February, 12 April and 22 May 1995 the applicants wrote to certain Registrars of the High Court requesting information as to when the judgment would be delivered. A response, dated 26 May 1995, stated that the trial judge could not confirm when he could deliver his judgment given his heavy commitments. Further to the applicants' letter, the Minister for Justice indicated in a letter of 10 July 1995 that, while she could not intervene, she had brought the matter to the attention of a Registrar of the High Court. The applicants also wrote to a Registrar on 12 July 1995 again requesting an early delivery date. A Registrar's letter of 13 July 1995 indicated a delivery date before the end of the month. By letter dated 25 July 1995 the Minister for Justice responded to a further letter from the applicants indicating that she had forwarded a copy of the applicants' correspondence to the trial judge. Further to another letter from the applicants, a Registrar subsequently confirmed delivery of the judgment on 12 September 1995.\", \"18.  Judgment was orally delivered on that date. Both the vendors and the applicants' solicitors were found liable in damages and the claim against the vendors' solicitors was dismissed. On 21 September 1995 the Court made various orders concerning damages (adjournment of the assessment of damages) and costs to be paid by the unsuccessful parties. Pending finalisation by the trial judge of the written judgment, the form of order was not to be perfected in order to allow the applicants time to consider the text of that judgment prior to the expiration of the time-limit for appealing any orders of the High Court. The applicants wrote two letters to a Registrar of the High Court (dated 6 and 13 October 1995) and the text of the judgment became available in mid-October 1995. The order of the High Court was perfected on 17 October 1995 and on 3 November 1995 the applicants appealed the findings in favour of the vendors' solicitors to the Supreme Court. The vendors also appealed the High Court findings against them.\", \"19.  Since a stenographer had not been present during the High Court hearings, it was necessary to prepare and agree a record of the evidence given during those hearings for the purposes of the appeal. By 9 February 1996 the applicants had completed a substantial note of evidence and on 29 March 1996 they submitted it to the vendors and to the vendors' solicitors for their agreement. On 17 July 1996 the applicants issued two motions. The first sought the comments of the vendors' solicitors on the note of evidence and the second requested that the vendors' appeal be struck out for “want of prosecution” since the vendors had not filed documents in their appeal.\", \"20.  On 26 July 1996 the Supreme Court heard both motions with the trial judge (then Chief Justice) presiding. The court requested the vendors and the vendors' solicitors to submit their comments on the note of evidence within two weeks, in default of which the trial judge would finalise the note. On the second motion, the vendors were given until 7 October 1996 to file the relevant appeal documents, in default of which the Supreme Court envisaged striking out the vendors' appeal. Both motions were adjourned until 11 October 1996. The vendors' appeal and the related motion were later dropped.\", \"21.  Following further letters from the applicants in August 1996, on 17 September 1996 the vendors' solicitors indicated that they disagreed with 16 items in the note of evidence. On 11 October 1996 the applicants' motion concerning the note of evidence was adjourned to 18 October 1996. Three days later the vendors' solicitors confirmed that agreement would not be reached on the note. On 18 October 1996 three judges of the Supreme Court (not including the trial judge) directed the trial judge to settle the note of evidence. On 24 October 1996 the applicants submitted the note of evidence together with a note of the 16 disputed points to the trial judge.\", '22.  In or around November 1996 the President of the High Court gave directions that all complaints about delays in proceedings should be forwarded to him. A memorandum of the President of the High Court published in the Bar Review of January/February 1997 noted the delays in delivering reserved judgments due to the shortage of judges and requested legal practitioners formally to notify the President of the High Court of their concerns about such delays.', \"23.  Subsequently, the applicants wrote to a Registrar of the High Court on a number of occasions (including on 14 January, 12 March and 25 June 1997) requesting the early settlement of the note of evidence. On 8 July 1997 the applicants wrote to the President of the High Court requesting him to intervene given the delay in their proceedings. In July 1997 a Registrar of the High Court indicated orally that the trial judge would deal with the matter after 20 August 1997. The applicants sent a further reminder to that Registrar on 18 September 1997. On 10 October 1997 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (“the Department of Justice”) requested the Chief Registrar's comments on the alleged undue delay in the case. On 16 October 1997 a Registrar indicated to the Department of Justice that the note of evidence matter would be resolved in one week.\", '24.  By letter dated 22 October 1997 the trial judge forwarded a report (six pages) he had prepared on the evidence and on the points disputed by the relevant parties and he apologised to the applicants for the delay. By letter dated 24 October 1997 a Registrar assured the Department of Justice that the note of evidence matter had been resolved and that an early date for a hearing of the appeal would be made available.', \"25.  Further to the applicants' complaints to their member of Dáil Eireann and to the Tánaiste (the deputy Prime Minister), the Attorney General expressed, by letter dated 30 October 1997 to the applicants, his concern at the delay in their case. While he was constitutionally obliged not to interfere in judicial matters, he had mentioned the matter informally to the trial judge and the latter assured him that all outstanding matters had been dealt with. In a letter dated 4 November 1997 the Attorney General confirmed to the Tánaiste that he was concerned about the delays which the applicants had experienced in their case and that he had raised these matters in a private and informal manner with the trial judge who had assured him that all outstanding matters had been dealt with. Following an invitation, the applicants met with a member of the Attorney General's Office in late November 1997, although the advice was that that office could not interfere in judicial processes.\", \"26.  By motion dated 9 December 1997 the applicants amended their appeal. By letter dated 21 January 1998 the Minister for Justice responded to queries of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) concerning the applicant's case pointing out that on 21 November 1997 the appeal hearing had been fixed for 2 February 1998.\", \"27.  The Supreme Court delivered its reserved judgment on the applicants' appeal on 9 March 1998 and found in the applicants' favour, considering that the vendors' solicitors were also liable in negligence to the applicants.\", \"28.  The case was remitted to the High Court for the assessment and apportionment of damages. By letter dated 7 May 1998 the Attorney General responded to queries raised by the applicants' member of Dáil Eireann: he indicated that their case was “concerning” and that it was hoped that the recently established system for monitoring judicial delays would ensure that their experience would not be repeated.\", \"29.  The vendors' solicitors filed an amended defence in May 1998 and the applicants filed further particulars of damage in June 1998. On 26 June 1998 the vendors' solicitors made a late lodgement into court in the sum of 85,000 Irish pounds (IR£). The applicants objected. A letter dated 13 July 1998 from the Attorney General's office to the applicants explained that his previous intervention related to an administrative act by the trial judge (the note of evidence) but that the outstanding matters were judicial in which he could not interfere. By letter dated 22 July 1998 the Attorney General's office confirmed that it had been informed that a hearing date had been fixed by the High Court for 13 October 1998. A letter dated 6 August 1998 from the Taoiseach's office to the applicants confirmed that increased resources to the courts meant that it was hoped that their experiences would not be repeated. On 9 October 1998 the applicants also met with the Tánaiste to discuss the length of their ongoing proceedings.\", \"30.  On 13-16 October 1998 an assessment hearing took place in the High Court. On 25 November 1998 the High Court awarded the applicants approximately IR£200,000 in respect of pecuniary loss and IR£10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (the High Court finding that both applicants had been put through “a high degree of anxiety and upset” as a consequence of the defendants' negligence). The applicants were also awarded their costs when taxed and ascertained. On 11 December 1998 the High Court dealt with matters concerning the attribution of liability between the defendants. The order of the High Court was perfected in early February 1999. There was no appeal on these matters to the Supreme Court.\", \"31.  The Taxing Master abridged the time for service of the applicants' bill of costs (Order 99, Rule 28(1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts) and fixed a hearing for 29 July 1999. The bill of costs contained 519 items and comprised 172 pages. This hearing was then adjourned on the application of the vendors' solicitors until 20 October 1999. The hearing took place on that date and, since it did not finish, it was adjourned to and continued on 20 November 1999. It was again adjourned and concluded on 22 November 1999, when the Taxing Master delivered his reserved ruling. The Certificate on Taxation (approximately IR£300,000) was signed by the Taxing Master on 15 December 1999.\", \"32.  The applicants submitted a number of medical certificates to the Court.\\nA certificate prepared by the second applicant's doctor on 26 May 1993 attested to her severe symptoms of anxiety since the legal problems had arisen. She had required repeated courses of medication and she was, at that stage, depressed and on medication. Her anxiety symptoms were likely to continue until the legal situation was resolved. The same doctor confirmed, in a certificate dated 12 March 1994, a deterioration of the second applicant's condition into “frank depression”. Medication had initially helped but the delay in the proceedings was worsening her condition. A psychiatric report on the second applicant dated July 1998 recorded her significant clinical depression since the start of the proceedings which warranted anti-depressants and tranquillisers on many occasions. It was considered that the proceedings continually threatened to bring about a relapse, in spite of certain periods of recovery following appropriate treatment. It was also considered that a full recovery was foreseeable only after the proceedings terminated. A psychiatric report on the first applicant dated August 1998 attested to the great strain the proceedings had caused him.\"], 'applicants': ['DORAN'], 'defendants': ['IRELAND'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['13', '14', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24'], '13': ['57']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'explained_indices': [3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 11, 12, 22, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 13, 23], 'explained_distances': [0.38841754, 0.099852085, 0.013505399, 0.009361625, 0.0039402843, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143, -0.0004863143], 'number_of_sentences': 24, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1979 and is currently detained in the Ankara Prison', '5.  On 23 May 1999 at about 3 p.m. the applicant, who was working for a newspaper called Kurtuluş, was taken into police custody in the district of Almus in the province of Tokat by police officers on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front). At about 5 p.m. she was taken to the Almus State Hospital, where a medical report was issued. In the report, the presence of a 0.5 x 1 cm. abrasion under the right eye was noted. It was stated that this abrasion had probably been caused as a result of an irritation. The medical report further indicated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on her body.', '6.  On the same day, the applicant was transferred to the province of Tokat to be interrogated by the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Tokat Security Directorate. Before being taken to the Security Directorate Building, at about 7.45 p.m. the applicant was sent to the Tokat State Hospital for a medical examination. The medical report indicated the presence of a hyperaemia under the right eye and an abrasion on the right side of the nose. Thereafter at about 8.10 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological examination with a request to establish her virginity status. As she did not give her consent, the applicant did not undergo a gynaecological examination. At 9 p.m. the applicant was taken once again to the Tokat State Hospital, this time for a rectal examination. As the applicant refused to be examined, no rectal examination was performed.', '7.  On 30 May 1999 before being released from custody, the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological and rectal examination. As she did not give her consent, the doctors did not perform the examinations. Subsequently, she was taken to the Tokat State Hospital, where she was examined by a doctor. According to the doctor’s report, no signs of ill-treatment were observed on the applicant’s body.', '8.  On 30 May 1999 the applicant was brought before the Tokat public prosecutor. Before the public prosecutor, she denied the allegations against her and maintained that her police statement, dated 29 May 1999, had been taken under duress. She stated that she had been hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and Palestinian hanging.', '9.  The same day the applicant was further brought before the investigating judge at the Tokat Magistrate’s Court where she repeated her statement taken by the prosecutor. The investigating judge decided to place her in detention on remand on account of the evidence in the file and the nature of the offences against her.', '10.  On 31 May 1999 the Tokat public prosecutor declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court.', '11.  In an indictment dated 15 June 1999, the Ankara State Security Court Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and accused her of being a member of an illegal organisation.', '12.  On 12 August 1999 the applicant sent a letter to the court and retracted her statement made to the police, alleging that it was taken under duress. In this letter, she explained in detail the various forms of ill-treatments she had been allegedly subjected to in custody. In particular, she maintained that during her police custody she had been stripped naked, threatened with rape, beaten, hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and hung from her arms.', '13.  On 11 July 2000 the Ankara State Security Court found that the applicant had been continuously working for the said illegal organisation. It therefore found the applicant guilty as charged under Article 168 of the Criminal Code and sentenced her to twelve years six months’ imprisonment.', '14.  On 4 April 2001 the applicant submitted her appeal petition to the Court of Cassation. While challenging the decision of the first-instance court, she particularly referred to her ill-treatment under custody. She also stated that she had been taken to the hospital on two occasions during her police custody to undergo a gynaecological examination. She alleged that this treatment constituted degrading treatment.', '15.  On 25 April 2001 the Court of Cassation, upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s reasoning and assessment of evidence, rejected the applicant’s appeal.'], 'applicants': ['DEVRİM TURAN'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['5', '6', '7'], '13': ['12', '14', '8', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10], 'explained_indices': [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 2, 0, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.09373322, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.051481158, 0.015161186, -0.043615848, -0.05927244], 'number_of_sentences': 12, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants, who are the elder daughter of the late Prince Rainier III of Monaco and her husband, were born in 1957 and 1954 respectively and live in Monaco.', '11.  Since the early 1990s the first applicant has been trying – often through the courts – to prevent the publication of photos about her private life in the press.', '12.  Two series of photos, published in 1993 and 1997 respectively in three German magazines and showing the first applicant with the actor Vincent Lindon or her husband, had been the subject of three sets of proceedings in the German courts and, in particular, leading judgments of the Federal Court of Justice of 19 December 1995 and of the Federal Constitutional Court of 15 December 1999 dismissing the first applicant’s claims.', '13.  Those proceedings were the subject of the Von Hannover v. Germany judgment of 24 June 2004 (no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004‑VI) in which the Court held that the court decisions had infringed the first applicant’s right to respect for her private life, a right guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.', '14.  Regarding the reasoning of the domestic courts, the Court made the following findings in particular:\\n“72.  The Court finds it hard to agree with the domestic courts’ interpretation of section 23(1) of the Copyright (Arts Domain) Act, which consists in describing a person as such as a figure of contemporary society ‘par excellence’. Since that definition affords the person very limited protection of their private life or the right to control the use of their image, it could conceivably be appropriate for politicians exercising official functions. However, it cannot be justified for a ‘private’ individual, such as the applicant, in whom the interest of the general public and the press is based solely on her membership of a reigning family, whereas she herself does not exercise any official functions.\\nIn any event the Court considers that, in these conditions, the Act has to be interpreted narrowly to ensure that the State complies with its positive obligation under the Convention to protect private life and the right to control the use of one’s image. 73.  Lastly, the distinction drawn between figures of contemporary society ‘par excellence’ and ‘relatively’ public figures has to be clear and obvious so that, in a State governed by the rule of law, the individual has precise indications as to the behaviour he or she should adopt. Above all, they need to know exactly when and where they are in a protected sphere or, on the contrary, in a sphere in which they must expect interference from others, especially the tabloid press. 74.  The Court therefore considers that the criteria on which the domestic courts based their decisions were not sufficient to protect the applicant’s private life effectively. As a figure of contemporary society ‘par excellence’ she cannot – in the name of freedom of the press and the public interest – rely on protection of her private life unless she is in a secluded place out of the public eye and, moreover, succeeds in proving it (which can be difficult). Where that is not the case, she has to accept that she might be photographed at almost any time, systematically, and that the photos are then very widely disseminated even if, as was the case here, the photos and accompanying articles relate exclusively to details of her private life. 75.  In the Court’s view, the criterion of spatial isolation, although apposite in theory, is in reality too vague and difficult for the person concerned to determine in advance. In the present case, merely classifying the applicant as a figure of contemporary society ‘par excellence’ does not suffice to justify such an intrusion into her private life.”', '15.  Relying on the Court’s judgment in the first applicant’s case, the applicants subsequently brought several sets of proceedings in the civil courts seeking an injunction against any further publication of photos that had appeared in German magazines.', '16.  The first three photos were published by the publishing company Ehrlich & Sohn GmbH & Co. KG in the magazine Frau im Spiegel.\\n(a)  The first photo', '17.  The first photo, which appeared in issue no. 9/02 of 20 February 2002, shows the applicants out for a walk during their skiing holiday in St Moritz. It is accompanied by an article with the heading: “Prince Rainier – not home alone” (“Fürst Rainier – Nicht allein zu Haus”). The article reads as follows.\\n“The first magnolia buds are flowering in the grounds of Monaco Palace – but Prince Rainier (78) appears to have no interest in the burgeoning spring. He goes for a walk outside with his daughter Stéphanie (37). She supports him as he walks along slowly. He is cold despite the sunshine. The old gentleman is weary. The Monegasques saw their prince for the last time three weeks ago at a circus festival. He had appeared bright and cheerful, walking along beside his daughter who was laughing. But since then he has not left the palace. Not even for the St Devota celebration held in honour of the national Patron Saint. The Principality is worried, as are Prince Rainier’s children. Prince Albert (who is currently taking part in the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City), Princess Caroline (on holiday in St Moritz with Prince Ernst August von Hannover) and Princess Stéphanie take it in turns to look after their father. He must not be left home alone when he is not well. Not without his children’s love.”\\nA photo of Prince Rainier with his daughter Princess Stéphanie and a photo of Prince Albert of Monaco taken during the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City appeared on the same page.\\n(b)  The second photo', '18.  The second photo, which appeared in issue no. 9/03 of 20 February 2003, shows the applicants out for a walk in St Moritz. The caption says: “Ernst August von Hannover and his wife, Princess Caroline of Monaco, enjoy the sun and snow in St Moritz.” A small photo of Prince Albert and two photos of members of a European royal family appeared on the same page. The article accompanying the photos, bearing the heading “Royal fun in the snow”, is about how happy the persons photographed are to meet up in St Moritz.\\n(c)  The third photo', '19.  The third photo, which appeared in issue no. 12/04 of 11 March 2004, shows the applicants in a chair lift in Zürs am Arlberg during their skiing holiday. On the same page there is a small photo of Prince Rainier, the first applicant and Prince Albert, taken during the national holiday on 19 November and bearing the heading “The princess’s last appearance”. Another photo, taking up half the page, shows the first applicant at the Rose Ball.\\nThe three photos illustrate an article bearing the heading “Princess Caroline. The whole of Monaco awaits her”, of which the passages relevant to the present case read as follows.\\n“Tickets for the Rose Ball, which will be held on 20 March in Monaco, have been selling for weeks. And the guests will be coming only for her: Princess Caroline von Hannover (47). She has not attended any official engagements since the national holiday ... She was not at the circus festival or the St Devota celebration held in honour of the patron saint of Monaco. By tradition, the eldest daughter of Prince Rainier (80) opens the annual ball. She has inherited this role from her mother, who died in an accident, and this ball is Caroline’s favourite ... The prince, who is seriously ill, has just come out of hospital after a heart operation and is still too weak to attend the ball. The welcome speech which he will be making in honour of the guests will be retransmitted via television cameras and projected onto a big screen. Princess Caroline and her husband [Prince] Ernst August von Hannover will open the Rose Ball with a waltz.\\nThey celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary together in January. And there was more cause for celebration in the von Hannover household: the prince turned 50 on 26 February. He celebrated his birthday with Caroline and some friends at the fashionable resort of St Moritz, glistening white in the snow. The couple were actually spending their holiday in Zürs am Arlberg, but for the birthday party they went down to the Palace Hotel in St Moritz for a few days.”', '20.  The publishing company WZV Westdeutsche Zeitschriftenverlag GmbH & Co. KG published in issue no. 9/02 of 20 February 2002 of the magazine Frau Aktuell the same photo (or a virtually identical one) as the one that had appeared the same day in the magazine Frau im Spiegel no. 9/02 (see paragraph 17 above). The article accompanying the photo in Frau Aktuell bears the heading: “That is genuine love. Princess Stéphanie. She is the only one looking after the sick prince.” The relevant passages of the article are worded as follows.\\n“Her love life may appear unbridled. One thing is certain, though: as far as her father is concerned, Princess Stéphanie knows where her heart lies. While the rest of the family are travelling around the world, she has run to be at the side of Prince Rainier (78), who appears to be seriously ailing. She is the only one who takes care of the sick monarch. Stéphanie’s sister, Caroline (45), has taken a few days’ holiday with her husband Ernst August (48) and their daughter Alexandra (2) at the fashionable St Moritz ski resort in Switzerland. Prince Albert, for his part, has been at the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City taking part in the four-man bobsleigh race. ‘For the fifth and last time,’ he said. From time to time he would disappear for a number of days. It is said that the prince has seen his heart-throb, Alicia Warlick (24), an American pole vaulter who is rumoured to become his future wife. [Prince Rainier], who hates being alone now, was very glad to see his younger daughter. Stéphanie has devoted a lot of time to him. She has been out on long walks with him and they have greatly confided in each other. ‘Rainier has relished the company of his younger daughter. When she is at his side he truly flourishes. During those moments he forgets that he is old and sick,’ say the Monegasques. ‘Stéphanie should come much more often.’”\\nOn the same page there is the photo of Princess Stéphanie with her father that had appeared the same day in the magazine Frau im Spiegel no. 9/02 (see paragraph 17 above), a headshot of her and two other photos, one of Prince Albert alone and the other of the prince with Alicia Warlick. 1.  The proceedings instituted by the first applicant\\n(a)  The first set of proceedings\\n(i)  Judgment of the Regional Court of 29 April 2005', '21.  On an unspecified date in 2004, the first applicant sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court against any further publication of the three photos by the Ehrlich & Sohn publishing company.', '22.  In a judgment of 29 April 2005, the Regional Court granted the injunction on the ground that the first applicant had not consented to publication of the photos, which was a precondition under section 22 of the Copyright (Arts Domain) Act (hereafter “the Copyright Act” – see paragraph 70 below). The court stated, however, that even if consent were deemed unnecessary in the case of the first photo on the ground that it was an image from contemporary society (Bildnis aus dem Bereich der Zeitgeschichte) within the meaning of section 23(1)(1) of the same Act, publication of the photo was not justified. Under subsection 2 of that provision, publication of such an image was only lawful if it did not interfere with a legitimate interest of the person photographed. According to the court, the question as to whether there was such a legitimate interest had to be determined by balancing the interests of the person photographed against those of the public in being informed.', '23.  The Regional Court found that in the present case it was the first applicant’s right to the protection of her personality rights that prevailed. In reaching that conclusion the Regional Court referred extensively to the Court’s judgment in Von Hannover. It found that the first applicant’s relationship with her father, regardless of the fact that he was ill, did not contribute to a debate of general interest to society especially as the first applicant was connected to the prince of a State of minor importance in international politics merely through a family tie and did not exercise any official function.', '24.  The Regional Court stated that, whilst that reasoning was not entirely in keeping with the principles established by the Federal Constitutional Court, which did not recognise a legitimate interest unless the person photographed had retired to a secluded place away from the public eye, it was not bound by that precedent to the extent that it could not take into consideration the Court’s case-law on the subject.\\n(ii)  Judgment of the Court of Appeal of 31 January 2006', '25.  The publishing company appealed against that judgment.', '26.  In a judgment of 31 January 2006, the Hamburg Court of Appeal set aside the judgment on the ground that the applicant’s right under Article 8 of the Convention had to yield to the fundamental rights of the press. It found that, whilst the articles were primarily of entertainment value, publication of the photos was nonetheless lawful in terms of the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 15 December 1999 whose main legal reasoning (tragende Erwägungen) was binding on the Court of Appeal. It pointed out that public figures should certainly be protected from the risk of being photographed at any time and anywhere and seeing the photos subsequently published. However, in the Court of Appeal’s opinion, the legitimate interest of such figures, within the meaning of section 23(2) of the Copyright Act, should not result in the prohibition of any reporting on well‑known people outside their official appearances. In any event, the right to respect for private life did not require the banning of publication of photos taken in public places accessible to all and where the individual concerned was amongst many other people.\\n(iii)  Judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 6 March 2007', '27.  The first applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment.', '28.  In a judgment of 6 March 2007 (no. VI ZR 51/06), the Federal Court of Justice dismissed her appeal in respect of the first photo. With regard to the second and third photos, it upheld her appeal, quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and reinstated the injunction imposed by the Regional Court.', '29.  The Federal Court of Justice found that the opinion of the Court of Appeal did not correspond to the concept of graduated protection (abgestuftes Schutzkonzept) that had been developed in the case-law on the basis of sections 22 and 23 of the Copyright Act and which it had clarified in a number of recent decisions delivered following the Von Hannover judgment and in response to the reservations of principle which the Court had expressed in that judgment. According to that new concept of protection, section 23(1) of the Copyright Act, which provided for an exception to the rule according to which a photo could not be published without the prior consent of the person concerned, took account of the public’s interest in being informed and of the freedom of the press. Accordingly, when assessing whether or not the impugned publication portrayed an aspect of contemporary society within the meaning of section 23(1)(1) of the Copyright Act, a balancing exercise had to be undertaken between the rights under Articles 1 § 1 and 2 § 1 of the Basic Law and Article 8 of the Convention on the one hand, and those under Article 5 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law and Article 10 of the Convention on the other hand.', '30.  The Federal Court of Justice added that the Court’s criticism of the expression “figure of contemporary society par excellence” ultimately concerned the determination of the conditions in which the media could report on well-known people such as these. It considered that, irrespective of the issue whether the first applicant should be regarded as a figure of contemporary society par excellence, she was in any case a well-known person who particularly attracted public attention. In the court’s view, that fact, combined with the fact that she had not been in a secluded place out of the public eye when the photos had been taken, was nonetheless insufficient to deprive her of protection of her private sphere. That conclusion was not only appropriate in the light of the Court’s ruling but also reflected a proper understanding of the concept of protection thus developed.', '31.  Accordingly, the Federal Court of Justice found that the publication of images of persons who – on account of their importance in contemporary society – were in theory required, under section 23(1)(1) of the Copyright Act, to tolerate the publication of photos of themselves was nevertheless unlawful if the legitimate interests of the person concerned were infringed (section 23(2)). There could be no exception to the obligation to obtain the consent of the person in question unless the report in question concerned an important event of contemporary society. The expression “contemporary society” – and indeed the term “information value” – had to be interpreted in a broad sense and according to whether there was a public interest. It comprised any matter of general interest to society and included reports for entertainment purposes, which could also play a role in the formation of opinions, or even stimulate or influence these to a greater degree than purely factual information.', '32.  Whilst the freedom of the press and the prohibition of censorship required the press to be able to decide for itself which subjects it intended to report on and what it intended to publish, the press was not exempt from the duty to weigh its interest in publishing the information against the protection of the privacy of the person concerned. The greater the information value for the general public, the more the right to protection had to yield. Conversely, where the interest in informing the public decreased, the importance of protecting the person concerned carried correspondingly greater weight. The reader’s interest in being entertained generally carried less weight than that of protecting privacy, in which case the reader’s interest did not merit protection.', '33.  The Federal Court of Justice stated that, accordingly, even where persons who had hitherto been regarded as figures of contemporary society were concerned, consideration must be given to the question whether the report contributed to a factual debate (mit Sachgehalt) and whether the content went beyond a mere intention to satisfy public curiosity. In determining that question, there was nothing to prevent regard being had to how well the person concerned was known to the public.', '34.  The Federal Court of Justice stressed that that manner of balancing the various interests at stake corresponded to the requirements of the Court regarding effective protection of the private sphere and the requirements of the freedom of the press, and that it did not conflict with the binding force of the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 15 December 1999. Admittedly, that court had limited the protection afforded to the private sphere against the publication of unwanted photos to cases of spatial seclusion. That did not, however, prevent the courts – when balancing the various interests – from having more regard to the value of the information for the public. Furthermore, the Federal Constitutional Court had [recently] endorsed the balancing exercise undertaken by the Federal Court of Justice according to those criteria in a judgment concerning the second applicant (decision of 13 June 2006, no. 1 BvR 565/06).', '35.  The Federal Court of Justice specified that as the determining criterion for the balancing exercise was the information value of the photo in question and as it had been published in the context of a written article, the content of the text accompanying the photo could not be ignored.', '36.  Applying the criteria thus established to the case submitted to it, the Federal Court of Justice, beginning with the second and third photos, observed that the second photo showed the applicants in a busy street in St Moritz during their skiing holiday. Whilst the press could, as a matter of principle, make its own decision regarding the content of its publications and the applicants had indeed been in a public place amongst other people, neither the article nor the photo related to an event of general interest or contemporary society. A celebrity’s holidays fell within the core area (Kernbereich) of his or her private sphere. The publication of the article and photo had been for entertainment purposes only and was not in any way relevant to matters of public interest, so could only be done with the first applicant’s consent.', '37.  The Federal Court of Justice noted that the third photo showed the applicants in a chair lift in Zürs during their skiing holiday. Whilst the Rose Ball shortly to be held in Monaco, which was the subject of the article accompanying the photo, could possibly be regarded as an event of contemporary society that was a matter of general interest to society, there was no link between the photo and that event. The purpose of the photo had been to supplement the part of the article about the second applicant’s birthday party in St Moritz and the applicants’ skiing holiday in Zürs. Thus the information centred exclusively on the first applicant’s private life and served merely entertainment purposes. Accordingly, the third photo could not be published without the first applicant’s consent either.', '38.  Regarding the first photo, the Federal Court of Justice observed that whilst it contained no information having any connection with an event of contemporary society or contributing to a debate of general interest, the same was not true of the accompanying text. Admittedly, the part about the first applicant’s skiing holiday did not concern an event of contemporary society or general interest, even interpreting those terms broadly. However, with regard to the prince’s health, the Federal Court of Justice found as follows:\\n“The information also concerned the ill-health of the reigning Prince of Monaco. His ill-health was thus an event of contemporary society on which the press was entitled to report. The journalistic quality and the conception of the article are not decisive because the principle of the freedom of the press does not allow the applicability of a fundamental right to depend upon the quality of the press coverage or how the article is drafted. This also applies to the comments in the article on the conduct of members of the family during the prince’s illness, and, moreover, the applicant has not complained about the article in that respect. The photo in question supports and illustrates the information being conveyed.”', '39.  The Federal Court of Justice concluded that, in those circumstances and having regard to the context of the report as a whole, the first applicant had no legitimate interest that could have opposed publication of the photo of the applicants out in the street. There had, in particular, been nothing about the photo itself that constituted a violation (eigenständiger Verletzungseffekt) and thus justified a different conclusion; nor was there anything to suggest that the photo had been taken surreptitiously or by using secret technical devices that rendered its publication unlawful.\\n(iv)  Judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 26 February 2008', '40.  In a judgment of 26 February 2008, the First Division (Senat) of the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed constitutional appeals lodged by the first applicant (no. 1 BvR 1626/07) and by the Ehrlich & Sohn GmbH & Co. KG publishing company (no. 1 BvR 1602/07) against the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice (no. VI ZR 51/06).\\nIn the same judgment it allowed a constitutional appeal (no. 1 BvR 1606/07) lodged by the Klambt-Verlag GmbH & Co. publishing company against an injunction, imposed by the Federal Court of Justice (judgment of 6 March 2007, no. VI ZR 52/06), on any further publication of a photo that had appeared in 7 Tage magazine showing the applicants on holiday in an unspecified location and accompanying a written and photographic report on the possibility of renting a holiday villa owned by the von Hannover family in Kenya. Those proceedings are the subject of a separate application by the first applicant to the Court (no. 8772/10).', '41.  The Federal Constitutional Court observed, firstly, that the court decisions constituted an interference with the first applicant’s right to the protection of her personality rights guaranteed by Articles 1 § 1 and 2 § 1 of the Basic Law. There were limits on the protection afforded to that right and on the freedom of the press, however. The freedom of the press was subject to the restrictions laid down in sections 22 et seq. of the Copyright Act and Article 8 of the Convention, whilst the provisions of the Copyright Act and Article 10 of the Convention limited the right to the protection of personality rights. In the German legal order the Convention had the status of an ordinary federal law. At constitutional-law level, the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and the Court’s case-law served as guides to interpretation when determining the content and scope of a fundamental right.', '42.  The Federal Constitutional Court reiterated the case-law of the Court regarding Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention and its own case-law on the different fundamental rights at stake by referring to the principles established in its leading judgment of 15 December 1999 (Von Hannover, cited above, § 25). It added that in so far as an image did not itself make any contribution to the formation of public opinion, its information value had to be assessed in the context of the accompanying article. However, if that article was merely a pretext for publishing a photo of a well-known person, no contribution was made to the formation of public opinion and there were therefore no grounds for allowing the interest in publication to prevail over the protection of personality rights.', '43.  The Federal Constitutional Court went on to say that, in order to determine the weight to be attached to the protection of personality rights, regard had to be had not only to the circumstances in which the photo had been taken, for example whether it had been taken surreptitiously or as a result of persistent hounding by photographers, but also to the situation in which the person concerned had been photographed and how he or she was portrayed. The right to protection of personality rights thus carried more weight where the photo showed details of the person’s private life that were not normally the subject of public discussion. The same was true where the person concerned could legitimately expect, having regard to the circumstances, that no photo would be published because he or she was in a private place (räumliche Privatheit), such as in a specially protected location. The right to protection of personality rights could also prevail over the interest in publication in cases other than those of spatial isolation, notably where the person concerned was pictured enjoying a moment of relaxation or letting go, freed from the constraints of professional or everyday life.', '44.  The Federal Constitutional Court stated that importance had to be attached in that connection to the allocation of procedural obligations regarding the presentation of the facts and the burden of proof. It had to be ensured that neither the press nor the person being photographed was prevented from adducing proof of circumstances relevant for the balancing of the competing interests. Where the press intended to publish a photo without the consent of the person concerned, it could be required to substantiate the circumstances in which the photo had been taken in order to allow the courts to examine the question whether publication of the photo could be opposed on grounds of the legitimate expectations of the person photographed.', '45.  The Federal Constitutional Court observed that it was the task of the civil courts to apply and interpret the provisions of civil law in the light of the fundamental rights at stake while having regard to the Convention. It added that its own role was limited to examining whether the lower courts had had sufficient regard to the impact of fundamental rights when interpreting and applying the law and when balancing the competing rights. Such was also the scope of the scrutiny of the Constitutional Court regarding the question whether the courts had fulfilled their obligation to incorporate the Court’s relevant case-law into the national legal order (Teilrechtsordnung). The fact that the court’s balancing exercise of the various rights in multi-polar disputes – that is, disputes involving the interests of several different persons – and complex ones could also result in a different outcome was not sufficient reason for requiring the Federal Constitutional Court to correct a court decision. However, there would be a violation of the Constitution if the protective scope (Schutzbereich) or extent of a fundamental right had been wrongly determined and the balancing exercise were accordingly flawed, or if the requirements under constitutional law or the Convention had not been duly taken into account.', '46.  Applying those principles to the case submitted to it, the Federal Constitutional Court observed that the Federal Court of Justice and the criteria it had established were constitutionally unobjectionable. It considered in particular that nothing, from a constitutional-law perspective, had prevented the Federal Court of Justice from departing from its own established case-law in the field and developing a new concept of protection. The fact that it had not itself called into question, in its leading judgment of 15 December 1999, the former concept of protection established by the Federal Court of Justice merely meant that this had been in conformity with constitutional-law criteria. It did not mean, by extension, that a different concept could not meet those criteria. The Federal Court of Justice had not been prevented, in particular, from dispensing with the legal concept of “figure of contemporary society” and instead balancing the competing interests when examining the question whether a photo was an aspect of contemporary society and could accordingly be published without the consent of the person concerned (unless it interfered with a legitimate interest of the latter).', '47.  Applying the criteria thus established to the photos in question, starting with the second and third ones on which an injunction had been imposed by the courts and then challenged by the publishing company Ehrlich & Sohn (see paragraph 40 above), the Federal Constitutional Court noted that the Federal Court of Justice had had regard to the fact that the second photo showed the applicant in a public place which was neither isolated nor out of public view. It had attached decisive weight, however, to the fact that the article concerned only the applicant’s skiing holiday, that is, a situation falling within the core area of private life and concerning the applicant’s need for peace and quiet, and the consequent lack of public interest other than satisfying public curiosity. Contrary to the submissions of the publishing company, the readers’ interest in the applicant’s fashionable ski suit did not amount to a public interest. Moreover, that aspect had not been mentioned anywhere in the article.', '48.  In the opinion of the Federal Constitutional Court, the same conclusion had to be drawn with regard to the third photo whose publication had been challenged by the first applicant. There had been no public interest, beyond merely satisfying public curiosity, in the information contained in either the article commenting on the first applicant and her husband’s trip to St Moritz to celebrate the latter’s birthday or the photo showing them both in a chairlift. Whilst the article had also mentioned the Rose Ball – an event which, according to the Federal Court of Justice, could possibly be regarded as an aspect of contemporary society – no link had been made between that event and the photo.', '49.  With regard to the first photo, the Federal Constitutional Court found that the Federal Court of Justice had had valid grounds for considering that the reigning Prince of Monaco’s ill-health was a matter of general interest and that the press had accordingly been entitled to report on the manner in which the prince’s children reconciled their obligations of family solidarity with the legitimate needs of their private life, among which was the desire to go on holiday. The conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Justice, according to which the photo that had been published had a sufficiently close link with the event described in the article, was constitutionally unobjectionable.', '50.  The Federal Constitutional Court pointed out that the Federal Court of Justice had indicated that the protection of personality rights could prevail in cases where the photo in question had been taken in conditions that were particularly unfavourable for the person concerned, for example where it had been taken surreptitiously or following continual harassment by photographers. However, the publishing company had given details about how the photo had been taken and the first applicant had not complained before the lower civil courts or the Federal Court of Justice that those details were insufficient. In particular, she had not alleged that the photo had been taken in conditions that were unfavourable to her.', '51.  The Federal Constitutional Court also dismissed the first applicant’s allegation that the Federal Court of Justice had disregarded or taken insufficient account of the Court’s case-law. Pointing out that a complaint of that nature could be raised in constitutional proceedings if it was based on a fundamental right guaranteed by the Basic Law, it observed that the Federal Court of Justice had taken account of the judgments delivered in Von Hannover, cited above, and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland (no. 53678/00, ECHR 2004‑X) and had not failed to comply with its obligation to satisfy the criteria established by the Convention. The Federal Constitutional Court had undertaken an analysis of the Court’s relevant case-law and observed that the Court’s decisive criterion when balancing the competing rights was the question whether the report in its entirety (article and photo) contributed to the free formation of public opinion. Furthermore, a distinction had to be drawn between political figures, public figures and ordinary individuals. Whilst the latter enjoyed the greatest protection of the three groups, political figures could expect only a small degree of protection from media reports about themselves.', '52.  According to the Court’s case-law (Gurguenidze v. Georgia, no. 71678/01, § 57, 17 October 2006, and Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, § 27, ECHR 2005-I), the first applicant was a public figure, which allowed the press – where there was an interest in informing the public – to publish photos, even of the person going about his or her daily business in public. Publication of that sort, which, moreover, attracted the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, could serve to exercise public scrutiny over the private conduct of persons who were influential in the economic, cultural or media sectors. The Federal Constitutional Court pointed out that the Court had previously criticised the approach taken by domestic courts which had applied over-restrictive criteria to the question whether the media were or were not reporting matters of public interest when they reported on circumstances relating to the private life of a person who was not part of political life (Tønsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v. Norway, no. 510/04, § 87, 1 March 2007). It was sufficient that the report concerned, at least to some degree, important matters relating to politics or another sphere (Karhuvaara and Iltalehti, cited above, § 45).', '53.  The Federal Constitutional Court concluded that the Federal Court of Justice had found in the present case that the report in question concerned important subjects in a democratic society. In its Von Hannover judgment, cited above, the Court had not categorically excluded the possibility that a report contributing to a debate about questions of interest to the public could be illustrated by photos showing a scene from the daily life of a political or public figure. Even though the Court had concluded in Von Hannover that the photos in question had not been of information value, the decision reached by the Federal Court of Justice – after assessing the circumstances of the case submitted to it and having regard to the Court’s case-law – that the photo in question was of information value was constitutionally unobjectionable.\\n(b)  The second set of proceedings', '54.  On an unspecified date, the first applicant sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court against any further publication of the photo that had appeared in the magazine Frau Aktuell, issue no. 9/02 of 20 February 2002.', '55.  In a judgement of 1 July 2005, the Regional Court granted the applicant’s request.', '56.  In a judgment of 13 December 2005, the Hamburg Court of Appeal allowed an appeal lodged by the publishing company and set aside the Regional Court’s judgment.', '57.  In a judgment of 6 March 2007 (no. VI ZR 14/06), the Federal Court of Justice dismissed an appeal by the first applicant on the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of the same date (no. VI ZR 51/06 – see paragraphs 28-39 above). It stated that the first applicant had not argued before it – and nor was there anything to suggest – that the photo had been taken surreptitiously or with equivalent secret technical devices such as to render its publication unlawful.', '58.  In a decision of 16 June 2008 (no. 1 BvR 1625/07), a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court declined, without giving reasons, to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged by the first applicant.', '59.  On 30 November 2004 the second applicant sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court against any further publication by the Ehrlich & Sohn GmbH & Co. KG publishing company of the three photos that had appeared in the magazine Frau im Spiegel.', '60.  In a judgment of 1 July 2005, the Regional Court granted the injunction.', '61.  In a judgment of 31 January 2006, the Hamburg Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the publishing company.', '62.  In a judgment of 6 March 2007 (no. VI ZR 50/06), the Federal Court of Justice dismissed an appeal on points of law by the second applicant in respect of the first photo. With regard to the second and third photos, it allowed the appeal, quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and reinstated the injunction imposed by the Regional Court. It based its conclusions on the same grounds as those set out in its judgment no. VI ZR 51/06 of the same day (see paragraphs 28-39 above). With regard to the second applicant’s high profile, it upheld the opinion of the Court of Appeal that he was well known to the public, in particular as the husband of the first applicant who was especially the subject of public attention.', '63.  In a decision of 16 June 2008 (no. 1 BvR 1624/07), a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court declined, without giving reasons, to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged by the second applicant.\\n(b)  The second set of proceedings', '64.  On 29 November 2004 the second applicant sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court against any further publication by the WZV Westdeutsche Zeitschriftenverlag GmbH & Co KG publishing company of the photo that had appeared in the magazine Frau Aktuell.', '65.  In a judgment of 24 June 2005, the Regional Court granted the injunction.', '66.  In a judgment of 13 December 2005, the Hamburg Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the publishing company.', '67.  In a judgment of 6 March 2007 (no.

In a decision of 16 June 2008 (no. 1 BvR 1622/07), a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court declined, without giving reasons, to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged by the second applicant.', '69.  The relevant provisions of the Basic Law provide as follows.\\nArticle 1 § 1\\n“The dignity of human beings is inviolable. All public authorities have a duty to respect and protect it.”\\nArticle 2 § 1\\n“Everyone shall have the right to the free development of their personality provided that they do not interfere with the rights of others or violate the constitutional order or moral law [Sittengesetz].”\\nArticle 5 §§ 1 and 2\\n“1.

These rights shall be subject to the limitations laid down by the provisions of the general laws and to statutory provisions for the protection of young people and to the obligation to respect personal honour [Recht der persönlichen Ehre].”', '70.  Section 22(1) of the Copyright (Arts Domain) Act (Gesetz betreffend das Urheberrecht an Werken der bildenden Künste und der Photographie) provides that images can only be disseminated with the express consent of the person concerned. Section 23(1)(1) of the Act provides for exceptions to that rule, where the images portray an aspect of contemporary society (Bildnisse aus dem Bereich der Zeitgeschichte) on condition that publication does not interfere with a legitimate interest (berechtigtes Interesse) of the person concerned (section 23(2)).', '71.  The relevant passages of this Resolution, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 26 June 1998, read as follows.\\n“1.  The Assembly recalls the current affairs debate it held on the right to privacy during its September 1997 session, a few weeks after the accident which cost the Princess of Wales her life. 2.  On that occasion, some people called for the protection of privacy, and in particular that of public figures, to be reinforced at the European level by means of a convention, while others believed that privacy was sufficiently protected by national legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights, and that freedom of expression should not be jeopardised. 3.  In order to explore the matter further, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights organised a hearing in Paris on 16 December 1997 with the participation of public figures or their representatives and the media. 4.  The right to privacy, guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, has already been defined by the Assembly in the declaration on mass communication media and human rights, contained within Resolution 428 (1970), as ‘the right to live one’s own life with a minimum of interference’. 5.  In view of the new communication technologies which make it possible to store and use personal data, the right to control one’s own data should be added to this definition. 6.  The Assembly is aware that personal privacy is often invaded, even in countries with specific legislation to protect it, as people’s private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media. The victims are essentially public figures, since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales. At the same time, public figures must recognise that the position they occupy in society – in many cases by choice – automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy. 7.  Public figures are persons holding public office and/or using public resources and, more broadly speaking, all those who play a role in public life, whether in politics, the economy, the arts, the social sphere, sport or in any other domain. 8.  It is often in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, that the media invade people’s privacy, claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures. 9.  Certain facts relating to the private lives of public figures, particularly politicians, may indeed be of interest to citizens, and it may therefore be legitimate for readers, who are also voters, to be informed of those facts. 10.  It is therefore necessary to find a way of balancing the exercise of two fundamental rights, both of which are guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights: the right to respect for one’s private life and the right to freedom of expression. 11.  The Assembly reaffirms the importance of every person’s right to privacy, and of the right to freedom of expression, as fundamental to a democratic society. These rights are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order, since they are of equal value. 12.  However, the Assembly points out that the right to privacy afforded by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities, but also against interference by private persons or institutions, including the mass media. 13.  The Assembly believes that, since all member States have now ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, and since many systems of national legislation comprise provisions guaranteeing this protection, there is no need to propose that a new convention guaranteeing the right to privacy should be adopted.\\n...”', '72.  The Resolution of the Committee of Ministers (CM/ResDH(2007)124), including the Appendix (extracts), adopted on 31 October 2007 at the 1007th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies, is worded as follows:\\n“The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which provides that the Committee supervises the execution of final judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter ‘the Convention’ and ‘the Court’);\\nHaving regard to the judgments transmitted by the Court to the Committee once they had become final;\\nRecalling that the violation of the Convention found by the Court in this case concerns a breach of the right to respect for private life of the applicant, Princess Caroline von Hannover, the eldest daughter of Prince Rainier III of Monaco, on account of [the] German courts’ refusal of her requests to prohibit publication of a series of photographs of her (see details in Appendix);\\nHaving invited the government of the respondent State to inform the Committee of the measures taken to comply with Germany’s obligation under Article 46, paragraph 1, of the Convention to abide by the judgment;\\nHaving examined the information provided by the government in accordance with the Committee’s Rules for the application of Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention;\\nHaving satisfied itself that, within the time-limit set, the respondent State paid the applicant the just satisfaction provided in the judgment (see details in Appendix);\\nRecalling that a finding of violations by the Court requires, over and above the payment of just satisfaction awarded in the judgment, the adoption by the respondent State, where appropriate, of\\n–  individual measures to put an end to the violations and erase their consequences so as to achieve as far as possible restitutio in integrum; and\\n–  general measures, preventing similar violations;\\nDECLARES, having examined the measures taken by the respondent State (see Appendix), that it has exercised its functions under Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention in this case and\\nDECIDES to close the examination of this case.\\nAppendix to Resolution CM/ResDH(2007)124\\nInformation about the measures to comply with the judgment in the case of\\n...'], 'applicants': ['VON HANNOVER'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['102', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '36', '37']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 26, 27], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 26, 27], 'explained_indices': [31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 32, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 47, 61, 62, 29, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 30, 15, 16, 14, 18, 28, 27, 17, 25, 24, 26, 22, 21, 20, 19, 23, 1, 0, 4, 2, 3], 'explained_distances': [-0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.030100018, -0.03273335, -0.09424552, -0.22109124, -0.24034712, -0.3565317], 'number_of_sentences': 63, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant, Mr Artur Bystrowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1963 and lives in Strzelin.', '6.  On 8 September 2000 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) detained the applicant on remand on suspicion of having committed theft and forgery and of leadership of an organised criminal gang.', '7.  Subsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended on several occasions. In successive decisions, given on 29 November 2000, 15 February and 7 December 2001, 23 August and 2 October 2002, the court repeatedly relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and that there was a real risk that he would receive a severe sentence. This – together with the fact that he had acted in a gang and that there were several co-accused in the case –gave rise to a presumption that he would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings.', '8.  In the meantime, on 9 February 2001 a bill of indictment was issued, charging the applicant with multiple theft, forgery, possession of a firearm without a licence and leadership of an organised criminal gang.', '9.  The first court’s hearing took place on 6 April 2001. Subsequently, nine sessions were scheduled in 2001; eighteen in 2002; sixteen in 2003; and eleven in 2004. In 2001 the trial court heard testimonies of thirty-four witnesses; in 2002 - of forty-six; in 2003 – of five; and in 2004 of four. The court also examined other voluminous evidence and considered various procedural motions filed by the applicant and other co-defendants.', '10.  As the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory 2-year time-limit laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that period. On 20 November and 6 December 2002 and 5 March 2003 the Court of Appeal granted the applications, finding that the grounds previously given for the detention on remand were still valid and that the use of the most severe preventive measure was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation.', '11.  The applicant challenged his detention on remand. He lodged appeals against the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of 15 February 2001, 4 September 2002 and 5 March 2003. His appeals were dismissed by decisions of the Wrocław Court of Appeal of 23 March 2001, 2 October 2002 and 26 March 2003, respectively.', '12.  He also lodged numerous requests for release from detention, which were dismissed by the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of 7 December 2001, 28 June and 8 August 2002.', '13.  Further, he also requested the application of a more lenient preventive measure in place of detention on remand. The request was dismissed by the Wrocław District Prosecutor’s decision of 18 October 2000.', '14.  By a decision of the Wrocław Regional Court of 29 April 2003 the applicant was released from detention.', '15.  On 21 September 2004 the Wrocław Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.', '16.  On an unspecified date, presumably in 2008 the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment.', '17.  The applicant did not lodge a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time with the domestic court, under the Law of 17 June 2004 (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).', '18.  During the detention, the applicant’s requests for visits from his wife were rejected on 23 February, 2 March and 30 April 2001. As stated in the decisions of the Wrocław Regional Court of 2 March and 30 April 2001 this was due to the fact that the wife was a witness in the applicant’s case.', '19.  The applicant further submitted that during his pre-trial detention his correspondence with the Court had been censored. To that effect the applicant supplied an envelope of a letter from the Registry of 12 March 2003 bearing a stamp “censored” (ocenzurowano), a date “21 March 2003” and an illegible signature.', '20.  In his letters to the Court of 21 February and 23 June 2002 and 23 November 2005, the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention in Wrocław Remand Centre.', '21.  He alleged in particular that he was detained with six other persons in a room measuring 16m2; he could only take walks in a closed area measuring 20m2 for 25 persons; there was no warm water available and the ventilation and sanitation were insufficient.', '22.  The applicant complained to the detention centre’s authorities about those conditions, however to no avail.

The case was directed against the Rybnik Mining Company “Chwalowice”.', '7.  Between 20 September 1982 and 21 October 1991 the applicant on five occasions lodged similar applications.', '8.  On 15 January 1990 the District Commission for Mining Damage examined one of her applications. It partly allowed it and awarded the applicant compensation.', \"9.  It appears that following the applicant's appeal, on 12 November 1991, the District Commission for Mining Damage amended its own decision.\", '10.  The applicant appealed against this decision. She submitted, inter alia, that the Commission failed to examine her four applications lodged in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1988.', '11.  On 30 September 1992 the Katowice Appellate Commission for Mining Damage (Odwoławcza Komisja do spraw Szkód Górniczych) quashed the impugned decision and remitted the case to the District Commission. It ordered the Commission to examine all applications for compensation lodged by the applicant between 1973 and 1991.', '12.  On 24 March 1993 the District Commission for Mining Damage gave its decision. The applicant appealed against it.', '13.  On 2 September 1994 a new law entered into force which provided that the civil courts would be competent to examine the applications for compensation for mining damage and abolished the Commissions for Mining Damage (Ustawa z dnia 4 lutego 1994, Prawo geologiczne i górnicze).', \"14.  Accordingly, the applicant's case was transferred to the Rybnik District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) which, on 24 January 1995, decided that the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) would be competent to examine the case.\", '15.  On 5 April 1995 the court held a hearing.', \"16.  Between 7 June 1995 and 4 April 1996 the proceedings were stayed since the applicant's counsel had apparently failed to specify her claims.\", '17.

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Sztum.', '5.  On 20 October 2000 the Otwock District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed aggravated murder and robbery. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence and the fact that the applicant was a recidivist offender. Finally, the court found that there were no special grounds, as specified in Article 259 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe preventive measure.', '6.  The applicant’s appeal against the detention order and his further appeals against some of the decisions extending his detention as well as his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.', '7.  In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended by the Warsaw Regional Court on 4 January, 9 April and 5 July 2001. In all their detention decisions the courts repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention.

The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention. The court found that his continued detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.', '11.  On 27 August 2002 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. He was also deprived of his civic rights for a period of five years. The court further ordered that the period spent by the applicant in pre–trial detention from 20 October 2000 up to the date of his conviction was to be deducted from the sentence imposed.', '12.  The applicant appealed. He was kept in detention pending the outcome of his appeal for three months.', '13.  On 26 November 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal heard the applicant’s appeal.

The applicants, a married couple, were born in 1960 and 1957 respectively and live in the village of Prigorodnoye in the Chechen Republic.', '7.  The applicants are the parents of Mr Vidzha Umayev, born in 1982. The first applicant is the sister of Mr Timur Mezhidov, born in 1972. The latter is the brother-in-law of the second applicant.', '8.  The description of the events below is based on the information contained in the application form and written statements by the first and second applicants, dated 17 and 23 July 2007 respectively.\\n(a)  The detention of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov', '9.  On 14 July 2006 the first applicant, Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov were travelling in the applicants’ VAZ-2107 vehicle from the village of Nikhaloy to the village of Prigorodnoye.', '10.  At the Russian federal forces roadblock located at the entrance point of Shatoy village (hereinafter “the Shatoy roadblock”) Russian servicemen stopped the applicants’ vehicle to carry out a check. At the roadblock the first applicant saw a group of seven to eight servicemen of Chechen ethnic origin, who were standing near a silver-grey four-door Niva vehicle and speaking to each other in Chechen. The first applicant observed them for a while and was able to memorise their faces. She also specifically noticed that, whilst the servicemen from the roadblock who checked the identity papers were Russian, those standing by the Niva vehicle were Chechen. After checking Vidzha Umayev’s and Timur Mezhidov’s identity papers, Russian servicemen entered the relevant information in the roadblock logbooks and allowed them to continue their journey.', '11.  The first applicant, Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov then drove through Shatoyskiy District and crossed the border into Groznenskiy District. At the bridge in the vicinity of the entrance point of Yarash-Mardy village they saw three Chechen servicemen from the group they had already seen at the Shatoy roadblock. The servicemen walked towards the vehicle and ordered it to stop. One of the servicemen ordered the driver and the passengers, in Chechen, to get out of the vehicle. Vidzha Umayev, Timur Mezhidov and the first applicant complied with the order and got out of the car. One of the servicemen then ordered Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov to get back into the applicants’ vehicle. They obeyed and got into the back seats. At the same moment two servicemen joined them in the back seat, the third serviceman got into the driver’s seat and the vehicle moved off quickly. Vidzha Umayev shouted in Chechen: “That’s my mother! Don’t leave her alone!” and the first applicant rushed towards the car. However, the car did not stop and the first applicant ran into a bridge barrier and fell to the ground.', '12.  The applicants have not seen Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov since.\\n(b)  The applicants’ search for their missing relatives', '13.  On 14 July 2006, shortly after the car with the abductors had left, the first applicant managed to stop a private vehicle, which took her home. Once there she told the second applicant about the abduction, and the applicants immediately left for Shatoy, intending to alert the Shatoyskiy District Department of the Interior (“the ROVD”) to the incident.', '14.  On their way, about 2.5 km from the bridge, where the first applicant, her son and brother had been stopped by the Chechen servicemen, the applicants saw their VAZ-2107 vehicle. It was parked about fifty metres from the road, at a dugout in which were two Russian servicemen. In the applicants’ submission, on that day Russian military forces had groups of servicemen stationed at the Shatoy road at about 200 metres distance from each other. The applicants saw that three of the doors of their VAZ-2107 vehicle were open and its headlights were on. Vidzha Umayev’s mobile phone was in the vehicle. The first applicant asked the servicemen how their car had arrived at the dugout. They replied that it had arrived there, followed by a four-door silver-grey Niva vehicle. Two people were taken out of the VAZ-2107 vehicle and put into the silver-grey Niva vehicle, which then left in the direction of the village of Duba-Yurt.', '15.  After that the applicants took Vidzha Umayev’s mobile phone and went to the ROVD. From there the second applicant, the head of the ROVD, whom the applicants identified as “Sayd-Akhmed”, and several police officers left for the Shatoy roadblock. The first applicant stayed at the ROVD and lodged a written complaint about the abduction of her son and brother.', '16.  On the same day, on arrival at the Shatoy roadblock, the second applicant and Sayd-Akhmed spoke to a senior roadblock officer from the Shatoyskiy District military commander’s office. He confirmed that the servicemen at the roadblock had checked Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov’s identity papers and stated that everything was in order, and that the two men had been let through the roadblock and had left. Meanwhile the first applicant also arrived at the roadblock. While the second applicant was speaking to the officer, a UAZ vehicle with two Chechen servicemen in it arrived at the roadblock. The first applicant identified them as members of the group of Chechen servicemen she had seen at the Shatoy roadblock while the authorities were checking her relatives’ identity papers. The applicants immediately asked those servicemen where the other members of their group were and where they had taken Vidzha Umarov and Timur Mezhidov. The two men laughed and answered that they had not arrested Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov. They also stated that they did not know the other servicemen who had been at the Shatoy roadblock with them. According to the applicants, the head of the ROVD told them that the two Chechen servicemen were from the special Vostok Russian Military Battalion of the Main Intelligence Service (“the GRU”) and that they were called “Yamadayevtsy” after their commander Sulim Yamadayev. The applicants then returned home.', '17.  On 15 July 2006 the applicants again complained to various State bodies about the abduction of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov. They did not keep copies of those complaints.', '18.  On 17 or 18 July 2006 a certain Mr I.A., a GRU officer, visited the applicants and told the second applicant that a certain Mr R., a GRU colonel and commander of the 921st regiment, wished to talk to him.', '19.  On 23 July 2006 the applicants and Mr I.A. drove to a Russian federal forces base located in the village of Borzoy in the Chechen Republic. The second applicant left his vehicle, with the first applicant and Mr I.A. inside. At the military base checkpoint he was met by two Russian servicemen, one of them a warrant officer and the other a captain. They accompanied the second applicant into the checkpoint building, where Mr R. was already waiting for him.', '20.  Mr R. confirmed that the applicant’s son was being held in the military base and said that he “opened his eyes when touched but then rolled them up”. Mr R. then asked the second applicant to write a note for his son, “telling him to answer their questions”. The second applicant asked Mr R. what statement they wanted from his son, but received no reply. The second applicant then handed over to Mr R. medical certificates attesting to his son’s disability. Mr R. looked at them, and from his reaction the second applicant inferred that Mr R. had realised that his servicemen had beaten up a seriously ill person. The second applicant then told Mr R. that he would not write any notes for his son and requested that he be released. Mr R. replied that “they did not have a deal then” and ordered the servicemen to accompany the second applicant to the exit, which they did. The second applicant returned to the car and left the premises with the first applicant.', '21.  On an unspecified date in October 2006 the first applicant received a phone call on her mobile phone from a person who whispered “Mother, mother!” and then suddenly the conversation was disconnected. The first applicant inferred that it was Vidzha Umayev and, since the number was displayed, she called back. A woman replied to her in Russian and immediately hung up. When the first applicant dialled the number again, a man’s voice told her not to call that number any more. The first applicant informed the law-enforcement authorities about the call. In the applicants’ submission, at the material time the only company providing mobile communication services in the Chechen Republic was Megafon. The figures 923 indicated that the number from which she had received the call was not a Megafon number but was from another company. In the applicants’ opinion, only Russian army servicemen could have had phone numbers from mobile communication providers other than Megafon.', '22.  On an unspecified date in November 2006 Mr I.A. visited the applicants again and offered them information on Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov in exchange for 50,000 Russian roubles (RUB). Two days later the second applicant met Mr I.A. in Prigorodnoye and the latter told him that Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov were not alive. Mr I.A. promised the second applicant that their bodies would be retrieved, and left.', '23.  Two days later the second applicant and his relative went to the village of Borzoy to meet Mr I.A. He told the second applicant that there were three mass graves in Borzoy but he did not know in which of them Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov had been buried. He also specified that their bodies were in different graves and that they “had been shot dead by Chechens in the presence of a Russian”. He noted however that he had not witnessed the killings.', '24.  On an unspecified date the second applicant contacted a Russian army general whom he knew well and told him about Mr R. The general told the applicant that this was the first time he heard that name and that it must have been a false name.', '25.  The Government submitted that on 14 July 2006, on the road between Grozny and Shatoy, near the bridge close to the village of Yarysh‑Mardy, three unidentified individuals wearing camouflage uniforms and carrying automatic weapons had stopped a vehicle in which Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov were travelling, following which the latter disappeared.', '26.  It appears that following the applicants’ complaints about the abduction of their relatives the ROVD carried out an inquiry into their allegations. The inquiry was given the number 81. The exact date of the opening of the inquiry remains unclear.', '27.  On 25 July 2006 the prosecutor’s office of the Groznenskiy District (“the district prosecutor’s office”) received the inquiry file from the ROVD.', '28.  On the same date the district prosecutor’s office instituted a criminal investigation in respect of the abduction of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov under Article 126 § 2 of the Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping). The case file was assigned the number 54063. The decision stated that at about 4 p.m. on 14 July 2006 at the bridge near Yarysh-Mardy village, three unidentified armed individuals in camouflage uniforms had stopped the VAZ-2107 vehicle in which Vidzha Umayev, Timur Mezhidov and the first applicant were travelling, and had taken Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov to an unknown destination.', '29.  By a letter of 26 July 2006 the prosecutor’s office of the Chechen Republic (“the republican prosecutor’s office”) replied to the first applicant that it had examined her complaint about the abduction of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov and informed her that on 25 July 2006 the district prosecutor’s office had opened a criminal investigation in respect of the abduction of her son and brother.', '30.  On 20 September 2006 the first applicant was granted victim status in connection with the proceedings in case 54063. She was informed of that decision on 21 September 2006.', '31.  On 28 May 2007 the first applicant wrote to the President of the Chechen Republic. She described in detail the circumstances of the abduction of her relatives and her attempts to find them and asked for assistance in her search for them.', '32.  On 15 June 2007 the republican prosecutor’s office replied to the first applicant that on 25 July 2006 the district prosecutor’s office had opened a criminal case in respect of the abduction of her relatives. The letter also stated that on 25 October 2006 the investigation in case 54063 had been suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.', '33.  On 17 July 2007 the first applicant wrote to the district prosecutor’s office, seeking information on the progress of the investigation in case 54063. She requested that the proceedings be resumed if they had been suspended and sought access to the investigation case file and permission to make copies from it. There is no indication that the applicant’s request was ever replied to.', '34.  By a letter of 22 June 2007 the district prosecutor’s office informed the first applicant that on 22 July 2007 it had resumed the investigation in case 54063.', '35.  In the applicants’ submission, in October 2007 the district prosecutor’s office informed them orally that on an unspecified date the investigation in case 54063 had been suspended again.', '36.  The Government refused to submit any documents from criminal case file concerning the abduction of the applicants’ relatives, referring to Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure.\\n(b)  Information concerning the progress of the investigation of the abduction of the applicants’ relatives', '37.  The information about the investigation provided by the Government can be summarised as follows.', '38.  On 25 July 2006 the district prosecutor’s office opened a criminal investigation in respect of the abduction of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov under Article 126 § 2 of the Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping). The case file was assigned the number 54063.', '39.  On 25 October 2006 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.', '40.  On 22 June 2007 the investigation was resumed because the investigating authorities had established that serviceman R.D. of military unit 44822 was implicated in the abduction.', '41.  On 21 July 2007 Mr R.D.’s name was put on a wanted list.', '42.  On 6 June 2008 the investigation of the abduction of the applicants’ relatives was entrusted to an investigating committee of the prosecutor’s office of the Russian Federation in the Chechen Republic (hereinafter “the investigating committee”).', '43.  On 8 July 2008 the investigating committee issued a decision to formally charge Mr R.D. with abducting the applicants’ relatives and the criminal case was transferred to the military investigating department with the United Group Alignment of the Military Forces for Counterterrorist Operations in the North Caucasus Region (hereinafter the “investigating department”). The case file was given the number 34/00/0023-08.', '44.  It appears that shortly thereafter the investigation was suspended again and that it was resumed on 11 November 2009.', '45.  In the Government’s submission the investigation in case 34/00/0023-08 is still pending.\\n(c)  The findings of the investigation', '46.  The Government stated that the findings of the preliminary investigation confirmed the version of events submitted by the applicants.', '47.  In the Government’s submission, the preliminary investigation established that Mr R.D. had been doing military service in military unit 44822 of the Vostok special-purpose battalion (previously an infantry battalion) since 10 August 2004. In mid-July 2006 Mr R.D. had colluded with two unidentified individuals with a view to abducting Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov. On 14 July 2006, having acquired information on the route taken by Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov, Mr R.D., armed with an automatic weapon, organised an ambush at the Grozny-Shatoy road near Yarysh-Mardy with a view to arresting and abducting them. At about 4 p.m. on the same day Mr R.D. stopped the VAZ-2107 vehicle with Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov, following which “Mr R.D. and two armed men in camouflage uniforms arrested them and took them to an unknown destination”, leaving the first applicant behind.', '48.  In the Government’s submission, the above account of the events was confirmed by the first applicant, who had been granted victim status, and the second applicant, who had been interviewed as a witness. The applicants also informed the investigators that following the abduction they had learnt from Mr I.A. that their abducted relatives had been held at the military base in the village of Borzoy and eventually killed.', '49.  The first applicant confirmed those submissions during a check of her statement at the crime scene (проверка показаний на месте совершения преступления) and identified Mr R.D. from a photograph as the person who had abducted her son and brother.', '50.  Mr I.A., interviewed on an unspecified date, stated that he had learnt about the abduction of Vidzha Umayev and Timur Mezhidov from Z.M. The second applicant had contacted Mr I.A. six months after the abduction, asking the latter to organise a meeting with officers of the military base, following which they had met a serviceman named Volodya, who had asked for RUB 50,000 for information about the applicants’ son and had then informed them that the applicants’ relatives had been killed.\\n(d)  Information concerning criminal case 68800', '51.

In addition, the court referred to the fact that the applicant had been sought by means of a wanted notice.\", '10.  The applicant appealed against this decision. He asked the court to consider imposing alternative measures - such as bail or police supervision -to secure the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings. He further claimed that he needed to take care of his disabled parents and his child.', '11.  On 13 July 1998 the applicant was indicted before the Cracow Regional Court.', \"12.

The first applicant, Novaya Gazeta Editorial and Publishing House, is an autonomous non-governmental organisation registered under Russian law in Moscow on 24 June 1998. It edits and publishes a daily national newspaper with circulation of 500,000 copies under the name Novaya Gazeta.', '6.  The second applicant, Mr G. Borodyanskiy, was born in 1959 and lives in Omsk. He is one of the regional journalists of Novaya Gazeta in Omsk, Tomsk, and Tyumen Regions.', '7.  In 2006 Novaya Gazeta published a series of articles by the second applicant.', '8.  On 27 November 2006 the newspaper published in both its printed and online versions an article by the second applicant entitled ‘Personalities received loans’ («Кредиты выдали под лица») (“the article”). It concerned alleged irregularities in the issuance of large unpaid loans by Sberbank (Savings Bank). The text described several fraudulent schemes which were used to obtain up to 147,000,000 euros (EUR) in loans from Sberbank, and listed certain individuals allegedly involved in these schemes. Among others the article mentioned Mr R.M., a politician and businessman from Kazakhstan with significant business interests in agricultural production in Omsk Region. A brief update on the criminal inquiry into the alleged loan fraud concluded the article.', '9.  The article contained, in particular, the following four fragments:\\n“[1] In this case the interests of an important politician – the President of the Agrarian Party of Kazakhstan, which is the second most influential party [in that country] after the Otan Party headed by Mr Nazarbayev [the President of Kazakhstan], [Mr R.M.], were involved.\\n[2] In Omsk [Mr R.M.] controls the Kirovskiy Grain Elevator, the biggest flour producer in the Omsk Region, [limited liability company] M, a bread factory and dozens of successful enterprises.\\n[3] It would be inconceivable for anyone to achieve such success in our region without the benevolence (благоволение) of the Governor [Mr P.] who has held senior public office in Kazakhstan for more than twenty years. And this biographical fact of [Mr P.], naturally, has linked the republic [of Kazakhstan] and the [Omsk] region ever closer with ‘fraternal bonds’.\\n[4] The Kirovskiy Grain Elevator sent forged certificates to Sberbank confirming that different companies [had] grain which actually never existed. Those certificates were issued by its CEO, Ms Zh. According to the investigators, each certificate cost fifty to seventy thousand roubles. Loans were given on the basis of those certificates in the amount of half a billion roubles.”', '10.  On 11 December 2006 Mr P., the Governor of Omsk Region, lodged a libel action against the first and second applicants with the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of Omsk (the District Court). He sought recognition of statements about him as libellous, publication of a rectification in Novaya Gazeta, and 500,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in non-pecuniary damages.', '11.  The court proceedings started on 20 December 2006.', '12.  On 26 December 2006 the applicants were notified about the next hearing on 11 January 2007, which was subsequently adjourned to 15 January 2007. The applicants were notified of the change of date.', '13.  On 14 January 2007 the first applicant requested the trial court to adjourn the hearing by three more weeks in order to prepare its written comments on the lawsuit.', '14.  On 15 January 2007 the District Court refused to further adjourn the hearing, because the applicant newspaper did not advance any reasons why its representative could not appear for the hearing and why it did not submit its written comments on the lawsuit between 20 December 2006 and 15 January 2007.', '15.  The trial court held a hearing in the defendants’ absence and allowed Mr P.’s action in part. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows:\\n“... In accordance with Article 23 of the Constitution protection of every citizen’s good name is guaranteed.\\nUnder Article 152 of the Civil Code an individual may apply to a court with a request for rectification of statements that are damaging to his honour, dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements can not prove their truthfulness ...”\\nThe trial court also established that the statements about Mr P. (reproduced above in paragraph 9) were disseminated by the applicants in printed and online versions of Novaya Gazeta, and thus became known to an indeterminate number of readers. It continued:\\n“... In consideration of defamation disputes the following must be established: whether the defendant had disseminated statements about the plaintiff, whether those statements were discrediting, and whether those statements were false.\\nThe statements about the plaintiff had been disseminated ...”\\nThe defendants did not present any evidence that Mr P. had engaged in activities aimed at providing certain businessmen and commercial organisations with privileges, or that he had in fact abused his powers to further certain individuals’ interests ...\\nThe author of the article referred to benevolence (благоволение) on the part of the Governor towards a renowned politician, the President of the Agrarian Party of Kazakhstan, [Mr R.M.]\\n“Benevolence” is to be understood as good will, a favourable attitude, approval, expression of satisfaction, and gratitude ...\\nThe statement that “in our region ... the Governor”, by using his office, shows benevolence [or] approval of the actions of [Mr R.M.] in ‘control of the Kirovskiy Grain Elevator’, is not compatible with the office of a state official. These statements, taken in conjunction with other paragraphs of the article (about [Mr R.M.], about issuance of false certificates to procure loans), create a negative image of the plaintiff, and could generate scepticism as to the plaintiff’s compliance with the ethical principles expected of the head of the executive authority in the region ... [T]hese statements characterise the plaintiff’s actions as aimed at providing certain businessmen and commercial organisations with privileges, and as an abuse of his powers to further the interests of certain individuals ...”\\nThe trial court concluded that the statements were defamatory, and that rectification of the disseminated statements must be published in printed and online versions of Novaya Gazeta. It further stated:\\n“... When determining the level of non-pecuniary damages the court considers the degree of distress caused to the plaintiff by the extent of the dissemination of false statements. The newspaper is distributed in nine regions of Russia and in two foreign countries. The article was also published on line ... [on a website] with at least 91,369 readers weekly ... Having regard to these circumstances, the court orders the defendants to pay RUB 60,000 [in compensation] ...”\\nIt addition to RUB 60,000 (EUR 1,623) in non-pecuniary damages the plaintiff was also awarded RUB 100 (EUR 2.5) in court fees, to be paid by the applicants jointly.', '16.  On 9 March 2007 the first applicant appealed, claiming, in particular, that the article contained value judgments not susceptible of proof and that the District Court had failed to duly notify it of the date and time of the hearing. According to the heading of the appeal statement, the second applicant was a co-defendant.', '17.  On 25 July 2007 the Omsk Regional Court, in the presence of the parties to the proceedings and hearing their statements, upheld the lower court’s judgment. It reasoned that the District Court had correctly concluded that the information in the article had tarnished the plaintiff’s reputation, and dismissed the first applicant’s description of it as a value judgment. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows:\\n“The following claims in the defendants’ appeal are not justified: that the statements are not discrediting, that they may not be regarded as assertions, and that they are merely opinions, value judgments by the author and thus not susceptible of proof.\\nThe [trial] court rightly noted that the author of the article, by claiming that the Governor has “benevolence” towards [Mr. R.M.], alleged approval of [his] control over the Kirovskiy Grain Elevator ...”\\nAt the same time the Regional Court ruled that the statement in paragraph 4 of the article reproduced above was not defamatory, as it did not refer to any abuse of powers by Mr P. Further, it dismissed the first applicant’s claim that it had not been summoned to the district court hearing, stating that several notifications had in fact been sent to the defendants.', '18.  The Regional Court ruled in the final judgment that the first applicant was to publish a rectification of the statements contained in paragraphs 1-3 of the article reproduced above, and that the applicants were to pay Mr P. jointly RUB 60,100 in non-pecuniary damages and court fees.', '19.  Following this judgment, the first applicant published a rectification in the printed and online versions of Novaya Gazeta and paid Mr P. non-pecuniary damages and court fees.'], 'applicants': ['NOVAYA GAZETA', 'BORODYANSKIY'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['15', '29', '30', '5', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [0, 4, 10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [0, 4, 10], 'explained_indices': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3], 'explained_distances': [-0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.05648631, -0.071832985, -0.112252116, -0.13703302, -0.21194175, -0.52848613], 'number_of_sentences': 15, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1968 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Sokal Prison no. 47 in the Lviv region.', '6.  In February 2000 the applicant was detained on suspicion of several counts of robbery and a murder. He claimed that he had been beaten by the police.', '7.  On 13 September 2000 the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court (“the Zaporizhzhya Court”), sitting as a court of first instance, found the applicant guilty as charged. It sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder and considered that the prison terms for the other crimes were absorbed by the life sentence. The court dismissed the applicant’s allegation of ill-treatment as unsubstantiated.', '8.  On 21 December 2000 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the judgment.', '9.  On 30 October 2009 the Supreme Court reviewed the applicant’s case under an extraordinary procedure and commuted his sentence to fifteen years’ imprisonment. It reasoned that life imprisonment had not been listed as a possible penalty in the Criminal Code on the date when the murder for which the applicant had been sentenced had been committed.', '10.  On 6 December 2001 the applicant was transferred to Vinnytsya Prison no. 1, which had a section for life prisoners, to serve his sentence. That prison is located some 700 kilometres from Zaporizhzhya, where the applicant had been living before his detention and where his mother lived. The train journey from Zaporizhzhya to Vinnytsya takes from twelve to sixteen hours.', '11.  On numerous occasions the applicant and his mother, Mrs Kapiton, who acted on his behalf as his representative under a power of attorney, asked the State Department of Ukraine for the Enforcement of Sentences (“the Prison Department”) to transfer the applicant to a prison closer to his home to make it easier for her to visit him. They drew attention, in particular, to the long travel time from Zaporizhzhya to Vinnytsya by public transport, which was very burdensome for Mrs Kapiton given her advanced age (born in 1938) and poor health (she had been officially certified “second-degree” (medium) disabled).', '12.  On 10 June and 15 September 2004 the Prison Department replied to the applicant’s mother that her request had been rejected, since “in accordance with the legislation in force, convicted prisoners must serve their entire sentence in the same prison”.', '13.  On 29 October 2004 Mrs Kapiton arrived at Vinnytsya Prison to visit the applicant. During the visit she fainted and was provided with medical assistance for low blood pressure. Her meeting with the applicant was not resumed once she had recovered, on the recommendation of a medical professional.', '14.  On many subsequent occasions Mrs Kapiton continued to contact various authorities on her own and the applicant’s behalf, requesting his transfer to a prison closer to his home to enable her to visit him. She always enclosed with her requests the medical certificate confirming her disability and her doctor’s advice not to travel outside the Zaporizhzhya region.', '15.  All Mrs Kapiton’s requests were rejected. On numerous occasions (on 2, 12 and 18 November 2004, and on 12 February, 21 and 24 March 2005) the Prison Department repeated its previous reasoning, referring to the legal requirement that prisoners must serve their entire prison term in the same establishment.', '16.  On 17 March 2006 the Prison Department informed the applicant’s mother that her request could not be granted because no places were available for life prisoners in establishments closer to Zaporizhzhya.', '17.  On 3 May 2006 the Prison Department wrote to the applicant’s mother again, informing her that the applicant was supposed to serve his entire sentence in the same prison and that, in any event, there were no places available in prisons closer to his home.', '18.  On 7 August 2006 the Prison Department further notified the applicant that, in accordance with unspecified regulations, persons convicted of aggravated murder were usually detained in prisons located outside the region in which the crime had been committed.', '19.  On 16 November 2006, 8 August 2007 and 24 March 2009 the Prison Department reiterated, in reply to the repeated requests of the applicant’s mother for his transfer, that “under the legislation in force, convicted prisoners must serve their entire sentence in the same prison”.', '20.  On 1 December 2009, following a review of the applicant’s sentence (see paragraph 9 above), the Prison Department’s regional commission on prisoner distribution, allocation and transfers examined his case. It decided that he would be held in a maximum-security prison, in ordinary accommodation. Pursuant to that decision, on 10 December 2009 he was transferred to Sokal Prison no. 47 (a maximum-security prison) located in the Lviv region, around 1,000 kilometres from Zaporizhzhya. The train journey from Zaporizhzhya to Lviv takes from nineteen to twenty-three hours.', '21.  On an unspecified date Mrs Kapiton complained to the Prison Department that that transfer was unfair, as Sokal Prison was even further away from the applicant’s home address.', '22.  On 17 February 2010 the administrative commission of Sokal Prison examined the applicant’s request that the level of security of his prison regime be reduced from high to medium security. It was noted that, under the Code on the Enforcement of Sentences, a prisoner could be transferred from a high to a medium-security prison if he had already served more than half of his sentence and if he had been manifesting good behaviour as an indication of his willingness to improve. However, the applicant had been disciplined eleven times and was not therefore eligible for such a transfer. Accordingly, his request was rejected. It remained open for him to challenge that decision before the regional commission of the Prison Department.', '23.  On 17 April 2010 the Prison Department’s regional commission on prisoner distribution, allocation and transfers rejected the applicant’s request for transfer to a prison in the Zaporizhzhya region. As noted in the minutes of its meeting, the applicant had been disciplined twelve times.', '24.  On 26 April 2010 the Prison Department further informed Mrs Kapiton that its appeal board had rejected the applicant’s request for transfer to a medium-security prison in the Zaporizhzhya region, and that decision would be reviewed only if his conduct improved.', '25.  The applicant’s mother then requested the applicant’s transfer to a prison in the Donetsk or Lugansk region (neighbouring the Zaporizhzhya region).', '26.  On 17 November 2010 the Prison Department appeal board rejected her request. As noted in its meeting report, the applicant had been disciplined fifteen times and had received no incentives.', '27.  The applicant suffers from ingrowing eyelashes of the left eye, which have to be removed periodically. His mother made a general allegation, without providing any factual details, that he had been hit in his left eye following his arrival at Vinnytsya Prison. No further information is available as to the duration and origin of the above-mentioned condition.', '28.  As regards the medical treatment for the ingrowing eyelashes, the applicant’s submissions to the Court were limited to his mother’s general statement, which she had made on two occasions, in November 2005 and April 2010, that the responsibility for the condition lay with the authorities and that, although the ingrowing eyelashes were regularly removed, the applicant felt pain and discomfort in his left eye.', '29.  On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant’s mother complained to the prosecutor’s office that the applicant’s eye problem was connected to his alleged beating by prison guards following his arrival at the prison in 2001.', '30.  On 5 and 25 April 2005 the Vinnytsya Prosecutor’s Office responded that there was no basis for launching a criminal inquiry into that complaint. In particular, the applicant had not requested a medical examination or assistance on account of any injuries inflicted on him. Furthermore, according to the testimony of other prisoners who had arrived at the prison together with the applicant, they had not experienced or witnessed any beatings. The prosecutor also noted that the applicant’s condition was under constant medical supervision. In particular, he had his ingrowing eyelashes removed by a qualified ophthalmologist on a regular basis. No other health-related complaints had been recorded.', '31.  According to extracts from the applicant’s medical file provided by the Government, the applicant had had his ingrowing eyelashes removed on 21 January, 26 March, 9 July and 13 December 2004, as well as on 1 August 2005 and 4 January 2008. Furthermore, on 30 June 2010 and 6 April 2012 he had refused medical examinations and treatment.', '32.  The applicant and his mother, acting on his behalf, complained to the prosecution authorities and the Prison Department about the routine monitoring of his correspondence by the prison administration.', '33.  The prosecutor’s response was that the applicant’s correspondence was subject to monitoring under the legislation in force; however, there had been no instances of withholding letters or seizing objects which the prisoners were allowed to keep.', '34.  On 7 July 2003 the Vinnytsya Regional Prison Department wrote to the applicant’s mother, in reply to her complaint regarding, in particular, the interference with his correspondence, that on 11, 16 and 23 April 2003 the prison administration had “withheld some letters written by [the applicant], because their content did not comply with the requirements of the Instruction on Review of Prisoners’ Correspondence”.', '35.  On 3 October 2006 the Prison Department informed the applicant’s mother that no correspondence had been withheld from the applicant and that since the beginning of the year he had sent fifty-one letters and had received twenty-four recommended letters and thirty-eight standard letters. There had been no complaints from the applicant himself regarding his correspondence.', '36.  On 14 November 2006 the applicant made a written statement that he had no complaints against the prison administration.', '37.  On 21 November 2006 the Vinnytsya Regional Prosecutor’s Office wrote to the applicant’s mother informing her that the applicant had sent fifty-six letters, had received seventy-two letters, and that he had had fifteen paid telephone conversations.', '38.  On 12 May 2008 the applicant made a written statement that he had no complaints concerning the work of the prison official in charge of the monitoring of prisoners’ correspondence.', '39.  On 19 June 2008 the applicant asked the prison administration to allow him to make a telephone call on 24 June 2008 instead of a short-term private meeting to which he was entitled. According to a hand-written note on the request, apparently added by a prison official, the applicant’s last private meeting had been on 26 December 2007.', '40.  On 27 July 2009 the applicant asked the prison administration to allow him to make a telephone call on 3 August 2009. As noted on the request, he had last made a telephone call on 3 May 2009.', '41.  According to the official records, during the period from 16 August 2002 to 30 September 2009 the Vinnytsya prison administration dispatched sixty-nine letters from the applicant.'], 'applicants': ['VINTMAN'], 'defendants': ['UKRAINE'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '8'], 'violated_articles': ['8', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['133', '138', '27', '28', '31', '34', '45'], '13': ['10', '11', '26', '42', '43', '44', '50', '52', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '69'], 'X': ['60']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29], 'explained_indices': [3, 1, 0, 4, 6, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 29, 21, 31, 32, 33, 34, 28, 20, 18, 35, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 19, 36, 2, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.2695157, 0.21467435, 0.20536622, 0.19836485, 0.1846936, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.17991537, 0.120182306, 0.049800098], 'number_of_sentences': 37, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

For that purpose she provided, among other materials, an identity photograph which showed her wearing a headscarf.', '7.  On 1 October 1998 the Faculty of Theology of Marmara University replied to the applicant, informing her that the identity photograph she had supplied did not comply with the regulations in force and that where this was the case, the person concerned could not be enrolled.', '8.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Istanbul Administrative Court. She requested, in particular, that the refusal of the administrative authorities be set aside as being in breach of her rights.', '9.  In a judgment of 23 September 1999, the Administrative Court rejected the application, finding that the authorities’ refusal had been in accordance with the regulations in force. The court considered, in particular, that the applicant had submitted an identity photograph which did not conform to the regulations, which stipulated that “photographs must show the subject facing forward and be less than six months old, so that the person concerned is readily identifiable; the head and neck must also be uncovered” (Article 4 § 1 (f) of the Guide for University Applicants adopted by the Higher Education Board on 17 April 1998).', '10.

On 15 January 1997 a criminal investigation was opened against the applicants and two other persons and on 4 April 1997 they were indicted for trespassing, inflicting grievous bodily harm causing the death of the victim and making false statements to the police.', '7.  Between 13 May 1997 and 21 April 1998, the Mureş County Court adjourned the proceedings nine times pending the summoning of several witnesses requested by the prosecutor and the summoning of witnesses and examination of other evidence requested on three occasions by the applicants.', '8.  On 29 May 1998 the Mureş County Court adjourned delivery of the judgment at the request of the applicants’ representatives, who asked permission to submit written pleadings.', '9.  On 5 June 1998 the Mureş County Court convicted the applicants of inflicting grievous bodily harm causing the death of the victim as defined in Article 183 of the Criminal Code, and trespassing, and sentenced them each to three years’ imprisonment. The applicant Ştefan Şopterean was also given a suspended sentence for insulting a police officer and causing a breach of the peace. All three applicants were ordered to pay civil damages jointly.', '10.  The applicants and the prosecutor appealed against the judgment of the Mureş County Court.', '11.  At the first hearing before the Târgu Mureş Court of Appeal on 23 December 1998 the prosecutor requested that the court change the legal classification of the acts committed by the applicants to aggravated murder as defined in Article 174 taken together with Article 176 of the Criminal Code. Under those circumstances, the applicants requested an adjournment of the proceedings in order to prepare their defence.', '12.  On 3 February 1999 the Court of Appeal heard all the parties in the trial and decided to adjourn delivery of the judgment to 18 February and subsequently to 4 March 1999.', '13.

The applicants’ lawyers asked the court to reject that request and to adjourn delivery of the judgment in order for them to submit written observations. The court adjourned delivery of the judgment to 3 December and subsequently to 10 December 1999. Written observations on behalf of the applicants were submitted to the case-file before the delivery of the judgment.', '16.  On 10 December 1999 the Mureş County Court, after a thorough analysis of all the evidence contained in the file, rejected the prosecutor’s request for the reclassification of the acts committed by the applicants and upheld their previous conviction for inflicting grievous bodily harm causing the death of the victim as defined in Article 183 of the Criminal Code, and trespassing. The amount of the civil damages the applicants were ordered to pay jointly was increased.', '17.  Appeals by the prosecutor and the applicants against the above‑mentioned judgment were allowed by the Târgu Mureş Court of Appeal, which, on 16 May 2001, decided to send the case back for a new retrial on the merits.', '18.  Between 23 October 2001 and 17 September 2002, the Mureş County Court adjourned the proceedings eleven times on account of the absence of the applicants’ lawyers on three occasions, pending the summoning of several witnesses requested by the applicants on one occasion and by the prosecutor during the rest of the hearings.', '19.  On 15 October 2002 the County Court heard submissions by the parties on the prosecutor’s request for a change of the legal classification from a crime defined in Article 183 into a crime defined in Articles 174‑176 (a) of the Criminal Code. The court further decided to adjourn the proceedings in order to allow the applicants to submit written observations on the issue.', '20.  At an additional hearing on 12 November 2002 the applicants’ representatives again submitted their defence orally, and subsequently made submissions in writing, on the issue of the change of the legal classification of the crimes. The County Court decided to adjourn delivery of the judgment to 22 and subsequently to 29 November 2002.', '21.  By an interlocutory judgment of 29 November 2002 the County Court decided to change the legal classification of the crimes allegedly committed by the applicants to aggravated murder as defined in Articles 174-176 (a) of the Criminal Code and ordered psychiatric assessments of the applicants, as defined by law for persons charged with murder. Three more adjournments were subsequently ordered by the court in the absence of those psychiatric assessments.', '22.  At a hearing on 15 April 2003 the change of legal classification of the charges against the applicants was again discussed in the presence of all the parties before the court. Delivery of the judgment was adjourned to 22 April 2003.', '23.  On 22 April 2003 the Mureş County Court decided to change back the legal classification of the crimes and convicted the applicants of inflicting grievous bodily harm causing the death of the victim, as defined in Article 183 of the Criminal Code, and trespassing. The three-year sentence was upheld. The amount of the civil damages was increased. The rest of the provisions of the judgment of the Mureş County Court of 10 December 1999 remained unchanged.', '24.

At a hearing on 14 January 2005 before the Court of Appeal the parties made submissions on the prosecutor’s reasons for appeal, namely the request for a reclassification of the crimes committed by the applicants. The applicants’ lawyers requested the court reject the request as it was not supported by evidence and it was obvious from the body of evidence collected that the applicants had not intended to take the life of the victim. The Court of Appeal decided to adjourn the delivery of the judgment first to 26 January and subsequently to 28 January 2005, in order for the applicants’ lawyers to submit written observations.', '29.  On 28 January 2005 the Târgu Mureş Court of Appeal decided to reopen the proceedings on the merits of the appeal since no consensus could be reached between the three judges sitting on the case.', '30.  On 8 April 2005 the Court of Appeal again heard the parties’ submissions on the issue of changing the legal classification of the acts committed by the applicants and adjourned delivery of the judgment for ten days.', '31.  On 19 April 2005 the Târgu Mureş Court of Appeal convicted the applicants of the crime of aggravated murder as defined in Articles 174 and 176 (a) of the Criminal Code and sentenced them to sixteen years’ imprisonment.

On 30 April 2003 the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office dismissed the first applicant’s complaint about the abduction of Visita Shokkarov, stating that Visita Shokkarov had been lawfully arrested in connection with criminal case no. 65034 (it appears that the investigators confused Visita Shokkarov with his brother Visadi). They also noted that “the military prosecutor’s office had opened an investigation into V.V. Shokkarov’s death” and that the applicant had been informed about its outcome.', '55.  On 7 August 2003 the Ingushetia prosecutor’s office informed the applicants’ representatives that on 6 January 2003 the ROVD police officers had arrested Visita Shokkarov along with his brother Visadi and that on the same date, 6 January 2003, the Shokkarov brothers had been handed over to the investigator of the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office, Mr V.P., and the servicemen of the Nadterechniy ROVD from Chechnya, and that the subsequent whereabouts of the brothers were unknown to the Ingushetia prosecutor’s office (see paragraph 33 above).', '56.  On 9 August 2003 the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office instituted an investigation into Visita Shokkarov’s disappearance under Article 126 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code (kidnapping). The case was assigned no. 46037. The applicants were informed of the decision on 14 August 2003.', '57.  On 19 August 2003 the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office granted the third applicant victim status in the criminal case. The decision stated that on 6 January 2003 Visita Shokkarov had been arrested along with his brother Visadi and taken to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD and subsequently to the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechniy district, and released the following day. However, Visita Shokkarov had not returned home and had gone missing.', '58.  On 27 September 2004 the Chechnya prosecutor’s office informed the third applicant that an investigation into Visita Shokkarov’s abduction was under way.', '59.  On an unspecified date the third applicant complained about the disappearance of Visita Shokkarov to the Mozdok district prosecutor’s office in North Ossetia. On 16 June 2003 the office informed her that Visita had not been detained in the Mozdok ROVD.', '60.  On 7 June 2003 the third applicant complained to the Envoy about the abduction of Visita Shokkarov. On 1 July 2003 this complaint was forwarded to the Chechnya prosecutor’s office and on 1 August 2003 it was received by the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office.', '61.  On an unspecified date the Mozdok forensic bureau informed the investigators that on 3 February 2003 an investigator from the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office had brought Visadi Shokkarov’s corpse to the morgue and requested the third applicant to collect it. It appears that the investigator had been confused and instead of stating that the corpse belonged to Visadi Shokkarov he had stated that it had belonged to Visita Shokkarov.\\n(b)  Official investigation of Visita Shokkarov’s disappearance', '62.  On 9 August 2003 the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 46037 (also referred to as no. 54043) under Article 126 § 1 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping) in connection with the abduction of Visita Shokkarov from Ordzhenikidzovskaya on 6 January 2003.', '63.  On 19 August 2003 the investigators granted the third applicant victim status in the criminal case and questioned her. The applicant stated that on 6 January 2003 her relative Visadi Shokkarov and another man had been taken from the camp in Ordzhenikidzovskaya by armed masked men to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD in Ingushetia. After that she, her husband Visita and other relatives had gone to the ROVD to find out the reasons for Visadi’s arrest. Near the ROVD her husband Visita had been approached by two men, who had come out of the ROVD building. They had taken Visita into the police station. The applicant had attempted to follow Visita, but she had been stopped at the entrance by the deputy head of the ROVD, Mr I.M., who had told her that Visita had been taken in for questioning and would be released shortly afterwards. The applicant had seen through a crack in the fence that her husband Visita and his brother Visadi had been put by police officers into a UAZ car and after that the car had driven away. After that the ROVD policemen had told her that Visita had been taken from the ROVD to Znamenskoye, in the Nadterechniy district, Chechnya, by representatives of the Chechnya FSB. On the seventh day after Visita’s abduction, the applicant and her relatives had gone to Znamenskoye, where the investigator of the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office Mr V.P. had informed her, having been in touch with the local branch of the FSB, that on the third day after the arrest Visita Shokkarov had been released from the FSB and apparently had gone home. After that the applicant had requested information concerning Visita’s whereabouts at the Nadterechniy ROVD, where she had been informed that he had not been detained there.', '64.  On 21 August 2003 the investigators forwarded a number of information requests to various law-enforcement agencies in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan and the Stavropol region, asking for any information concerning Visita Shokkarov’s whereabouts. No pertinent information was received as a result.', '65.  On 25 August 2003 the investigators questioned the first applicant, who stated that on 6 January 2003 officers of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD had arrived in three UAZ vehicles and taken away his son Visadi Shokkarov. Immediately after that the applicant and his relatives had gone to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD, where the head of the ROVD had told him that Visadi had been suspected of murdering an official from the Nadterechniy district administration. Later that day, when the applicant had returned to the ROVD, he had seen the third applicant, who had been crying and waiting next to the police station. She had told him that the police officers had taken away her husband Visita. One of them, a certain “Magomed”, had told her that the police would soon release her husband. At about 4 p.m. on the same date, 6 January 2003, three UAZ cars had left the courtyard of the ROVD and driven away to an unknown destination. After that the head of the ROVD had told the applicant and his relatives that the Shokkarov brothers had been taken by investigator Mr V.P. from the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office to the village of Znamenskoye in Chechnya. On 8 January 2003 the applicant had been informed by the Nadterechniy FSB that he could bring food and warm clothing for his detained sons. The applicant had brought some food and passed it on to the FSB officers. About five days later the third applicant had gone to Znamenskoye, where she had been told that Visita Shokkarov had been released three days after the arrest and that Visadi Shokkarov had continued to be detained on suspicion of killing the official.', '66.  On an unspecified date the Nadterechniy FSB informed the investigators that it had not arrested or detained Visita Shokkarov and that he had not been listed as a member of any illegal armed groups.', '67.  On 28 August 2003 the investigators questioned the investigator of the Nadterechniy prosecutor’s office Mr V.P., who stated he could not recall the relevant details of the criminal investigation owing to the passing of time, but stated that he had requested the local court to remand Visadi Shokkarov in custody and that he could not recall whether one or both brothers had been detained.', '68.  On 3 April 2006 (in the documents submitted the date was also indicated as 10 March 2008) the investigators questioned police officer S.G. of the Nadterechniy ROVD, who stated that Visita Shokkarov had not been brought to the ROVD and that the police had not conducted any checks in respect of him.', '69.  On 7 and 11 or 12 April 2006 the investigators questioned Mr V.Tch. and Mr Kh.T., both of whom had been officers of the Nadterechniy ROVD at the material time. Their statements were similar to the one given by officer S.G.', '70.  On 12 April 2006 (in the documents submitted the date was also indicated as 24 March 2006) the investigators examined the registration log of detainees in the Nadterechniy ROVD for the period between 31 October 2002 and 3 July 2003. As a result, it was established that during this period Visita Shokkarov had not been detained in the ROVD.', '71.  On 20 April 2006 the investigators suspended the investigation in the criminal case owing to the failure to identify those responsible for Visita Shokkarov’s abduction. The third applicant was informed of that decision.', '72.  On 27 February 2008 the decision to suspend the investigation was overruled by the supervising prosecutor and the proceedings in the criminal case were resumed.', '73.  On 28 March 2008 the Nadterechniy ROVD informed the investigators that they had not arrested or detained the Shokkarov brothers.', '74.  On 19 May 2008 the Nadterechniy department of the FSB informed the investigators that no special operations had been conducted against the Shokkarov brothers in Ingushetia.', '75.  Despite specific request by the Court the Government did not disclose most of the contents of the criminal case files opened in connection with the death of Visadi Shokkarov and the abduction of Visita Shokkarov. The Government provided copies of documents from the criminal case files running to 561 pages; the vast majority of the documents concerned third persons and only a few were relevant to the applicants’ complaints. The Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the other documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information concerning witnesses or other participants in criminal proceedings.'], 'applicants': ['SHOKKAROV', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '2'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '2', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '28', '33', '37', '38', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '57', '63', '65', '68', '70', '73', '74', '75'], '3': ['15', '21', '28', '35', '43'], '5': ['31']}, 'silver_rationales': [9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 57, 59, 62, 64, 67, 68, 69], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 57, 59, 62, 64, 67, 68, 69], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 2, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 43, 51, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 44, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 37, 36, 34, 68, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 35, 27, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 26, 69], 'explained_distances': [0.8654436, 0.63144946, 0.164164, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195, 0.04335195], 'number_of_sentences': 70, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

They were living in Halitpınar village at the time of the alleged events giving rise to the present application. The facts of the case are in dispute between the parties and may be summarised as follows.', '10.  Until October 1994 the applicants all lived in Halitpınar, a village of Ovacık district in Tunceli province, in the then state-of-emergency region of Turkey. In 1994, terrorist activity was a major concern in this area. Since the 1980s a violent conflict had been going on in the region between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan). The inhabitants of the applicants’ village were suspected of “aiding and abetting terrorists”; and accordingly they were strictly and frequently controlled by the gendarmes stationed near the village.', '11.  On 4 October 1994 security forces surrounded Halitpınar and assembled the inhabitants in the village square. Using curse words, they told the villagers that the village would be evacuated at once with no possibility of return. The applicants took what they were able to carry with them and left the village. Immediately after the evacuation, the soldiers set the houses and the crops on fire.', '12.  The applicants moved temporarily into a prefabricated State disaster housing complex close to Ovacık.', '13.  Following the incident, the applicants filed individual petitions with the Ovacık Public Prosecutor’s office complaining about the burning down of their village by gendarmes. The applicants noted their temporary addresses as the reply address for their petitions.', '14.  As the case concerned an investigation into alleged acts of the security forces, the Ovacık Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non‑jurisdiction and referred the petitions to the office of the District Governor in Ovacık in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakematı Kanunu).', '15.  The District Governor sent a letter to the Ovacık Gendarmerie Headquarters and requested information about the applicants’ allegations.', '16.  In a letter of 1 November 1994 the Gendarmerie Commander informed the District Governor that the security forces had not burned any house during their operations in the area. Accordingly, the Ovacık Administrative Council issued a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the gendarmes.', '17.  On 25 October 1995 the Ovacık District Governor sent a letter to the applicants. Relying on the Ovacık Gendarmerie Commander’s letter of 1 November 1994, he explained that he was unconvinced by their allegations. He further explained that pursuant to the established case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court (Danıştay), no inquiry was possible unless the identity of the accused civil servant were specified. He therefore stated that the authorities would not initiate an investigation into the alleged events.', '18.  The applicants did not receive this letter. They learned about the Ovacık Public Prosecutor’s decision of non-jurisdiction and the Ovacık Administrative Council’s decision from their fellow villagers and acquaintances at a much later stage.', '19.  In 1994 members of the PKK started a propaganda campaign for the organisation in the villages of Ovacık district. They kidnapped young men from these villages and forced them to join the organisation. The PKK militants issued threats against the villagers and harassed them. The inhabitants of the villages left their homes as a result of the pressure exerted by the PKK.', '20.  The investigation carried out by the authorities revealed that the applicants’ houses had not been burned by the security forces but by terrorists wearing military uniforms. In their statements to the investigating authorities, the applicants failed to indicate the identity of the perpetrators of the alleged crime.', '21.  The parties submitted various documents with a view to substantiating their claims. These documents, in so far as they are relevant, can be summarised as follows.', '22.  The Human Rights Foundation is a non-governmental organisation with its head office in Ankara, Turkey. Its 1993 Report stated that, from 1990 to 1993, more than 913 villages and hamlets had been evacuated. The 1993 Report maintained that village evacuations had accelerated in 1993, mostly targeting the villages whose inhabitants refused to serve as village guards.', '23.  The 1994 Report of the TIHV argued that the Government’s policy was to claim that the evacuations and eventual destructions were caused by PKK terror, poverty and the forces of nature. According to the same report, some 50 to 60 villages were burned down in each of the provinces subject to the emergency rule.', '24.  The 1995 Report maintained that more than 400 villages had been evacuated in 1995. According to the 1996 Report, the State-of-Emergency Regional Governor once mentioned that a total of 918 villages and 1,767 hamlets had been evacuated for various reasons, although never admitting that evacuations had been carried out by security forces.', '25.  The 1997 and 1998 Reports described the Government’s policy of evacuating villages as a systematic “internal security operation” applied throughout the 1990s.\\n(b)  Excerpts from “Burned-down / Evacuated Villages and Migration”, a book published by the Human Rights Association', '26. The excerpts gave a comprehensive list of burned-down and/or evacuated villages from February 1990 to January 1999. The list did not make any reference to Halitpınar as having been evacuated and destroyed.', '27.  The excerpts contained several articles reproduced from a daily newspaper Ülkede Gündem, relating to the evacuation of villages and its detrimental effects on the displaced persons. The articles stressed that numerous villagers had filed petitions with the State authorities, complaining that their villages had been burned down by security forces.', '28.  The articles also emphasized that the Government’s public declarations, which appeared to allow displaced villagers to return to their villages, were unreliable. Whenever villagers had attempted to do so, they were physically denied access to their villages.\\n(c)  The report of 14 January 1998 of the Turkish Grand National Assembly’s Commission of Inquiry on the measures to be taken in order to address the problems of the persons displaced following the evacuation of settlement units in east and south-east Anatolia', '29.  This report was prepared by a Commission of Inquiry composed of ten members of parliament. According to the report, in 1993 and 1994 the inhabitants of 905 villages and 2,923 hamlets were evicted and forced to move to other regions of the country (p.13).', '30.  The report included a statement by Mr Doğan Hatipoğlu, a former governor of Diyarbakır. Mr Hatipoğlu explained that, during his office, occasional village evacuations by military authorities were brought to his attention. He stated that – although very rarely – he had received complaints about village burnings. According to Mr Hatipoğlu, it was inconceivable to assert that all the villages were vacated due to PKK coercion. He alleged that the Government had failed to take the necessary measures for a healthy resettlement of displaced persons (p.13).', '31.  The report also referred to the “Human Rights Report – Turkey”, prepared and submitted to the Commission of Inquiry in 1995 by Mr Yavuz Önen, the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation. This latter report dedicated a chapter to immigrants and evacuated villages. It argued that, in 1995, the practice of evacuation of villages and hamlets was widespread. Many houses in villages were either destroyed or made uninhabitable. People were forced to emigrate from the region and pressure was exerted on the inhabitants until they left their villages. In early 1995 there was practically no village or hamlet inhabited except those whose inhabitants agreed to become village guards (p.19).', '32.  The report of the Commission of Inquiry also referred to the speech delivered at the Turkish Grand National Assembly by Mr Salih Yıldırım, a deputy from Şırnak, on 3 June 1997 on the question of evacuated villages. Mr Yıldırım stated, inter alia, that the villages were evacuated either by the PKK, in order to intimidate those who opposed it, by the authorities since they were unable to protect the villages, or because the inhabitants of those villages refused to become village guards or were suspected of having aided the PKK (p. 20).', '33.  In conclusion, it was recommended in the report that the inhabitants of the settlement units should be re-housed in the provinces, districts or central villages – rather than hamlets – close to the area where they used to live and that necessary economic measures should be taken with a view to providing employment to the inhabitants of the region, priority being given to the immigrants.', '34.  This report aims at establishing the property owned by each of the applicants. Having regard to the registers of the land registry office and municipality registry office, it appears that Abbas Öztoprak did not own any property. He was not subscribed to TEDAŞ, meaning that he did not have electricity at home. However, he receives pension from the State. It further appeared that Mr Öztoprak owned a “green card” given to very poor people for medical care and that he received TRL 75,000,000 in aid from the Ovacık District Governor’s office.', '35.  Mehmet Öztoprak owned 8,000 square metres of land according to the land registry records. It was estimated that he could derive TRL 128,000,000’s annual income at the relevant time. Mr Öztoprak owned a “green card” given to very poor people for medical care. The Ovacık District Governor’s office gave him 11 sheep, TRL 195,000,000 and food in aid for his living. Between 1994 and 2002 Mr Öztoprak lived in a house in the disaster houses complex provided by the Government. In 2002 he moved into a house which was built within the context of “return to village and rehabilitation project”.', '36.  Şahin Toprak did not own any property according to the land registry records. But he owned a 60 square metres, a house and a stable as well as land measuring 14,000 square metres according to his declaration of 9 June 1994 to the municipality registration office. It was estimated that he could derive TRL 224,000,000’s annual income at the relevant time. Since 24 April 1993 he is the holder of a “green card” given to very poor people for medical care. Mr Toprak received food and TRL 125,000,000’s in aid from the Ovacık District Governor’s office. Furthermore, he lived in a house in the disaster houses complex provided by the Government. In 2002 he moved into a house which was built within the context of “return to village and rehabilitation project”.\\n(b)  Veys Toprak’s statements dated 10 March 2004, taken by two gendarme officers', '37.  The witness is a former resident of Halitpınar village. He is currently the mayor of Kandolar neighbourhood in Ovacık. His statements were taken in order to determine the situation of the applicants who had lodged an application with the Court. The witness stated that between 1994 and 2002 the applicants had lived in prefabricated houses in Kandolar neighbourhood of Ovacık. In 2002 they had moved into new houses built by the Government. At the relevant time nobody lived in Halitpınar. There was no electricity, school or telephone in the village.\\n(c)  Letter of 1 November 1994 from the Ovacık District Gendarme Commander to the Chief Public Prosecutor’s office in Ovacık', '38.  Gendarme Major Yüksel Sönmez informed the Chief Public Prosecutor that the houses belonging to Reis Toprak, Kamber Çelik, Veli Çelik and Süleyman Toprak in Halitpınar village and in Toprak hamlet had been burned down by terrorists wearing military uniforms. In his opinion, the terrorists aimed at pacifying the security forces and creating hostility between the latter and the people in the region.\\n(d)  Investigation report of 4 June 1995, prepared by police superintendent Bahri Üstüner', '39.  Following an investigation conducted into the allegations that State security forces had burned down houses in Halitpınar village, the inspector established that the houses had not been burned down by the security forces but by terrorists wearing military uniforms. The terrorists had further forced the villagers to complain to the authorities that their houses had been burned down by the security forces. The inspector also noted that the security forces had been conducting operations in the region with a view to maintaining the security of the people and that therefore they would not burn villages or give damage to property.'], 'applicants': ['ÖZTOPRAK', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['14', '5', '13', '3', '8', '18', '6', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['15', '17', '53', '55'], '41': ['55', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 8], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 8], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 7, 6, 3, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 26, 27, 20, 25, 19, 15, 17, 16, 29, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 18, 30, 8], 'explained_distances': [0.3119802, 0.084367216, 0.046642393, 0.045523435, 0.04420781, 0.025975376, 0.014222413, -0.0036811233, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.057665825, -0.060843468], 'number_of_sentences': 31, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Amsterdam.', '7.  In 1967 her parents built a holiday home without planning permission on land situated in Zutendaal (Belgium). According to the applicant, however, the house was built in 1962.', '8.  Following her mother’s death, a deed of partition was drawn up on 6 January 1986 between the applicant (who, inheriting from her mother, became the remainderman of half of the property) and her father. That deed, which specifically mentions the existence of the building, was registered with the Mortgage Registrar at the Ministry of Finance and a registration fee was paid.', '9.  The applicant’s father died on 21 August 1993 and she became the full and sole owner of the entire property. On inheriting the property, the applicant specifically declared in the notarised deed of distribution that the plot was a holiday home. The deeds were registered with the local authorities and the applicant paid the inheritance tax. From then on, the applicant paid an annual property tax (précompte immobilier) and second‑residence tax on the holiday home. According to the applicant, it went without saying that her father had also paid the relevant taxes on the house.', '10.  The applicant carried out renovations on the house costing 50,000 euros (EUR) and had the trees on the adjoining land felled.', '11.  In 1994 the partly government-controlled Flemish water-supply company carried out works to connect the house to the drainage and water-supply systems. There was no reaction from the local authorities at that time.', '12.  On 27 January 1994 a report was drawn up by a police officer who noted that trees had been felled on the property in breach of Article 81, paragraph 3, of the Flemish forestry decree of 13 June 1990.', '13.  On 22 February 1994 a report was drawn up by a police officer who noted that the holiday home had been erected in 1967 without planning permission and that it was located in a forested area in which no such permission could be issued. The report also noted that the exterior and roof of the house had been renovated.', '14.  On 8 August 1994 the applicant voluntarily reported to the police to make a statement, which was placed on record.', '15.  By a decision of 11 October 1994, the municipal council (collège des bourgmestre et échevins) asked the planning inspector to issue an opinion on any remedial action to be taken. By a letter of 19 June 1995, the planning inspector applied to the public prosecutor for the site to be restored to its original condition.', '16.   Two reports dated 26 March 1996 and 8 January 1997 mention that the police had sought to question the applicant again but had found it difficult to contact her and that she was temporarily unable to travel for health reasons.', '17.  At the request of the Tongeren public prosecutor, the applicant was questioned in Amsterdam on 25 March 1997 by a Dutch police officer. A report was drawn up on that occasion.', '18.  On 18 May 1998 the public prosecutor asked the local police to confirm whether or not the building in issue still existed.', '19.  A report of 16 June 1998 established that the situation had not changed.', '20.  The Tongeren public prosecutor issued the applicant with a summons to appear in court on 12 May 1999, firstly, for having maintained a holiday home, erected without planning permission, between 27 January 1994 and 28 April 1999 and, secondly, for having felled approximately fifty pine trees in breach of the above-mentioned Flemish forestry decree. According to the applicant, there were at least four other houses built without permission in the same forested areas, which had neither been the subject of reports establishing that an offence had been committed nor of prosecution.', '21.  On 25 June 1999 the Tongeren Criminal Court issued an interlocutory judgment in absentia, since the applicant had not been duly summoned.', '22.  On 6 January 2000 she was once again summoned to appear before the Tongeren Criminal Court.', '23.  On 26 May 2000 that court acquitted the applicant of the above-mentioned charges. It held in particular that after twenty-seven years the applicant could legitimately assume, as could any reasonably prudent citizen, that maintaining the building in issue would no longer constitute an offence. The court further held that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the planning inspector’s application to have the land restored to its original condition. The prosecutor appealed.', '24.  By a judgment of 6 February 2002, the Antwerp Court of Appeal upheld the judgment in so far as the applicant was acquitted of the charge of felling the trees. However, it found her guilty of maintaining a building erected without planning permission, pursuant to Article 146 of the town and country planning decree of 18 May 1999, and changed the impugned period to between 22 August 1993 and 28 April 1999, having regard to the date on which the applicant’s father had died.', '25.  In her submissions the applicant had alleged a violation of the reasonable-time requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, considering that the criminal proceedings had been conducted beyond that time-limit and that after such a long period there had been an interference with her rights of defence, in particular since it had been impossible for her to prove that the house had been built before 1962. She had also criticised the failure of the authorities to act, pointing out that her parents had paid the second-residence tax, that a notarised deed mentioning the building had been registered by the authorities, that she had paid inheritance tax on property that included the building, that extensive infrastructure works had been carried out by a partly government-controlled company with no reaction on the part of the local authorities and that for many years no legal action had been taken. She had also alleged a violation of the principle of protection of the legitimate expectations of citizens and complained of discrimination in comparison with neighbouring property owners.', '26.  The Court of Appeal found that a deed of partition drawn up in 1986 and signed by the applicant established that the holiday home had been built in 1967 and concurred furthermore with the findings contained in the report drawn up on 22 February 1994. The Court of Appeal considered that the applicant knew or should have known that the building had been erected without planning permission. As a reasonable and prudent citizen, and even taking account of the attitude of the authorities as she had described it, the applicant could not have inferred that the situation was totally legal and that no proceedings would be brought against her. The Court of Appeal found that the applicant had acted most imprudently by proceeding to renovate the premises after the death of her father. It also found that the fact that four other dwellings had also been erected in the same forested area without planning permission and without their owners being prosecuted did not amount to discrimination.', '27.  With regard, more particularly, to compliance with the reasonable-time requirement, the Court of Appeal found that the length of the criminal proceedings had been unreasonable but that this did not alter the fact that the offence had been established and that the applicant had, since 1994, been liable to prosecution. Considering, firstly, that overrunning the reasonable time did not cause the proceedings to become time-barred and, secondly, that account should be taken of the specific circumstances of the case, and in particular of the fact that the applicant had no criminal record, the Court of Appeal merely pronounced a finding of guilt against the applicant.', '28.  Referring to the planning inspector’s application lodged pursuant to Articles 149 et seq. of the above-mentioned decree of 18 May 1999, which it deemed to be reasonable, the Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to restore the site to its former condition and to demolish the building within one year of the judgment becoming final, with a fine of EUR 125 per day’s delay. It also authorised the municipal council or the planning inspector to enforce the order at the expense of the applicant in the event of non-compliance with the demolition order. The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings.', '29.  The applicant appealed on points of law.', '30.  By a judgment of 7 January 2003, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal.', '31.  On grounds based on a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the applicant claimed that the length of the criminal proceedings had been unreasonable and it could therefore be concluded that they were time-barred.', '32.  The Court of Cassation held that exceeding a reasonable time did not cause criminal proceedings to become time-barred and that, consequently, the Court of Appeal had not been bound to base its decision on that point.', '33.  The applicant also submitted that, bearing in mind that the Court of Appeal had merely pronounced a finding of guilt against her, she could not be bound to restore the site to its original condition or to pay the costs of the proceedings.', '34.  The Court of Cassation responded that restoration of the site to its original condition did not constitute a penalty but a civil measure, in the same way as the payment of the full costs of the proceedings at the fixed rate, and that consequently these measures were not inconsistent with a simple finding of guilt.', '35.  The court also dismissed the ground based on Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 whereby the applicant alleged that after a thirty-year period during which they had tolerated the situation, thus creating an apparently lawful situation, the authorities could no longer rely on the public interest to justify interference with the peaceful enjoyment of her property rights and respect for her private life.', '36.  The Court of Cassation found that the Court of Appeal had held, in its unfettered discretion, that the applicant had been most imprudent in maintaining the house without planning permission, that the measure sought by the planning inspector was reasonable and that, consequently, that ground of appeal was inadmissible.', '37.  The house was demolished in July 2004 pursuant to an enforcement order. According to an expert, the value of the house at the material time was EUR 62,635. The demolition costs amounted to EUR 3,025.'], 'applicants': ['HAMER'], 'defendants': ['BELGIUM'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['14', 'P1-1', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['38'], 'P1-1': ['11', '38', '41', '8', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 5], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 5], 'explained_indices': [15, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 31, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 30, 0, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2, 7, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, 0.00045552105, -0.025543973, -0.07051765, -0.071705736, -0.11508507, -0.14431322, -0.18080565, -0.2771682, -0.2821046], 'number_of_sentences': 32, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Chişinău.', '6.  At the time of the events the applicant was the head of a private high school (V.) and acting head of the Industrial and Construction College (C., a State-funded institution). In 2004 a criminal investigation was opened into fraudulent acts and abuse of power allegedly committed by the applicant. He was accused of having accepted money from two students for their studies at V. and failing to disclose those payments in the school’s accounts.', '7.  On 24 September 2004 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on the basis of a warrant issued by the Centru District Court that day. On 30 September 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s decision, finding there was no reason to believe that the applicant would abscond or interfere with the investigation, noting that he had a fixed address, a family and an under-age child, and that he had undertaken to appear before the investigation authorities whenever summoned. He was released on the same day.', '8.  On 20 November 2006 the Grigoriopol District Court sentenced the applicant to three years’ imprisonment for fraud. He was acquitted of all the other charges mainly owing to a lack of evidence that he had illegally accepted money from the students. On the same day he was arrested and placed in prison no. 13 in Chișinău.', '9.  On 8 February 2007 the Chişinău Court of Appeal partly quashed the first-instance court’s judgment. The court found that the applicant had been negligent in admitting two new students to V. and accepting tuition fees from them, even though by order of 25 December 2003, the Ministry of Education had suspended V’s licence and the applicant had been ordered to transfer all pupils to other educational institutions. The applicant was thus convicted under Article 329 (1) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below) and his custodial sentence was reduced by the appellate court to eight months.', '10.  In an appeal on points of law, the applicant argued that he could not be convicted of a violation of Article 329 (1) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below) because two elements of the crime set out therein had not been met, namely that it had to have been committed by a “public official” and that the damage caused as a result had to be “large-scale”. Firstly, the conviction had been based on his alleged wrongdoing as head of V. As the head of a private institution, he could not be considered a public official (persoană cu funcţii de răspundere), a notion expressly defined in Article 123 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below). He could not therefore be accused of negligence in carrying out any official duties by accepting pupils to study in his private school.\\nSecondly, the value of the alleged damage caused (3,020 Moldovan lei (MDL)) was less than the minimum MDL 10,000 required under Article 329 for large-scale damage, as defined in Articles 64 and 126 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below).\\nFinally, the applicant argued that he had admitted new pupils to his school because he had challenged the Ministry of Justice’s order of 25 December 2003 in court, which in his opinion meant that the order had been suspended and thus had no legal effect pending the outcome of the litigation.', '11.  On 28 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice partly quashed the lower court’s judgment. The court dealt with the applicant’s arguments raised in his appeal on points of law as follows:\\n“As concerns [the applicant’s] arguments that he must be acquitted under Article 329 (1) of the Criminal Code because the elements of the crime were not present in his actions, these [arguments] are unsubstantiated and are contradicted by the material evidence; the accused’s refusal to admit liability should not necessarily lead to his acquittal since there is pertinent and conclusive evidence which corroborates as a whole and proves with certainty his guilt in having committed the crime: contract no. ... of enrolling S.N. as a student ... concluded between L.G. and the head of [V.]; receipts for [cashing of] MDL 2,000 lei on 30 August 2004 and of MDL 1,000 and MDL 20 on 6 July 2004; [Ministry of Education] order of 25 December 2003 suspending the activity of the private education institutions founded by [V.].”\\nThe court noted, however, that the lower courts had not taken into consideration the applicant’s mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that he had no previous convictions and was well regarded in society. In the absence of any aggravating circumstances, the lower courts had incorrectly decided to imprison him. The court therefore ordered the applicant to pay a fine instead of giving him a custodial sentence. He was therefore released on the same day, after approximately seven months of detention in prison no. 13. Taking into account the fact that he had already served time in prison, he was dispensed from paying the fine.', '12.  The applicant described the conditions in which he had been held for more than seven months in Chişinău Prison no. 13. The prison was situated in a 165-year-old building. He was detained in a cell measuring 26 square metres which he shared with between eleven and fourteen other detainees. The cell was unventilated, the only air coming in from several holes in a net covering the window. The cell was very cold in winter and very hot in summer, the walls and ceiling were damp and the toilet was not separated from the rest of the cell. During the first five months of detention, the applicant was not issued with any bedding and had to sleep on a bare mattress. When bedding was finally provided, it was changed very rarely. The cell was never cleaned; his mattress was full of parasitic insects and he could not sleep as a result. The light was too weak in the cell for reading. Showers were only allowed once a week and the shower day did not coincide with the day of the week when fresh bedding was issued, which meant the continuous presence of parasitic insects. Food was inadequate and of poor quality; the portions did not conform to the standard decided upon by the Government, particularly in respect of meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.', '13.  The applicant made a total of forty-four complaints to various authorities about the conditions of his detention. He asked, inter alia, for the number of persons in cell no. 75 (in which he was being detained) to be reduced to no more than eight detainees instead of the fourteen who were held there at the time of making the complaint, so as to observe the statutory minimum requirement of 4 square metres of living space per detainee. The applicant also asked for an additional hour of exercise time for all the detainees in his cell in an attempt to improve the overcrowding situation. The applicant made six complaints between 19 March and 15 May 2007 about the lack of ventilation and access to fresh air aggravating the overcrowding. On 25 March 2007 he asked to be transferred to a non-smoking cell because he was subjected to passive smoking, which he argued was “a far more serious punishment than the eight months of imprisonment to which [he] had been sentenced”. On 3 May 2007 he complained about the failure to provide adequate food as required by the relevant Government decisions, claiming, inter alia, that reduced quantities of sugar and bread had been distributed to detainees in his cell. The applicant asked for portion sizes to be checked periodically to ensure they were meeting the statutory minimum. On four occasions between 30 March and 28 May 2007 the applicant complained about the presence of parasitic insects and asked for fresh bedding to coincide with shower day so as to avoid the risk of continued infestation. On 12 May 2007 the applicant asked for various materials in order to carry out repairs to their cell (together with his cell mates), as the ceiling was dark and the paint was peeling off the walls.', '14.  The applicant received a total of five letters in response, informing him that he would only be transferred to another category of prison following the final determination of his criminal case. The responses, however, failed to address the majority of his complaints. The applicant stated that on 17 May 2007, after repeatedly complaining about the unventilated space, a window was opened in the corridor opposite his cell, providing more fresh air. On 7 June 2007, in reply to his request to be allowed to use the prison library’s reading room, he was informed by the relevant authorities that prison no. 13 had no such facility.', '15.  On 19 February and 26 March 2007 the applicant complained that he was being detained in a closed prison, despite having been sentenced to detention in a semi-open prison where, he submitted, he would have had a right to move freely within the prison area (as opposed to having one hour of exercise time in the closed prison).', '16.  On 2 July 2007 the prison doctor examined the applicant and informed him that he had been exposed to the risk of contracting tuberculosis. The doctor referred the applicant to a consultant and an eyesight specialist.'], 'applicants': ['MITROFAN'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', '3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '13', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['12', '13', '14', '21', '26'], '6': ['10', '19', '20', '45'], '13': ['31', '32', '33']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 7, 8, 9], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 7, 8, 9], 'explained_indices': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 5, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2], 'explained_distances': [-0.05776906, -0.05776906, -0.05776906, -0.05776906, -0.05776906, -0.05776906, -0.12058085, -0.17543653, -0.3027515, -0.35251126, -0.40042374, -0.5630591], 'number_of_sentences': 12, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 22 April 1994 the Commission upheld the application and recognised the applicant’s property rights over two villas and a three-storey building measuring 1,380 sq. m and a plot of land measuring 540 sq. m.', '9.  As regards the three-storey building and one of the villas, the Commission decided to return the property to the applicant. As regards the other villa, the Commission recognised the applicant’s co-ownership with its existing occupier. However, as it was impossible to allocate the original plot of land measuring 540 sq. m to the applicant, the Commission ordered the payment of compensation in State bonds equivalent to the value of the plot. Lastly, the Commission ordered the authorities to enforce the decision.', '10.

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Rouse.', '10.  In 1976 the applicant started working for the Cargo Railway Station in Rouse and until 1989 she formally occupied the positions of dormitories supervisor and facilities and social activities co‑ordinator. In fact, throughout this period the applicant was working – under the instructions of her manager – as a typist at the local section of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This scheme had apparently been devised because the staff tables did not provide for a typist position.', \"11.  Accordingly, the applicant's employment agreements and job descriptions did not mention her actual duties, which included mostly typewriting. This arrangement was apparently never called into question by the applicant or her employer.\", '12.  Between 1989 and 1996 the applicant worked as an inspector at the human resources department of the Station.', \"13.  In late December 1995 or in early January 1996 the applicant's employer, acting pursuant to a medical recommendation on the nature of work she was fit to perform, moved her to a different position – internal mail carrier.\", '14.  In 1979 the applicant started experiencing pain in her hands and arms. Initially she was losing the sensitivity in her fingers and could not hold objects. With the passage of time the pain got stronger and her hands started to swell and tremble, especially after long periods of typing.', \"15.  In December 1994 the applicant was examined by the Diagnostic Expert Commission (“the DEC”) at the Rouse Regional Hospital. In a decision of 15 December 1994 the DEC found that the applicant was suffering from vegetative polyneuropathy of the upper limbs, a disease which features on the Table of Occupational Diseases. However, the DEC, relying solely on the applicant's job descriptions, concluded that the positions she had occupied (dormitories supervisor, facilities and social activities co‑ordinator) did not entail increased strain on her upper limbs. Accordingly, it qualified her disease as non-occupational, finding no causal link between the conditions of work and the disease. Apparently the DEC refused to examine evidence (including affidavits) submitted by the applicant to prove her actual duties.\", '16.  The applicant appealed to the Central Diagnostic Expert Commission (“the CDEC”), arguing that her de facto duties were different from the ones enumerated in her job descriptions. As no witness testimony was admissible, she again submitted affidavits from her managers to the effect that she had actually worked as a typist. On 15 March 1995 the CDEC dismissed the appeal, fully endorsing the reasons of the DEC. Apparently it refused to take into account any other evidence purporting to establish the actual duties of the applicant.', '17.  In October 1995 the applicant was admitted for treatment at the Medical Institute for Transport Workers in Sofia. On 19 December 1995 the DEC at the Institute examined the applicant and found that she suffered from osteohondrosis cervicalis. It also reached the conclusion that the disease was not an occupational one, being unrelated to the duties of the applicant as set out in her job descriptions.', \"18.  The applicant appealed against this decision to the CDEC. By a decision of 13 February 1996 it upheld the ruling as to the non-occupational character of the applicant's disease and fully endorsed the DEC's reasons.\", '19.  On 19 March 1996 the applicant brought an action against her employer under Article 200 of the Labour Code of 1986. She alleged that the disease of her hands had developed as a result of her work. In fact, between 1976 and 1989 she had worked as a typist, even though her job descriptions did not reflect that. The rulings of the DEC and the CDEC that her disease was not work‑related were based solely on these job descriptions; the commissions had not inquired into the reality of the situation. She requested the court to summon witnesses to testify about her real duties and to appoint an expert to establish the occupational character of her disease.', '20.  Two witnesses – former managers of the applicant – testified during the trial. They stated that the applicant had in fact worked as a typist, in accordance with the orders of her employer, and provided details about her workload.', \"21.  Two expert witnesses were appointed by the court to give conclusions about the applicant's state of health and about the occupational or non‑occupational character of her disease. The first expert concluded that the applicant was suffering from vegetative neuropathy of the hands. The second expert submitted a report in which she stated that the cause for the applicant's disease could be her conditions of work, as described by her managers. Both experts confirmed their conclusions at a public hearing on 23 October 1996.\", \"22.  The Rouse District Court gave judgment on 30 October 1996, dismissing the applicant's action. It stated, inter alia:\\n“... the court considers the action to be ill-founded. The prerequisites for finding the employer liable under Article 200 of the Labour Code ... are a valid employment agreement and a convincingly established occupational disease. The occupational character of the disease is determined by the special medical commissions ... The existence of a finding [made by the DEC and ascertaining the occupational character of the disease] is an absolute precondition for holding the employer liable under Article 200 of the Labour Code. The specific character of the [subject‑matter of the inquiry] has led the legislature to establish specialised medical bodies to give a conclusion as to the type [of the disease] and as to the causal link between the conditions of work and the disease. In the case at hand the [DEC and the CDEC] have concluded that the [applicant's] disease was not occupational and was not related to her conditions of work ... [T]he court examining the dispute under Article 200 of the Labour Code may rule as to the occupational character of the disease only if no medical documents have been issued by the [DEC].”\", \"23.  The applicant appealed to the Rouse Regional Court. On 27 December 1996 that court upheld the lower court's judgment in the following terms:\\n“The [District Court's] judgment is well-founded. After assessing the collected and relevant evidence, the District Court correctly concluded that the occupational character of the [applicant's] disease, ... which is one of the prerequisites for holding her employer liable under Article 200 of the Labour Code, has not been convincingly established. The first‑instance court has correctly decided that the occupational character of the disease may be established by the court only if no documents have been issued by the specialised medical bodies ... The District Court has taken into account that in the case at hand these bodies have reached the categorical conclusion ... that the disease of the [applicant] was not related to her working conditions and was thus not occupational.”\", \"24.  The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court. That court dismissed the petition in a final judgment of 18 November 1997. It held:\\n“The acts issued by the specialised medical bodies indicate that [the applicant's] disease was not occupational, i.e. no causal link was found between the disease and the working conditions. The expert witnesses' conclusions do not alter this finding. The [first expert] concluded that the disease “vegetative polyneuropathy of the hands” features on the table of occupational diseases. This fact is not at issue, but the [employer's] liability under Article 200 of the Labour Code presupposes not only the existence of the respective disease, but also the establishment of a causal link between the disease and the conditions of work. This causal link has not been established by the [second] expert either. In her report she found that activities related to type-writing are a prerequisite for the development of vegetative polyneuropathy. However, the fact that type‑writing is in general a prerequisite for this disease does not prove the existence of a causal link between the [applicant's] conditions of work and [her] disease.\\n...The specialised medical bodies are the administrative organs empowered by law to ascertain the existence of an occupational disease and the causal link between the disease and the [conditions of] work. The [lower] courts correctly held that the circumstances that [these organs] are authorised to examine may be examined by the court having cognisance of the action under Article 200 of the Labour Code only in the absence of findings made by these organs. The [applicant] has not established before the specialised medical bodies the existence of a causal link between [her] disease and the conditions of work as a typist ... Therefore the conclusions of the [lower] courts that her action is unfounded are correct.”\"], 'applicants': ['I.D.'], 'defendants': ['BULGARIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['22', '23', '24', '27', '28', '29', '33', '34', '37', '46', '6']}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 14, 15], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 14, 15], 'explained_indices': [6, 2, 4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'explained_distances': [0.29047942, 0.25377935, 0.21563369, 0.21306628, 0.16211599, 0.13768625, 0.1113956, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054, 0.041156054], 'number_of_sentences': 16, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants were born in 1953 and 1986 respectively and live in Trakai.', '6.  By a decision of 12 March 1992 the Trakai City Council leased a plot of land 22 square metres in size, situated at no. 41 Karaimų Street in the town of Trakai, to Galina Bogdel, the wife of Piotras Bogdel and mother of Snežana Bogdel. The plot was situated on land which was State property. The plot was leased for a term of five years, for the construction of a kiosk (pastatas-kioskas) for selling pottery and souvenirs. The applicants stated that by February 1993 the kiosk had been built and was ready for use.', '7.  By decision no. 395v of 22 December 1993 the Trakai District Council established a territorial plan for the old town of Trakai city, on the basis of plans drawn up by experts on cultural heritage. The plans stipulated that plot no. 41 in Karaimų Street, situated at the entrance to Trakai castle, was not to be divided and was not to be privatised (“neprivatizuojama: salos pilies prieigos; ribos lieka esamos”).', '8.  By a decision of 27 July 1994 the Trakai District Executive Council leased to Galina Bogdel, for a term of five years, a State-owned plot of land of 134 square metres, which consisted of the previous plot and enlarged it.', '9.  On 18 January 1995 the Trakai District Executive Council adopted a decision approving the sale of the said plot of 134 square metres to Galina Bogdel for 2,874 Lithuanian litas (LTL).', '10.  On 10 February 1995 a representative of the Trakai District Executive Council and Galina Bogdel signed the land purchase agreement. The land purchase agreement was registered at the Real Estate Registry and, in accordance with Lithuanian law, Galina Bogdel became the owner of the land.', '11.  Later that year Galina Bogdel died and her husband and daughter (the applicants) inherited the plot of land with the kiosk. According to the applicants, they subsequently obtained the necessary permission and transformed the kiosk into a café.', '12.  In July 1998 the applicants contacted the Trakai District Municipality to request the enlargement of the plot of land they owned to roughly twice its size by the addition of more State land. They mentioned that the building they had erected at 41 Karaimų Street was being used as premises for public catering (kaip viešojo maitinimo patalpa). As the number of tourists in Trakai was constantly growing, there was a need to expand the premises in order to meet the hygiene and sanitary needs of a public catering facility. The municipality informed them that a new territorial plan was necessary and by a decision of 28 July 1998 entrusted the coordination of the planning project to the applicants.', '13. Once preliminary plans had been published in the Trakai town newspaper in August 1999, wide repercussions in connection with the plot of land in issue arose in the local community of Trakai. In particular, on 19 August 1999 ten residents of Karaimų Street wrote to the Head of the Vilnius County Administration (hereinafter – “the HVCA”), the director of Trakai Historical National Park and the Mayor of Trakai claiming that some time ago a small building had been erected on the plot [it was not clear whether legally or illegally], and that it had now been turned into a noisy café. The residents asked the authorities not to permit any new construction on the plot, which was in a historical place – Trakai Historical National Park – and right in front of Trakai castle and other monuments of particular architectural and historical importance (prie pat pilies, krantinės ir seniausių architektūrinių paminklų).\\nFurther, in accordance with the requirements of the Law on Territorial Planning, on 7 September 1999 a public meeting (viešas svarstymas) was held in Trakai city. The meeting was attended by residents and the Trakai town authorities. It is stated in the minutes of the meeting that some residents feared the construction of a large restaurant on the plot of land in issue.', '14.  In December 1999 a private person, R.L., who lived in Trakai city, wrote to the Committee of Education, Science and Culture of the Lithuanian Seimas. He submitted that Galina Bogdel, and later her heirs (the applicants), had been attempting to illegally obtain the plot of land situated at 41 Karaimų Street in Trakai since 1992, eventually succeeding in their unlawful endeavours. R.L. argued that the plot was situated immediately in front of Trakai castle in the Trakai Historical National Park and thus could not be privatised.', '15.  By a letter of 25 January 2000 the Committee of Education, Science and Culture forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Culture and the State Audit Office (Valstybės kontrolė, hereinafter – “the SAO”), a body whose function is to supervise the lawfulness and effectiveness of management of State property, asking them to investigate the matter.', '16.  On 3 July 2000 the SAO adopted decision no. 70, finding that the decisions to lease to Galina Bogdel and subsequently to sell her the plot of land in question (paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 above) were in breach of the legislation on territorial planning, including Article 5 § 4 of the Law on the Protected Territories, the Regulations of the Trakai Historical National Park, approved by Government ruling no. 283 of 22 April 1992, and the Trakai District Council decision of 22 December 1993 (see paragraph 7 above).\\nThe auditors also established that the Trakai municipality’s decision of 28 July 1998 to put the applicants in charge of the project of enlarging their plot of land had breached the Law on the Protection of Immovable Cultural Heritage, in that it had not been agreed upon by the State Department for the Protection of Cultural Heritage.', '17.  The SAO invited the HVCA to take appropriate measures in respect of the plot at 41 Karaimų Street “which had been sold to Galina Bogdel in breach of the applicable laws”. The SAO was to be informed of the HVCA’s decision within two months.\\nThe SAO observed that the Trakai municipality officials responsible for the decisions to sell the plot to Galina Bogdel no longer worked in the relevant section. It nevertheless urged the Trakai District Mayor to respect the law when executing territorial planning.', '18.  In the meantime another investigation was ongoing. On 3 November another auditing body, this time that of the Trakai District Municipality itself, found that Galina Bogdel had obtained her ownership of the plot of land in question in breach of the laws on the protection of cultural heritage and the relevant territorial planning decisions.', '19.  On 24 January 2001 the Trakai District Council annulled the decision of 28 July 1998. The applicants challenged that decision in court.', '20.  On 18 April 2001 the HVCA asked the court to annul the decisions of 27 July 1994 and 18 January 1995 permitting Galina Bogdel to lease the plot of land and selling it to her respectively.\\nOn 21 February the HVCA asked the court to annul the sale agreement of 10 February 1995.', '21.  Both cases were joined. The applicants then asked the court to dismiss the HVCA’s action, arguing that it was time-barred.', '22.  By a decision of 11 July 2005 the Trakai District Court dismissed the applicants’ action and granted all the HVCA’s claims. It found that the time-limit for initiating court proceedings had not been missed by the HVCA. The three-year statutory time-limit had to be calculated from the date the HVCA had learned of or should have learned of the breach of the State’s rights. That date was 3 July 2000, the date when the SAO had concluded that the land had been purchased in breach of the legislation on the protection of cultural heritage, protected territories and territorial planning. The court also noted that in 1995 the land had been sold to Galina Bogdel by a Trakai municipality official. However, in the same year the Lithuanian legislation had been amended and different administrative units – counties (in the present case, the County of Vilnius) – had been granted competence to deal with questions relating to the management of State land. Even so, after assuming competence over the administration of State land, the HVCA had had no legal obligation to initiate checks to verify whether contracts concluded by the municipalities in the past had been concluded lawfully.', '23.  On the merits of the case the Trakai District Court found that when concluding the agreements leasing the State-owned plot of land to Galina Bogdel and, subsequently, selling that plot to her, the officials of the Trakai District Municipality had breached the applicable laws and local regulations. Consequently, the court declared those agreements null and void. The court ordered restitution and returned the 134 square meters plot of land to the HVCA. No money was returned to the applicants.', '24.  The court also annulled the agreement of 27 July 1998 by which the Trakai District Municipality had entrusted the applicants with coordinating the preparation of the local plan.', '25.  The applicants appealed, arguing that more than six years had elapsed between the date the land had been bought and the date when the HVCA had initiated court proceedings for annulment. The applicants also submitted that the purpose of statutory limitation was to guarantee legal certainty. The stability of civil legal relations would be breached if a person could not reasonably expect the status quo to be maintained after the expiry of the limitation period. They also challenged the unilateral restitution. Lastly, the applicants argued that the lower court had erred in interpreting and applying the territorial planning legislation.', '26.  By a ruling of 8 November 2005 the Vilnius Regional Court upheld the reasoning of the Trakai District Court. However, it ordered double restitution. The applicants were to be refunded LTL 2,874 – the sum which Galina Bogdel had paid for the plot of land.', '27.  The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. They argued that the lower courts had erred in interpreting the legal norms on the calculation of the limitation period, and the starting date of that term in particular. They did not argue that the courts had acted in a discriminatory fashion when interpreting the public authorities’ civil action, compared with civil actions between private parties. They also submitted that the annulment of the land purchase agreement had breached their right of property, without in any way complaining that the sum they had received in restitution had been too little.', '28. On 10 May 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. It observed that at the time when the lease and sale contracts were concluded in 1994-1995, the 1964 Civil Code (Articles 84 and 86) had provided for a three-year statutory time-limit for initiating court proceedings. It had been established in the case that the HVCA had learned of the breaches of the law by those transactions on 3 July 2000, from the report by the SAO. Accordingly, when lodging its claim for the annulment of the land lease decision and the decision to sell the plot of land to Galina Bogdel, the HVCA had not missed the three-year statutory deadline. In the view of the Supreme Court, it would have been unreasonable to calculate the term of statutory limitation from 10 February 1995, the date when the land was sold to Galina Bogdel, because when the counties had been created [in 1995] the administration of each county had not been entrusted with the task of reviewing all the administrative decisions and contracts which the municipalities falling under its competence had adopted or concluded in the past.', '29.  As to the applicants’ argument that there were no legal barriers to their owning the plot of land in question, the Supreme Court noted that the Trakai Historical National Park had been created by the Supreme Soviet (Aukščiausioji Taryba, the parliament of the Republic of Lithuania at that time) on 23 April 1992, and by a Government resolution of 22 April 1992 the old town of Trakai had been recognised as an urban heritage site (urbanistinis draustinis). For that reason, on 25 May 1992 the regulations on cultural heritage established that the plot of land situated at 41 Karaimų Street was not to be privatised. Moreover, on 9 November 1993 the Law on the Protected Territories had been passed by the Seimas, providing that land in State-protected areas was not to be sold. Subsequently, by decision no. 395v of 22 December 1993, the Trakai District Council had approved a territorial plan for Trakai old town which specified that the plot of land in question was not to be privatised.', '30.  On the basis of the above, the Supreme Court held that the lower courts had been correct in quashing the Trakai municipal authorities’ decisions of 27 July 1994 and 18 January and 10 February 1995 leasing and selling the plot of land to Galina Bogdel. Moreover, the appellate court had been correct in applying the restitution procedure and refunding to the applicants the sum of LTL 2,874.', '31.  The Government submitted that after the final decision by the Supreme Court, the applicants’ property rights to the café built on the plot of land situated at 41 Karaimų Street had remained unchanged. Moreover, it can be seen from the documents submitted by the Government that after the Supreme Court’s decision the HVCA still granted the applicants’ request to lease the plot of land in question for a period of eighty-seven years. On 16 November 2006 two lease agreements were thus concluded – 34 square metres were leased to Snežana Bogdel, and 100 square metres were leased to Piotras Bogdel.'], 'applicants': ['BOGDEL'], 'defendants': ['LITHUANIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-1', '6'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-1': ['13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '28', '29', '42', '43', '45', '9'], '6': ['33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '50']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24], 'explained_indices': [1, 5, 0, 4, 3, 2, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 13, 14, 25, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 15, 26], 'explained_distances': [0.21412411, 0.2078161, 0.19463629, 0.18820879, 0.1658985, 0.054166526, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338, 0.022058338], 'number_of_sentences': 27, 'article_id': 11, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Kraków.', '8.  The applicant is a doctor, specialising in cardiac surgery. He is one of the few specialists in Poland qualified to perform heart transplants. At the relevant time he was the Director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital in Warsaw and an assistant professor at the Jagiellonian University Medical College in Kraków.', '9.  Following information submitted by doctors employed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital, on 12 December 2006 the Warsaw Regional Prosecution Office instituted an investigation into cases of alleged medical negligence and several counts of harassment of hospital staff by the applicant. It appears that the applicant was also suspected of receiving bribes from his patients.', '10.  On 12 February 2007 the applicant arrived at work at about 7 a.m. and started preparing for an operation which was planned for that morning.', '11.  At 7.40 a.m. a dozen masked and armed officers of the Central Anti‑corruption Bureau (CAB) stormed the Cardiac Surgery Clinic. Some of the officers burst into the applicant’s office pointing their firearms and shouting. The officers threw the applicant to the floor, pinned his head to the floor and then handcuffed his hands behind his back. They searched the applicant’s office. Subsequently, they allowed him to change his clothes and handcuffed him again, this time with his hands in front.', '12.  The applicant was taken, in handcuffs, out of his office to the hospital’s outdoor car park. There were a large number of masked and armed officers in the car park and some were in plain clothes. The applicant’s car was searched over a period of about one hour. A sniffer dog was also used. During this time the applicant stood nearby with his hands visibly handcuffed. The events were viewed by hundreds of hospital staff, patients and visitors. The applicant’s arrest was filmed continuously by one of the officers.', '13.  Subsequently the applicant was taken to his flat in Warsaw. Several dozen officers searched the flat over a period of nine hours. They seized several hundred objects, including bottles of alcohol, watches, fountain pens, cutlery, porcelain, and so on which were to be used as evidence of the applicant’s bribe-taking. The search of his flat was also filmed.', '14.  The applicant was then taken to a hospital for a medical check. At about midnight on 12 February 2007 the officers took the applicant to see Mr Mariusz Kamiński, the Head of the CAB, who shouted at him using offensive language. He said, among other things, that the applicant would not leave prison before turning seventy. The Government submitted that there was no information in the case file concerning the meeting between the Head of the CAB and the applicant.', '15.  The applicant was detained at Warsaw Police Headquarters.', '16.  According to the Government, the applicant did not appeal against his arrest (zażalenie na zatrzymanie) or object to the way in which the CAB’s officers executed the search of his flat.', '17.  On 13 February 2007 at about 3 p.m. the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor charged the applicant with twenty offences, including exposing a patient to a direct danger to his life or health (Article 160 § 1 of the Criminal Code (“CC”)), homicide of a patient (Article 148 § 1 of the CC), harassing a member of staff, forgery of medical documentation, and sixteen counts of taking bribes from patients. The prosecutor based his decision on the evidence gathered in the case, including statements of victims and secret video-recordings of some cases of receiving bribes.', '18.  According to the applicant, on 12 and 13 February 2007 he was not given any food.', '19.  On 14 February 2007 A.M., an assessor (junior judge) at the Warsaw-Mokotów District Court, remanded the applicant in custody until 11 May 2007. The order read as follows:\\n“The evidence gathered in the case, in particular witnesses’ depositions and the suspects’ statements (...), expert reports (...) and documentation from the secret files (...) points to a strong likelihood that the suspect [applicant] committed the offences with which he is charged, and that is a basic evidentiary condition for the imposition of a preventive measure pursuant to Article 249 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\nThe investigation is in its early stage and it is necessary to undertake many further investigative measures to clarify fully the circumstances under investigation. Having regard to the nature of the charges and the surrounding circumstances, there is a reasonable risk that the suspect, if left at liberty, could engage in acts aimed at obstruction of the proceedings. Many persons who must necessarily be questioned in the course of the present proceedings are hierarchically subordinate to the suspect [applicant], and that necessitates preventing the suspect [applicant] from contacting them in any manner. Moreover, as Director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic the suspect [applicant] has access to information which must be kept secure and is required by the authorities conducting the investigation to allow the circumstances which gave rise to the charges to be clarified in full.\\nFurthermore, in respect of one of the offences with which the suspect is charged [homicide] he is liable to a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment or life imprisonment, while in respect of many other offences he is liable to a maximum sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment. The real risk that a severe penalty might be imposed on him may thus induce the suspect to undertake illegal actions to obstruct the proceedings. ...”', '20.  On the same day, following the pronouncement of the Warsaw‑Mokotów District Court’s decision, the Minister of Justice ‑Prosecutor General and the Head of the CAB held a press conference concerning the applicant’s case.', '21.  The applicant appealed against the detention order. He submitted that the evidence in the case was insufficient to charge him with homicide and that the prosecution had intentionally formulated the charge with a view to compelling the court to remand him in detention. Furthermore, the applicant contested the finding that he would obstruct the proceedings. He argued that the District Court should have considered the imposition of other, more lenient, preventive measures having regard to the applicant’s unblemished reputation and in view of the Court’s case-law. In addition, he submitted that remanding him in detention could expose his patients to death by preventing them from undergoing their planned cardiac operations. Lastly, referring to the Convention, the applicant raised the issue of the status of the assessor and averred that she did not enjoy the necessary guarantees of independence from the executive.', '22.  On 15 March 2007 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the applicant was suspected of having committed a series of offences. The court noted:\\n“even leaving aside the charge of homicide, other charges (bribery) attracted a statutory maximum sentence of at least eight years’ imprisonment”.\\nThus, the applicant’s detention on remand was justified by the severity of the anticipated penalty, in view of the significant number of bribery charges.', '23.  As to the applicant’s argument that the evidence in the case had been insufficient to charge him with homicide, the Regional Court noted that that was not the only charge against the applicant. In connection with other charges (including bribery) there was enough evidence to substantiate a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences. The Regional Court further concurred with the District Court’s view that there was a risk that the applicant would attempt to influence witnesses, and that only custodial measures would ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court did not respond to the argument concerning the status of the assessor.', '24.  On 7 May 2007 the Warsaw Regional Court, on an application from the prosecution, extended the applicant’s detention until 11 August 2007 but at the same time held that he would be released if he put up bail in the amount of PLN 350,000 (approximately EUR 90,000) by 31 May 2007. It reasoned as follows:\\n“The prosecutor justifies his application for the extension of detention on remand by the severity of the likely penalty and the risk of obstruction [of the proceedings] by the suspect.\\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure requires the authorities conducting the proceedings to analyse, at every stage, whether the evidence gathered in the case sufficiently justifies the imposition of preventive measures. Thus, the court could not leave unaddressed the legal classification of the act allegedly committed by the suspect to the detriment of the victim J.G. under Article 148 § 1 of the Criminal Code, particularly as it appears from the grounds for the prosecutor’s application that the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment (even life imprisonment) for that act is one of the grounds for extending Mirosław Garlicki’s detention. In the court’s view, the prosecution’s assessment cannot be sustained in any way. It has to be noted that the [prosecutor’s] application does not contain any reasons for giving such a legal classification to the suspect’s act. It cannot be maintained that the reports presented by experts Z.R. and A.B. point to a possibility of charging Mirosław Garlicki with homicide committed with conditional intent (“zamiar ewentualny”). Moreover, the prosecutor assumes such legal classification of the charge in isolation from the established case-law (...) Taking into account, as stated above that the charge [of homicide] is groundless, it evidently could not serve as a ground to grant the [prosecutor’s] application.\\nHowever, the evidence gathered so far in the investigation, which, apart from witness statements, also includes evidence obtained by technical means as a result of covert measures (czynności operacyjne), points to a strong likelihood that the suspect committed the corruption-related offences with which he has been charged. Those offences attract a severe sentence of imprisonment, and having regard to their significant number it is likely that the suspect will be sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment. The last issue to determine is whether remand in custody is the only preventive measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.\\nIn the court’s view, contrary to the prosecutor’s position, there is no substantiated risk that the suspect would unlawfully obstruct the criminal proceedings, e.g. by inducing witnesses to give false testimonies. Such a risk is not in any way apparent from the statements or testimonies of persons indicated in the grounds for the [prosecutor’s] application. While it can be accepted that the need to remand the suspect in custody existed at the beginning of the proceedings, where there was a risk that he would influence the testimonies of his subordinates, there is clearly no such risk at the present moment. The investigation has been conducted with particular intensity and all the persons employed in the Cardiac Surgery Clinic of the hospital have already been heard and that evidence is secured. The suspect Mirosław Garlicki is also no longer the superior of those persons and it cannot be said that there is any hierarchical relationship between them. It is further difficult to assume in the circumstances of the case that the suspect will return to the post he held before. Similarly, it cannot be said that the suspect may influence the actions of the authority conducting the proceedings aimed at securing medical documentation and the preparation of a cardiac surgery expert report. Clearly, the suspect has no influence whatsoever in respect of the evidence obtained so far with the use of technical devices. (...) The suspect does not have a criminal record, and as it can be seen from the declarations produced by the defence, many public persons are willing to provide a guarantee that Mirosław Garlicki will not obstruct the pending proceedings. ...\\nIn those circumstances, in the court’s view, if bail in the amount of PLN 350,000 were paid within the fixed time-limit, that would be a sufficient preventive measure ensuring the proper conduct of the proceedings and the suspect’s appearance in response to every summons of the authorities conducting the proceedings.”', '25.  The prosecution appealed against the Regional Court’s decision. On 18 May 2007 the Warsaw Court of Appeal partly amended the impugned decision by imposing further preventive measures in the event of the applicant’s release. It ruled that guarantees given by A.W., deputy president of the Supreme Medical Chamber, and L.A., a member of the board of the Polish Transplantation Society, be produced. It also imposed a ban on the applicant’s leaving the country and ordered the seizure of his passport. For the rest, the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court’s decision.', '26.  On 18 May 2007 all the conditions specified by the Court of Appeal were met and the applicant was released.', '27.  It appears, as revealed by the Gazeta Wyborcza daily, that the investigation in the applicant’s case was code-named “Mengele” by the CAB. The Court of Appeal considered the code name to be inappropriate and informed the Prosecutor General accordingly.', '28.  On 12 May 2007 the applicant’s employment contract with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital came to an end.', '29.  On 24 September 2007 the public prosecutor additionally charged the applicant with nine counts of violation of employees’ rights, harassment of his wife, subjecting a person to sexual intercourse several times while abusing a relationship of dependence, attempt to subject a person to sexual intercourse, and several counts of bribery. In total, the applicant was charged with forty-nine counts of bribery.', '30.  On 7 May 2008 the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor discontinued the investigation against the applicant in respect of the charges of exposing a patient to a direct danger to his life or health (Article 160 § 2 of the CC), homicide of a patient (Article 148 § 1 of the CC) and forgery of medical documentation on the grounds that there was no evidence that the applicant had committed those offences. In respect of the first two offences, the prosecutor based his decision on the expert evidence, in particular the report prepared by a German cardiology expert.', '31.  The bill of indictment against the applicant was filed with the Warsaw-Mokotów District Court on an unspecified date.', '32.  It appears that the applicant’s trial is pending.', '33.  On 13 February 2007 the Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General and the Head of the CAB convened a press conference on the applicant’s case for the following day. The press conference took place on 14 February 2007 at 2 p.m. shortly after the Warsaw-Mokotów District Court had pronounced its decision ordering the applicant’s detention on remand.', '34.  During the press conference the Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General and the Head of the CAB referred to the applicant as “Doctor G.”. However, at the outset they specified that the applicant was the Director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital at Wołoska Street in Warsaw, which enabled the media to quickly establish the applicant’s identity.', '35.  According to the transcript of the press conference, the Head of the CAB stated in respect of the charges concerning bribe-taking:\\n“The information gathered and the evidence obtained mean that today we can tell you clearly: Doctor G., acting the part of a virtuoso of Polish cardiac surgery, is a ruthless and cynical bribe-taker. We have knowledge of several dozen bribes accepted by this doctor.”', '36.  The Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General, Mr Z. Ziobro, stated in respect of the charge of homicide:\\n“Life often writes the most brutal scenarios. The facts which the service headed by Minister Kamiński [the CAB] succeeded in unveiling are truly shocking. What we are seeing here was not limited to cynical abuse of human feelings, emotions and the affection of close relatives for their loved ones who were ill, and the exploitation of those feelings. Extorting money, robbing people not only of money but also of hope‑often, even when the hope was not really there, the money was still extorted. And not only that, the evidence shows that what could happen here is more than just massive corruption and gross negligence and medical malpractice. One of the charges made by the prosecution is that of homicide in one of the cases which the Minister Kamiński referred to me. ...\\nInitially (...) I did not believe it. I could not get it into my mind that in the health service, in a very well known clinic, a very well known and, at least until recently, universally respected cardiac surgeon and professor could perpetrate shameful acts of this sort. But when I began to find out what evidence had been gathered by the CAB, and later also by the prosecutors, I changed my mind. I have changed my mind and, unfortunately, I am more and more overcome with sadness, but we can see this unfortunately sad discovery of the truth as an important event in the true sense of that expression, in that no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man (już nikt nigdy przez tego pana życia pozbawiony nie będzie). Ladies and Gentlemen, at the present moment I have one substantiated case indicating with high probability a possible homicide, and in this connection a charge based on Article 148 [intentional homicide] of the Criminal Code was made. Other cases where the circumstances of patients’ deaths are unclear are obviously also being examined. We don’t prejudge the character of those events. Ultimately, the court will decide the case; nonetheless, what we have already established and gathered as evidence at the present moment is truly shocking ...\\nI would like to emphasise once again, that as the Prosecutor General, the person who directly supervised this case from a certain moment, I regard very highly the professionalism of the CAB’s officers, the professionalism of the prosecutors, thanks to which we succeeded in gathering strong evidence, which is rare and which definitely shows that we were dealing with a long-lasting criminal activity. ...\\nIf you will permit me, in respect of the charge of homicide, the [applicant’s] cynicism is demonstrated by the fact that where we can see from the evidence in our possession that a man [patient] was de facto sentenced to death, that did not prevent this gentleman [the applicant] from demanding a bribe from his close family, and as the family were poor, they had no possessions, they were farmers, he suggested that they sell their cow so as to have money purportedly to save their dear father. And how he went about saving [that patient] finds its expression in Article 148 of the Criminal Code, so I think that this example very [well] illustrates the attitude, the lofty morals of this virtuoso, as some media have called him. ...\\nI wanted to stress that the Director of the Clinic [the applicant] in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital has been charged with homicide; according to the prosecutors, acting with the conditional intent (“zamiar ewentualny”) of depriving a patient of life, and anticipating and accepting the result of his death, he undertook a series of acts which, in short, led to that [death]. That is what is meant by depriving of life with conditional intent, conduct which emerges from well documented evidence, hence the charge. It is a very striking and cynical desire for profit and arrogance, incredible and striking arrogance in the conduct of the person charged with committing those offences, those crimes ....”', '37.  During the press conference the CAB’s recording of the applicant’s arrest and the search of his apartment was shown. The recording emphasised the significant number of objects and money seized from the applicant’s flat which were to be used as evidence of his corruption.', '38.  The main news programme broadcast on the public television station on 14 February 2007 at 7.30 p.m. started with a news story about the applicant which was entitled “Doctor Death”. The news reader stated that “He [the applicant] had murdered a patient because he did not get a bribe from him” and informed viewers that the applicant had committed homicide and accepted bribes. News of the applicant’s arrest and the press conference was widely reported in all the media.', '39.  The Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General’s comments about the applicant prompted strong criticism from the former Ombudsman, the National Bar Council, the Polish Helsinki Committee and others. On 23 February 2007 the President of the Constitutional Court stated that the Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General had breached the Constitution by making statements about doctor G.’s [the applicant’s] guilt and that he should be held to account before the State Tribunal (Trybunał Stanu).', '40.  In response to that suggestion the Minister stated, as reported in the Rzeczpospolita daily of 24-25 February 2007:\\n“A person who has just begun holding such office [as President of the Constitutional Court] sometimes says a few words too many. I don’t take back anything and I am ready to repeat it all. The judge [the President of the Constitutional Court] should go further and demand that I be charged before the Rwanda Crimes Tribunal [International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda].”', '41.  On 12 September 2007 the applicant brought a civil action against Mr Z. Ziobro for infringement of his personal rights under Articles 24 and 448 of the Civil Code. He sought an order requiring the defendant to personally express the following apology on the main national radio and television stations and in four major newspapers:\\n“I, Zbigniew Ziobro, apologise to Dr Mirosław Garlicki for what I said about him, namely that ‘no-one else will be deprived of life by this man’, which tarnished the good name and reputation of Dr Mirosław Garlicki. I express my regret and admit that these words were deceitful and insulting and should have never been spoken by me.”\\nThe plaintiff further sought an award of PLN 70,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and an order enjoining the defendant to refrain from making any future statements which would suggest that the applicant had committed homicide.', '42.  On 25 August 2008 the Kraków Regional Court gave judgment. It ordered the defendant to publish an apology directly after the main evening news programmes on the three national television stations (TVP, Polsat and TVN). The apology read:\\n“I, Zbigniew Ziobro apologise to Dr Mirosław Garlicki for having said about him that ‘no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man’, which tarnished the reputation of Dr Mirosław Garlicki.”\\n„(Ja Zbigniew Ziobro przepraszam Pana dr Mirosława Garlickiego za wypowiedzenie pod jego adresem słów – już nikt nigdy przez tego Pana życia pozbawiony nie będzie – które naruszyły cześć Pana dr Mirosława Garlickiego).”\\nThe court awarded the applicant compensation in the amount of PLN 7,000. It dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action.', '43.  When establishing the facts, the court based its findings on the transcript of the press conference held by the Head of the CAB and the Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General on 14 February 2007, various official and private documents, press releases and rectifications issued by the Ministry of Justice and press articles.', '44.  As regards the question whether there was an infringement of the applicant’s personal rights, the Regional Court held that the defendant had damaged the applicant’s reputation (cześć). In this respect it found, inter alia:\\n“... the statements included in the defendant’s impugned announcement, including ... just the information about the prosecution’s charges brought against the claimant (whose identification was a simple matter since his first name, the first letter of his surname, his place of employment and the function held were given), without any need to refer to more categorical terms employed by the defendant such as ‘no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man’, or describing the claimant as a ruthless and cynical bribe-taker who de facto sentenced his patient to death and so on, objectively infringed the personal rights of the claimant...”', '45.  Once it was demonstrated that there was an infringement of the applicant’s personal rights, Article 24 of the Civil Code established a presumption that such infringement was unlawful. Accordingly, the Regional Court examined next whether there had been any grounds to exclude the defendant’s liability for unlawfully damaging the applicant’s reputation. The court held that the defendant’s actions had been unlawful, having regard to the nature of the allegations made against the claimant and the limitations stemming from the principle of the presumption of innocence. In this respect, the Regional Court found inter alia:\\n“...it was or could have been within the powers of the Prosecutor General – the office held by the defendant at the material time – to inform the public about particular investigations and their progress, and also to disclose – within the boundaries set by the law – information regarding the suspect or the accused. ...\\nHowever, those persons so authorised do not enjoy ‘complete freedom of expression’ as asserted by the defendant if their actions are undertaken in the public interest. That principle, despite the defendant’s assertion to the contrary, has not been accepted in the jurisprudence of the Polish courts; in particular it is not reflected in the position set out ... in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 23 July 2007 (case no. II CKN 285/97). It was clearly indicated [in this judgment] that a negative assessment of a person’s behaviour expressed by a State authority (or official) is not an unlawful assessment where, although it was not sufficiently verified or justified in the specific circumstances (because, for example, of the erroneous assessment of certain facts or the lack of complete factual material), it was nonetheless made within the scope of statutory competences and within the boundaries of matter-of-fact necessity (w ramach rzeczowej potrzeby).\\nWorth noting here is the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 10 February 1995, ... which states that freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, includes the freedom to receive and impart information. Article 6 § 2 cannot therefore prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (application no. 15175/89 [Allenet de Ribemont v. France]; see also the judgment of the ECHR of 26 March 2002, application no. 48297/99 [Butkevičius v. Lithuania]).\\nIn the court’s assessment, the critical statement of the defendant fell short of this obligation. Indeed, the defendant did not only state the charge of having committed an offence specified in Article 148 of the Criminal Code as brought against the claimant on the basis of the prosecution’s decision and the circumstances justifying it, but in his emotional, exaggerated, unbalanced and judgmental statement emphasised this charge in a manner which excluded any doubts as to its correctness (lecz swoją emocjonalną, egzaltowaną, niewyważoną i ocenną wypowiedzią wyeksponował ów zarzut w sposób wykluczający jakiekolwiek wątpliwości co do jego słuszności). This effect was exacerbated by the statement that ‘no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man’ ... For in situations where there is unintentional deprivation of life it is rather accepted to use such terms as an accident, error, coincidence, misfortune or incident. ...\\nIt should be stated once more that at the press conference no accurate information was given about the results of the investigation, [and] almost no concrete information about the investigation at all.\\nIt should be underlined that the defendant undoubtedly had the right to disclose information related to the charge brought against the claimant; however due to the risk of misinterpretation of this information by the recipients he should have refrained from statements giving rise to belief in the claimant’s guilt. The more so since as the Prosecutor General, responsible for safeguarding the rule of law (section 2 of the Prosecution Authorities Act of 20 June 1985), [he] had the duty to comply with the important principle of the legal order imposing respect for the defendant’s presumption of innocence as a legally protected interest. In this connection, the defendant should have presented the information concerning the investigation, in particular in respect of the charge of homicide, in a moderate form, without passing his own judgment, which would go significantly beyond reporting on the proceedings. It should thus be considered that the behaviour of the defendant was not factual and cautious, [and] that the opinions expressed exceeded what was strictly necessary, and the terms employed were exaggerated in form and content.”', '46.  With regard to the redress for the damage to the applicant’s reputation, the Regional Court partly modified the text of the apology by having its second sentence deleted. In so doing it took into account the type of right infringed and the scope of the infringement. Concerning the enforcement of its judgment, it obliged the defendant to publish the apology at his expense rather than requiring him to express it personally. The court further considered that it would be appropriate to limit the number of places where the apology should be published to three major television stations (one public and two private). This decision was motivated by the need to achieve the compensatory and preventive rather than the repressive goal of the publication of an apology.', '47.  As regards compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered on account of the infringement, the Regional Court held that the defendant’s fault, at least in the form of negligence, had been established. The use of words which clearly suggested that the claimant had undoubtedly committed homicide had breached the principle of the presumption of innocence, thereby infringing the claimant’s personal rights. At the relevant time the defendant had held the office of Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General, so he had been under a particular duty to formulate his statements carefully. The Regional Court awarded the applicant PLN 7,000 which it considered adequate in the circumstances, having regard to a number of relevant factors, including the gravity of the infringement and the extent of the damage suffered. It took into account that the applicant had failed to demonstrate what precise impact the impugned statement had had on his private life and that, in respect of his professional life, the applicant had been employed in a private hospital since the summer of 2008.', '48.  Both parties appealed. The applicant contested, inter alia, the manner of publication of the apology and the modification of its text. He took issue with the deletion of the second sentence from the apology, which he considered important for the restoration of his reputation. He further objected to the low amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage.', '49.  The defendant challenged the Regional Court’s judgment in its entirety. He argued that he had not infringed the applicant’s personal rights and, alternatively, that any such infringement had been in accordance with the law. The defendant alleged that the court had erroneously applied substantive and procedural law. He also submitted that the order to publish the apology had taken the appearance of a financial sanction.', '50.   On 9 December 2008 the Cracow Court of Appeal held a hearing and gave judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment only in respect of the compensation awarded to the applicant which it increased to PLN 30,000. The Court of Appeal dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s appeal and dismissed the defendant’s appeal in its entirety.', '51.  The Court of Appeal noted that the claimant had established, in accordance with the burden of proof lying on him, that his personal right to respect for his reputation had been infringed by the defendant’s statement “no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man”. In that connection, it fully accepted the factual findings and legal assessment of the Regional Court. The infringement of the claimant’s personal right had been evident as the defendant had indicated that the charge of homicide had been made against the head of a specific department of a particular hospital. As regards the damage to the applicant’s reputation, the Court of Appeal found:\\n“... the first-instance court did not violate the provisions of substantive and procedural law referred to by the defendant in his appeal. Similarly the allegation of errors in respect of factual findings which were relevant for the determination of the issue could not stand. The facts weighing in favour of the infringement of the claimant’s personal right to respect for his reputation on account of the defendant’s impugned statement were so obvious (contra factum nullum argumentum) that no argument by the defendant can entail the intended legal consequences. It is not open to doubt that since the impugned statement was made by the Minister of Justice ‑Prosecutor General the public reaction of persons who had no professional dealings with the law in respect of the claimant ... had to be negative, i.e. they would be convinced of his guilt.”', '52.  With regard to the presumption of unlawfulness of the infringement, the Court of Appeal held that the defendant had failed to rebut the presumption. It found inter alia:\\n“The constitutional and criminal-law principle of the presumption of innocence implies that an accused person (and even more so a suspect) must be presumed innocent until his guilt is proved and confirmed by a final court decision. ...\\nThe impugned statement [of the defendant] was inadmissible at that stage of the ongoing proceedings, and in particular because of the principle of the presumption of innocence. The defendant, even though he was the Minister of Justice - Prosecutor General, was not authorised to make such a statement in respect of the claimant since at that stage [of the proceedings] no final judgment convicting him of the alleged offence had been given. He [the defendant] had the unquestionable right to inform the public about the charges brought against the claimant ... but the manner in which he did it ... was not appropriate for the office which he held ...\\nMoreover, the degree of unlawfulness of the defendant’s actions results from the fact that the prosecutor charged the claimant with homicide of a patient, and the court remanded the claimant in custody and his appeal was not allowed by the second-instance court. However, as it turned out later ... the evidence subsequently gathered in the investigation did not at all substantiate such accusations ...\\nThe defendant’s impugned statement in the light of the final result of the criminal proceedings against the applicant in respect of the offence specified in Article 148 § 1 of the CC clearly underlines the essence and the purpose of the principle of the presumption of innocence.\\nIn the circumstances of the present case the defendant cannot exactly claim that he acted in accordance with the law or in defence of a justifiable public interest. It cannot be accepted either that the impugned statement was made on the basis of information which was collected with due diligence. The principle of the presumption of innocence required that the defendant display exceptional care and diligence in formulating publicly any statements to the effect that the claimant, as a doctor, committed homicide on a patient, irrespective of the information and opinions given by the persons he requested to be heard as witnesses in the case. The defendant, being a lawyer holding a high public office, should in particular have consulted expert opinions. ...”', '53.  The Court of Appeal concurred with the Regional Court’s judgment in respect of the text of the apology and the form in which it was to be made. With regard to compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the Court of Appeal agreed that the defendant had been at fault through negligence, but held that it had been gross negligence. It found in this respect:\\n“... the defendant is a lawyer, and at the time of the infringement of the claimant’s personal right he held the office of Minister of Justice – Prosecutor General, and as such he should have known what information from the investigation ... he could make public, as well as what he could say about a person who was charged and remanded in custody. On the other hand, as a politician he should have been aware of the media effect of such a categorical statement as ‘no-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man’ in the claimant’s case and where the defendant divulged the necessary information to enable the claimant’s identification. ... The impugned statement, having regard to the stage of the ongoing criminal proceedings against the claimant, violated the basic written rules of legal knowledge (the presumption of innocence and in dubio pro reo). Moreover, in a case where a doctor – whose mission, vocation and task is to save human life and health – was charged with homicide of a patient in connection with a surgical operation (it is difficult to imagine a more serious allegation against a doctor in relation to his profession) he should have realised that to make publicly so categorical and definite a statement was highly unprofessional and irresponsible ...”\\nThe Court of Appeal, having regard to all the factual circumstances of the case, including the significant publicity which the defendant’s statement attracted in the media and the moral suffering of the applicant, found that it would be appropriate to award PLN 30,000 for non-pecuniary damage.', '54.  Mr Z. Ziobro lodged a cassation appeal against the Court of Appeal’s judgment. On 29 October 2009 the Supreme Court refused to entertain his cassation appeal. It found that there had been no significant legal issue in the case which would justify the examination of the cassation appeal on the merits.', '55.  On an unspecified date the defendant paid the applicant the compensation awarded by the court.', '56.  On 9 January 2010 Mr Z. Ziobro’s apology was broadcast.', '57.  On 16 February 2007 the Regional Prosecutor made a seizure order in respect of the applicant’s property with a view to securing the payment of an anticipated fine in the amount of PLN 720,000 (EUR 180,000). The order extended to the applicant’s movable property, including money found in his flat, his salary and his bank accounts. The applicant was also prohibited from selling his car.', '58.  On the same day the prosecutor made a second seizure order in respect of the money found during the search of the house of the applicant’s parents. The prosecutor seized a total of approximately PLN 90,000.', '59.  The applicant appealed against the seizure orders, arguing that they were ultra vires at that stage of the investigation and clearly excessive in view of the charges against the applicant.', '60.  On 26 April 2007 the Warsaw-Mokotów District Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the seizure orders had complied with the requirements specified in Article 291 §§ 1-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely that he had been charged with offences in respect of which a fine or obligation to compensate damage might be imposed. The court noted that at this stage of the proceedings the prosecutor’s decision could not be considered arbitrary, having regard to the evidence gathered in the case. Furthermore, the measure had been intended to effectively secure the payment of a significant fine which might be imposed on the applicant.', '61.  On 11 September 2007 the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor issued a press release announcing that some of the objects found in the applicant’s flat had been returned to him as they were his personal property and were irrelevant to the ongoing proceedings.'], 'applicants': ['MIROSLAW GARLICKI'], 'defendants': ['POLAND'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['5'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['36', '90'], '6': ['135', '136', '30', '45', '52']}, 'silver_rationales': [23, 29, 38, 45], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [23, 29, 38, 45], 'explained_indices': [4, 2, 0, 3, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 30, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 42, 29, 27, 53, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 28, 16, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 17, 54, 6, 1, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.27323228, 0.1205582, 0.08197081, 0.031456918, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, 0.0037089586, -0.062384635, -0.072078556, -0.08618596], 'number_of_sentences': 55, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The case concerns the killing on 19 July 1996 of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov by a member of the military police who was attempting to arrest them.', '11.  All the applicants are Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin.', \"12.  Ms Anelia Kunchova Nachova, who was born in 1995, is Mr Angelov's daughter. Ms Aksiniya Hristova, who was born in 1978, is Ms Nachova's mother. Both live in Dobrolevo, Bulgaria. Ms Todorka Petrova Rangelova and Mr Rangel Petkov Rangelov, who were born in 1955 and 1954 respectively and live in Lom, Bulgaria, are Mr Petkov's parents.\", '13.  In 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov, who were both 21 years old, were conscripts in the Construction Force (Строителни войски), a division of the army dealing with the construction of apartment blocks and other civilian projects.', \"14.  Early in 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were arrested for being repeatedly absent without leave. On 22 May 1996 Mr Angelov was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and Mr Petkov to five months' imprisonment. Both had previous convictions for theft.\", \"15.  On 15 July 1996 they fled from a construction site outside the prison where they had been brought to work and travelled to the home of Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, in the village of Lesura. Neither man was armed.\", \"16.  Their absence was reported the following day and their names put on the military police's wanted list. A warrant for their arrest was received on 16 July 1996 by the Vratsa Military Police Unit.\", '17.  At around twelve noon on 19 July 1996, the officer on duty in the Vratsa Military Police Unit received an anonymous telephone message that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were hiding in the village of Lesura. On at least one of the previous occasions when he had been absent without leave, it was there that Mr Angelov had been found and arrested.', '18.  The commanding officer, Colonel D., decided to dispatch four military police officers, under the command of Major G., to locate and arrest the two men. At least two of the officers knew one or both of them. Major G. apparently knew Lesura because, according to a secretary who worked at the town hall and was heard later as a witness, his mother was from the village.', '19.  Colonel D. told the officers that “in accordance with the rules” they should carry their handguns and automatic rifles and wear bullet-proof vests. He informed them that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were “criminally active” (криминално проявени) – an expression used to denote persons with previous convictions or persons suspected of an offence – and that they had escaped from detention. The officers were instructed to use whatever means were dictated by the circumstances to arrest them.', '20.  The officers immediately left for Lesura in a jeep. Two officers wore uniforms while the others were in civilian clothes. Only Major G. wore a bullet-proof vest. He was armed with a personal handgun and a 7.62 mm calibre Kalashnikov automatic rifle. The other men carried handguns. Three Kalashnikov automatic rifles remained in the boot of the vehicle throughout the operation.', '21.  The officers were briefed orally by Major G. on their way to Lesura. Sergeant N. was to cover the east side of the house, Major G. the west side and Sergeant K. was to go into the house. Sergeant S., the driver, was to remain with the vehicle and keep watch over the north side.', \"22.  At around 1 p.m. the officers arrived in Lesura. They asked a secretary at the town hall and one of the villagers, Mr T.M., to join them and show them Mr Angelov's grandmother's house. The vehicle drove into Lesura's Roma district.\", '23.  Sergeant N. recognised the house since he had previously arrested Mr Angelov there for being absent without leave.', '24.  As soon as the jeep drew up in front of the house, between 1 and 1.30 p.m., Sergeant K. recognised Mr Angelov, who was inside, behind the window. Having noticed the vehicle, the fugitives tried to escape. The officers heard the sound of a window pane being broken. Major G. and Sergeants K. and N. jumped out of the vehicle while it was still moving. Major G. and Sergeant K. went through the garden gate, the former going to the west side of the house, and the latter entering the house. Sergeant N. headed towards the east side of the house. Sergeant S. remained with the car, together with the secretary who worked at the town hall and Mr T.M.', \"25.  Sergeant N. later testified that, having noticed Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov escaping through the window and running towards a neighbour's yard, he had shouted: “Stop, military police!” He had pulled out his gun, but had not fired any shots. The two men had carried on running. Sergeant N. had run out on to the street in an effort to intercept them by cutting past several houses. While running, he had heard Major G. shout: “Freeze, military police, freeze [or] I'll shoot!” It was then that the shooting had started.\", \"26.  Major G. stated in his testimony:\\n“... I heard Sergeant N. shouting: 'Freeze, police' ... I saw the conscripts; they were running and then stopped in front of the fence between Ms Tonkova's and the neighbour's yards ... I saw that they were trying to jump over the [chain-link] fence, so I shouted: 'Freeze, or I'll shoot!' I released the safety catch and loaded the automatic gun. Then I fired a shot in the air, holding the automatic rifle upwards with my right hand, almost perpendicular to the ground ... The conscripts climbed over the [chain-link] fence and continued to run, I followed them, then I fired one, two or three more times in the air and shouted: 'Freeze!', but they continued running. I again fired shots in the air with the automatic and shouted: 'Freeze, or I will shoot with live cartridges.' I warned them again, but they continued running without turning back. I fired to the right [of the two men] with the automatic after the warning, aiming at the ground, hoping that this would make them stop running. I again shouted 'Freeze!' when they were at the corner of the other house and then I aimed and fired at them as they were scaling the fence. I aimed at their feet. The ground where I stood was at a lower level ... [B]y jumping over the second fence they would have escaped and I did not have any other means of stopping them. The gradient there was a bit steep, [I] was standing on lower ground ... the second fence was on the highest ground, that is why when I fired the first time I aimed to the side [of the two men], as I considered that nobody from the neighbouring houses would be hurt, and the second time I aimed at the conscripts, but fired at their feet. Under Regulation 45 we can use firearms to arrest members of the military forces who have committed a publicly prosecutable offence and do not surrender after a warning, but in accordance with paragraph 3 of [that regulation] we have to protect the lives of the persons against whom [we use firearms] – for that reason I fired at [the victims'] feet – with the intention of avoiding fatal injury. The last time that I shot at the conscripts' feet, I was twenty metres away from them and they were exactly at the south-east corner of the neighbouring yard. After the shooting they both fell down ...They were both lying on their stomachs, and both gave signs of life, ... moaning ... then Sergeant S. appeared, I called him ... and handed him my automatic rifle ...”\", '27.  According to the statements of the three subordinate officers, Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were lying on the ground in front of the fence, with their legs pointing in the direction of the house from which they had come. One of them was lying on his back and the other on his stomach.', \"28.  A neighbour, Mr Z., who lived opposite Mr Angelov's grandmother, also gave evidence. At about 1 or 1.30 p.m. he had seen a military jeep pull up in front of Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had heard somebody shout: “Don't run, I am using live cartridges.” He had then heard shots. He had looked into the next yard and seen Mr Angelov, whom he knew, and another man leap over the chain-link fence between Ms Tonkova's and another neighbour's yards. He had not seen the man who had shouted as he was hidden from view behind Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov fall to the ground and the man who had shot them emerge, holding an automatic rifle. Mr Z. further stated:\\n“The other men in uniform then started remonstrating with [the man who had shot Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov] telling him that he should not have fired, that he should not have come with them. Of those who came in the jeep, only the senior officer fired ... I know him by sight, he has relatives in Lesura.”\", '29.  Sergeant S. stated that on arriving at the house he had remained with the vehicle and had heard Sergeant N. shouting from the east side of the house: “Freeze, police!” He had also heard Major G. shout “Freeze, police!” several times from the west side of the house. Then Major G. had started shooting with his automatic weapon, while continuing to shout. Sergeant S. had then entered the yard. He had seen Major G. leap over the chain-link fence and heard him shouting. He had gone up to him, had taken his automatic rifle and seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov lying on the ground next to the fence. They were still alive. At that moment Sergeant K. had come out of the house. Major G. had gone to get the jeep and had reported the incident over the vehicle radio. When they returned, Sergeant N. had appeared from the neighbouring street and helped them put the wounded men in the vehicle.', '30.  The head of the Vratsa Military Police Unit and other officers were informed of the incident at around 1.30 p.m.', \"31.  Sergeant K. testified that he had entered the house and had been speaking to Mr Angelov's grandmother and another woman when he heard Major G. shouting at Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov to stop. In the house, he had noticed that a window pane in the room overlooking the yard had been broken. He had been on the verge of leaving the house when he heard shooting coming from behind the house. On his way to the yard he had met Major G., who had told him that the fugitives had been wounded. Sergeant K. had then climbed over the chain-link fence and approached the wounded men, who were still alive and moaning. He had found himself holding the automatic rifle, but could not remember how it had come into his possession. He had opened the magazine and seen no cartridges in it. There was only one cartridge left in the barrel.\", '32.  Immediately after the shooting, a number of people from the vicinity gathered. Sergeant K. and Sergeant S. took the wounded men to Vratsa Hospital, while Major G. and Sergeant N. remained at the scene.', '33.  Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov died on the way to Vratsa. They were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.', \"34.  Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, gave the following account of the events. Her grandson and Mr Petkov had been in her house when they had noticed a jeep approaching. She had gone outside and seen four men in uniform. They had all entered the yard. One of them had gone round the house and started shooting with an automatic rifle for a very long time. The other three men were also armed but had not fired any shots. She had been in the yard, pleading with the man who had been shooting to stop. However, he had walked towards the back of the house. Then she had heard shooting in the backyard. She had followed and then seen her grandson and Mr Petkov lying in the neighbours' yard with bullet wounds.\", '35.  According to another neighbour, Mr M.M., all three policemen were shooting. Two of them had fired shots in the air and the third officer – who had been on the west side of the house (Major G.) – had been aiming at someone. Mr M.M. had heard some fifteen to twenty shots, perhaps more. Then he had seen the military policemen go to the neighbouring yard, where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. That yard belonged to Mr M.M. and his daughter. On seeing his grandson – a young boy – standing there, Mr M.M. had asked Major G. for permission to approach and to take him away. Major G. had pointed his gun at him in a brutal manner and had insulted him, saying: “You damn Gypsies!” (“мамка ви циганска”).', '36.  On 19 July 1996 all the officers involved made separate reports on the incident to the Vratsa Military Police Unit. None of them was tested for alcohol.', \"37.  A criminal investigation into the deaths was opened the same day, and between 4 and 4.30 p.m. a military investigator inspected the scene. In his report he described the scene, including the respective positions of Ms Tonkova's house, the first chain-link fence, and the spent cartridges and bloodstains found there. He indicated that the structure of the first chain-link fence was damaged and the fence had been torn down in one place.\", \"38.  A sketch map was appended to the report. It showed the yard of Ms Tonkova's house and the neighbouring yard where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. The places where spent cartridges had been found were indicated. The sketch map and the report gave only some of the measurements of the yards. The gradient and other characteristics of the terrain and the surrounding area were not described.\", \"39.  Nine spent cartridges were retrieved. One cartridge was found in the street, in front of Ms Tonkova's house (apparently not far from where the jeep had stopped). Four cartridges were discovered in Ms Tonkova's yard, behind the house, close to the first chain-link fence separating her yard from the neighbour's yard. Three cartridges were found in the yard of the neighbour (Mr M.M), close to the place where the bloodstains were found. The exact distance between those cartridges and the bloodstains was not given. A ninth cartridge was found subsequently and handed in to the military police by Mr Angelov's uncle. There is no record of where it was found.\", '40.  The bloodstains were a metre apart. They were marked on the sketch map as being slightly more than nine metres from the first chain-link fence. The distance between the bloodstains and the second fence that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had apparently been trying to scale when they were shot was not indicated. Samples of the bloodstains were taken by the investigator.', \"41.  On 21 July 1996, a pathologist carried out an autopsy.\\nAccording to autopsy report no. 139/96, the cause of Mr Petkov's death was “a wound to the chest”, the direction of the shot having been “from front to back”. The wound was described as follows:\\n“There is an oval-shaped wound of 2.5 cm by 1 cm in the chest, at a distance of 144 cm from the feet, with missing tissues, and jagged and compressed edges in the area of the left shoulder. There is an oval-shaped wound of 3 cm in the back, to the left of the infrascapular line at a distance of 123 cm from the feet with missing tissues, jagged and torn edges turned outwards.”\", '42.  As regards Mr Angelov, the report found that the cause of death had been “a gunshot wound, which [had] damaged a major blood vessel” and that the direction of the shot had been “from back to front”. It was further stated:\\n“There is a round wound on the left of the buttocks at a distance of 90 cm from the feet ... with missing tissue, jagged walls and edges, and a diameter of about 0.8 cm ... There is an oval wound of 2.1 cm with jagged torn edges and walls turned outwards and missing tissues on the border between the lower and middle third [of the abdomen], at a distance of 95 cm from the feet, slightly to the left of the navel.”', '43.  The report concluded that the injuries had been caused by an automatic rifle fired from a distance.', \"44.  On 22, 23 and 24 July 1996 the four military police officers, two neighbours (M.M. and K.), the secretary who worked at the town hall, and Mr Angelov's uncle were questioned by the investigator. Mr Petkov's mother was also questioned subsequently.\", \"45.  On 1 August 1996 Major G.'s automatic rifle, a cartridge that had been found in it and the nine spent cartridges found at the scene were examined by a ballistics expert from the Vratsa Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs. According to his report, the automatic rifle was serviceable, all nine retrieved cartridges had been fired from it and the last cartridge which had not been fired was also serviceable.\", \"46.  A report by a forensic expert dated 29 August 1996 found an alcohol content of 0.55 g/l in Mr Petkov's blood and 0.75 g/l in Mr Angelov's blood (under Bulgarian law it is an administrative offence to drive with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.5 g/l).\", \"47.  On 20 September 1996 a forensic examination of the bloodstains found at the scene was carried out by an expert from the Vratsa Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs and they were found to match the victims' blood groups.\", \"48.  On 20 January and on 13 February 1997 another neighbour (Mr T.M.) and Ms Hristova (one of the applicants) were questioned. On 26 March 1997 Mr Angelov's grandmother and a neighbour, Z., were questioned.\", '49.  On 7 January 1997 the families of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were given access to the investigation file. They requested that three more witnesses, T.M., Ms Tonkova and Z.H. be heard. Their request was granted. The witnesses were heard by the investigator on 20 January and 26 March 1997. The applicants did not ask for any other evidence to be obtained.', \"50.  On 31 March 1997 the investigator completed the preliminary investigation and drew up a final report. He noted that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had escaped from detention while serving a prison sentence, and had thus committed an offence. Major G. had done everything within his power to save their lives: he had instructed them to stop and surrender and had fired warning shots. He had aimed at them only after seeing that they were continuing to run away and might escape. He had not sought to injure any vital organs. The investigator therefore concluded that Major G. had acted in accordance with Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations and made a recommendation to the Pleven regional prosecutor's office that the investigation should be closed as Major G. had not committed an offence.\", \"51.  On 8 April 1997 the Pleven military prosecutor accepted the investigator's recommendation and closed the preliminary investigation into the deaths. He concluded that Major G. had proceeded in accordance with Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations. He had warned the two men several times and fired shots in the air. He had shot them only because they had not surrendered, as there had been a danger that they might escape. He had sought to avoid inflicting fatal injuries. No one else had been hurt.\", \"52.  When describing the victims' personal circumstances, including details of their family, education and previous convictions, the prosecutor stated in the order that both men originated from “minority families”, an expression mainly used to designate people from the Roma minority.\", \"53.  By an order of 11 June 1997, the prosecutor of the armed forces prosecutor's office dismissed the applicants' subsequent appeal on the grounds that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had provoked the shooting by trying to escape and that Major G. had taken the steps required by law in such situations. Therefore, the use of arms had been lawful under Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations.\", \"54.  On 19 November 1997 the prosecutor from the investigation review department of the armed forces prosecutor's office dismissed a further appeal on grounds similar to those that had been relied on by the other public prosecutors.\", \"55.  In its country reports of the last few years, the Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has expressed concern regarding racially motivated police violence, particularly against Roma, in a number of European countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\", '56.  The report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its member States in 2002, prepared by the European Union network of independent experts in fundamental rights at the request of the European Commission, stated, inter alia, that police abuse against Roma and similar groups, including physical abuse and excessive use of force, had been reported in a number of European Union member States, such as Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.', '57.  In its second report on Bulgaria, published in March 2000, ECRI stated, inter alia:\\n“Of particular concern is the incidence of police discrimination and mistreatment of members of the Roma/Gypsy community. ... [T]he Human Rights Project documents in its Annual Report for 1998 numerous ... cases of police misconduct towards ... Roma ... It cites as the most common violations: use of excessive physical force during detention for the purposes of extorting evidence; unjustified use of firearms ... and threats to the personal security of individuals who had complained against the police to the competent authorities. ... The Human Rights Project notes ... that the majority of complaints filed by this non-governmental organisation on behalf of Roma victims of police violence have not been followed up by the authorities. ... [V]ictims seem unwilling to come forward with complaints, particularly when they are awaiting court sentences ... [There is apparently also] some unwillingness on the part of the authorities to admit that problems of police misconduct do exist. ...\\nECRI [reiterates its recommendation] that an independent body be set up – acting at central and local level – to investigate police, investigative and penitentiary practices for overt and covert racial discrimination and to ensure that any discrimination perpetrated be severely punished. ...\\nECRI is concerned at the persistence of widespread discrimination against members of the Roma/Gypsy community in Bulgaria. ... It is reported that local authorities are sometimes involved in the illegal administration of justice as regards Roma/Gypsy communities, often with the silent collusion of local police.”', \"58.  In its third report on Bulgaria, published in January 2004, ECRI stated, inter alia:\\n“[Since ECRI's second report,] there have been no changes in the Criminal Code [to ensure that criminal law provisions fully allow any racist motivation to be taken into account]. ... ECRI recommends that the Bulgarian authorities insert a provision in the Criminal Code expressly stating that racist motivation for any ordinary offence constitute[s] an aggravating circumstance. ...\\nECRI is concerned about allegations of instances of excessive use of firearms by the police, which have sometimes led to the death of Roma. ... ECRI strongly recommends that the Bulgarian authorities take steps to restrict the use of firearms by the law enforcement agencies to cases where their use is really necessary. In particular, it urges the Bulgarian authorities to amend the law to this end and ensure that international standards are conformed to in practice in this field.\\nECRI is particularly concerned about the findings ... that the proportion of people of Roma origin who state that they have been subjected to physical violence in police stations is three times higher than the proportion of people of Bulgarian origin. ... So far, the Bulgarian authorities have not set up an independent body to investigate ill‑treatment or acts of discrimination committed by members of the police force. ...\\nECRI is pleased to learn that a specialised human rights committee was set up in the National Police Department in August 2000 ... Numerous schemes have been launched to provide human rights training for police officers ...\\n...\\nThe Framework Programme for Equal Integration of Roma in Bulgarian Society is unanimously considered, including by Roma representatives, to be well structured and fairly comprehensive ... There is, however, a unanimous feeling within the Roma community and among non-governmental organisations, that, apart from the few initiatives mentioned in this report, the programme has remained a dead letter ... The view in certain quarters is that the government lacks the political resolve to carry through such a programme ... ECRI is very concerned to learn that, four years after the adoption of the Framework Programme, its implementation is still in its early stages. ...”\", '59.

The applicant leased premises in a house owned by Kovospracujúci podnik, a State owned company with registered office in Prešov. He ran his business there. In April and May 1991 the applicant claimed that the relevant provisions of the State Property Transfer Act of 1990 (Act No. 427/1990) entitled him to purchase the part of the house which he leased.', '10.  On 12 June 1991 the Prešov District Commission for Denationalisation of State-Owned Property decided that the applicant was not entitled, under the State Property Transfer Act of 1990, to be given priority in purchasing the premises leased by him.', '11.  On 6 June 1991 the applicant filed an arbitration request claiming tht Kovospracujúci podnik should be ordered to conclude a purchase contract with him under Act No. 427/1990 in respect of the two premises leased by him and having the surface of 47.7 and 34.9 square metres respectively. The applicant further claimed that the purchase contract was to be determined pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 427/1990.', '12.  On 16 July 1991 the Regional Arbitration Court (Krajská štátna arbitráž) in Košice delivered a decision the operative part of which reads:\\n“The defendant – Kovospracujúci podnik, a State owned enterprise in Prešov is obliged to conclude a purchase contract with [the applicant] who has leased two premises situated ... in the building located in Prešov, Hlavná ulica 79 and having a surface area of 47.7 and 34.9 square metres respectively. The purchase contract shall concern the above premises and is to be concluded under Section 16(2) of Act No. 427/1990 within ten days from the final effect of this decision, it being understood that the purchase price will be determined pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 427/1990.”\\nThe decision acquired final binding effect on 8 August 1991.', '13.  On 9 October 1991 the applicant concluded a purchase contract with Kovospracujúci podnik and paid the purchase price. The contract comprised several premises the total surface area of which was 145 square metres and also real estate with a surface area of 883 square metres. Subsequently Kovospracujúci podnik was placed in liquidation.', '14.  On 23 July 1992 the liquidator claimed that the proceedings leading to the decision of the Regional Arbitration Court of 16 July 1991 be re-opened. The liquidator argued that the requirements of the State Property Transfer Act of 1990 had not been met. On 25 February 1994 the Košice Regional Court dismissed the request. The decision stated that the liquidator had submitted no new relevant facts which could not have been invoked in the original proceedings and that, accordingly, the statutory requirements for re-opening the proceedings had not been met.', '15.  On 31 January 1995 the Prešov District Court declared the purchase contract of 9 October 1991 void ex tunc at the initiative of the Prešov District Prosecutor. The District Court found that in the contract the parties had not explicitly agreed on the date of transfer of the ownership as required by the relevant law and that the lawyer of Kovospracujúci podnik had exceeded his power in that he had also included in the contract premises which had not been leased by the applicant.', '16.  On 20 December 1995 the Košice Regional Court upheld the District Court’s judgment. The Regional Court found that the contract did not specify the property in question with sufficient certainty and that this resulted in conflicts between the applicant and another person who had purchased the remaining part of the house from Kovospracujúci podnik. With the consent of the parties the Košice Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claim that Kovospracujúci podnik and the applicant should restore to each other everything which had been the subject of the contract of 9 October 1991.', '17.  On 19 December 1995 the applicant requested the Prešov District Court to enforce the decision delivered by the Regional Arbitration Court in Košice on 16 July 1991. He relied on Article III (7)(a) of Act No. 519/1991, Section 763(1) of the Business Code and Section 42a(6) of the Arbitration Act.', '18.  In December 1995 and in March 1996 the applicant submitted a new draft purchase contract for signature to the liquidator of Kovospracujúci podnik with reference to the arbitration court’s decision of 1991. On 22 April 1996 the liquidator asked the applicant in writing to submit a supplement to the draft contract as well as an expert opinion.', '19.  On 9 April 1996 the person who had purchased the other part of the house claimed that the co-ownership of the house be dissolved and that the share owned by Kovospracujúci podnik be transferred to his ownership. On 22 April 1996 the Prešov District Court granted the claim with reference to Article 142(1) of the Civil Code and ordered the plaintiff to pay 188,496.61 Slovakian korunas (SKK) to Kovospracujúci podnik. The liquidator of the latter waived his right to appeal and the judgment became final on 2 May 1996. It was not served on the applicant as he was not a party to the proceedings.', '20.  On 17 May 1996 the applicant requested the grant of an interim measure prohibiting Kovospracujúci podnik from concluding any contracts for the transfer of the property in question. On the same day the Prešov District Court granted the request. On 7 February 1997 the Košice Regional Court reversed the first instance decision as, at the time of its delivery, Kovospracujúci podnik no longer owned the property.', '21.  On 23 May 1997 the applicant complained about a violation of his property rights to the Constitutional Court. On 1 July 1997 the latter rejected the petition for lack of jurisdiction.', '22.  On 26 May 1997 the applicant requested the Prešov District Court to consider the new owner of the house as defendant in the enforcement proceedings brought on 19 December 1995.', '23.  On 4 June 1997 the Prešov District Court, responding to the applicant’s above request of 19 December 1995, ordered the enforcement of the decision of the Regional Arbitration Court of 16 July 1991 in that it imposed a fine of SKK 5,000 on the owner of the house with reference to Article 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court expressed the view that the obligation to conclude a purchase contract had passed ex lege to the new owner of the house following the transfer of ownership to him. The proceedings were discontinued so far as they concerned Kovospracujúci podnik, as the latter no longer owned the property. The owner of the house appealed.', '24.  On 15 August 1997 the Prešov Regional Court quashed the District Court’s decision of 4 June 1997. The Regional Court did not find it established that the obligation imposed by the arbitration court in 1991 had been transferred to the new owner of the house. It therefore instructed the first instance court to ask the applicant and the liquidator of Kovospracujúci podnik whether they agreed to a change of defendant. Failing such an agreement, there could be no change of defendant.', '25.  As to the merits of the applicant’s claim for enforcement, the Regional Court’s decision stated:\\n“... it is not possible to proceed pursuant to Article 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by any other means of enforcement of a decision where the decision to be executed imposes an obligation to make a certain declaration of intent [prejav vôle] within the meaning of Article 80(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure (for example to conclude a purchase contract). In such a case Section 161(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable ... but Article 161(3) is to be applied, according to which final judgments imposing the declaration of intent replace such a declaration of intent. Accordingly, on the basis of such a judgment it is not possible to claim its judicial enforcement where the person concerned fails to comply with the obligation imposed, and it is not possible to have recourse to Article 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure...”', '26.  On 6 November 1997 the Prešov District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for change of defendant as the liquidator of Kovospracujúci podnik disagreed with the proposal. The statutory requirements for granting the applicant’s request had thus not been met.', '27.  In a separate decision delivered on 6 November 1997 the Prešov District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for enforcement of the Košice Regional Arbitration Court’s decision of 16 July 1991. In particular, the District Court’s decision stated:\\n“...a decision relating to a declaration of intent may be relied on by the person at whose request it is made and is given effect to as a document reflecting a legal act, in accordance with the legal rules in force. The decision is submitted to the competent legal authority, where necessary, with a view to registering or making public the intent of the person against whom the proceedings have been brought. Such a decision may not be the subject either of judicial enforcement or of execution by an execution officer.\\nThe Košice Arbitration Court’s decision of 16 July 1991 ... cannot be enforced as it lacks a material element of enforceability. Where proceedings concern a declaration of intent in respect of a contract, the operative part of the decision on the merits of the case must contain all essential elements of such a contract ... Where one of such elements is omitted, the decision on the merits cannot be enforced pursuant to Article 161(3) and such a shortcoming cannot be remedied by any other means of enforcement.\\nIn the present case [the dispute concerns] a purchase contract. The definition of the purchase price is, along with its object, one of the essential elements of such a contract. Reference [in the Arbitration Court’s decision of 16 July 1991] to Section 16 of Act No. 427/1990 does not mean that the [vendor’s] declaration of intent which was to be replaced was sufficiently certain as required by Section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\nIn the case under consideration it is Article 161(3) and not Article 161(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure which is applicable... This means that on the basis of a judgment [replacing the declaration of intent of a party] ... it is not possible to claim judicial enforcement and it is not possible to proceed pursuant to Section 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure.”', '28.  The applicant appealed. He argued, inter alia, that the arbitration court’s decision of 16 July 1991 had not replaced the declaration of intent of the defendant company but had obliged its representatives to conclude a contract with the applicant.', '29.  On 18 December 1997 the Prešov Regional Court upheld the District Court’s decisions of 6 November 1997. The Regional Court noted that it was not possible to change defendants in the context of enforcement proceedings as a decision could be enforced only in respect of the person against whom it was delivered. The new owner of the house did not become the general successor to Kovospracujúci podnik which still existed. By purchasing the house the new owner was not, therefore, liable for the original owner’s contractual obligations.', '30.  As regards the applicant’s request for enforcement of the arbitration court’s decision of 16 July 1991, the Prešov Regional Court fully subscribed to the views expressed by the first instance court. In particular, the Regional Court’s decision stated that a decision ordering a party to conclude a purchase contract replaced the intent of the vendor to do so. In respect of such decisions, Article 161(3) was relevant, according to which, once they were of binding and final effect, such decisions replaced the intent of the party concerned. Enforcement of such decisions under Articles 161(1) and 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure was excluded.', '31.  In 1998 the applicant was ordered to move his business out of the premises in question. On 26 April 1999 the Prešov District Court ordered the applicant to pay SKK 513,187 plus default interest to the owner of the premises as compensation for their prior use.'], 'applicants': ['KACMAR'], 'defendants': ['SLOVAKIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', 'P1-1', '6'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-1': ['12', '13', '27']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 4, 18], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 4, 18], 'explained_indices': [3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 11, 21, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 12, 22], 'explained_distances': [0.27358568, 0.26627988, 0.04336506, 0.038975477, 0.014124155, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865, 0.007844865], 'number_of_sentences': 23, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 23 December 1991 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on the basis of an investigator's order of 13 December 1991, which stated that he had been charged with an offence punishable with up to twenty years' imprisonment or death, that he did not have a fixed place of abode and that his whereabouts were unknown. There was also a risk that he could endanger the lives of witnesses.\", \"27.  On 23 March 1993 the Varna Regional Court denied an application for release by the applicant, holding that detention was mandatory in the case of persons charged with an offence punishable by more than ten years' imprisonment. An exception was only possible if there was no risk, i.e., it was physically unfeasible for the applicant to abscond or reoffend, which was not the case. A further application for release made on 26 April 1993 was likewise denied by the court, which noted that it had already ruled on such an application a month earlier and there had been no change in the circumstances since then. It also stated that the applicant's arguments concerning the lack of evidence against him went to the merits of the criminal case, not to the issue whether or not he should be released.\", '28.  On 14 May 1993 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a prison term. That conviction and sentence were quashed on 10 November 1993 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).', \"29.  After 10 November 1993 the applicant remained in custody. On 21 September 1994 the Varna Regional Prosecutor's Office refused his application for release, reasoning that, in view of the applicant's threats against certain witnesses and a prosecutor, there was a risk that he could hinder the investigation by destroying evidence and suborning and intimidating witnesses.\", \"30.  On an unspecified date in the meantime the applicant made offensive remarks against a prosecutor in a complaint concerning the handling of his case. On 2 September 1994 he was convicted on account of these remarks and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. On an unspecified date he was convicted on other charges concerning events before December 1991 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In accordance with the rules on sentencing, he was ordered to serve a nine months' prison term as a result of these convictions and sentences. It appears from the documents in the case file that the applicant did so between 18 November 1994 and 18 August 1995. After that his pre‑trial detention on the murder charges continued.\", \"31.  On 14 November 1995 the Varna Regional Prosecutor's Office denied an application for release by the applicant. It reasoned that in view of the seriousness of the charges against him pre-trial detention was mandatory by virtue of Article 152 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974 (“the CCP”). It also stated that it was impossible to use the exception provided for by paragraph 2 of that Article, as its application was excluded by paragraph 3 thereof owing to the fact that there were two other sets of criminal proceedings pending against the applicant (see paragraphs 48‑51 below).\", '32.  The applicant submitted a number of other applications for release, some of which were denied by the prosecution authorities and some of which were apparently not replied to. Some of the decisions contained no reasoning, while others stated that his remand in custody was mandatory in view of the seriousness of the charges against him.', '33.  The applicant also submitted a number of applications for release to the competent court. He filed such applications on 7 June and 7 November 1997, and on 9 February, 29 April and 10 August 1998. He advanced various arguments regarding the weak case against him, the lack of a risk of fleeing and his weakening health. Most of the applications were dismissed with reference to Article 152 §§ 1 and 2 of the CCP. Thus, in a decision of 24 February 1998 the Varna Regional Court stated the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence and his detention was accordingly mandatory under Article 152 § 1 of the CCP. There were no grounds to apply the exception provided for by paragraph 2 of that Article, as a hearing had been listed in the trial against him, whereas his position with regard to the charges revealed a genuine risk that he might abscond or impede the course of justice.', \"34.  On 9 December 1998 the Varna Regional Court ordered the applicant's release on bail, holding that after seven years of detention and several rounds of investigation there was no risk of him jeopardising the investigation. There was furthermore no indication that he could flee or reoffend. The court also said that the length of the applicant's detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of the Convention. It set the bail at 2,000,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL)[1], without providing reasons as to the amount. Its order was not subject to appeal (see paragraph 54 below).\", '35.  The applicant was not released immediately as he was unable to secure the amount. Following an unsuccessful attempt to have it reduced by the court, he posted bail and was released on 17 December 1998.', \"36.  The applicant spent his time in custody (23 December 1991 – 17 December 1998) on the premises of the Varna Regional Investigation Service and in the Varna Prison. It appears from the documents in the case file and the parties' submissions that throughout the bulk of this time he was in the Varna Prison, and was kept in the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility during six unspecified periods (probably when the proceedings against him were pending at the pre‑trial stage), the latest of which ended on 10 June 1997. The parties did not specify the exact periods when the applicant was kept on the Investigation Service premises, despite being requested to do so after the case was declared admissible (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above).\", \"37.  At the relevant time, the cells of the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility had central heating and were each – save for two – equipped with an en suite toilet. Natural light came through glass tiles secured by metal bars. According to the applicant, the influx of natural light was limited. The detainees slept on plank beds. The applicant averred that at times he had been detained together with eight other persons in a cell measuring five to three meters. According to him, the ventilation system in the cell only worked for a few hours a day. He also stated that there was no open‑air exercise area on the premises. He was accordingly not allowed to take walks. Visitors were allowed only once a month. Food was of extremely poor quality.\", \"38.  According to the Government, the premises of the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility were relatively new, built in 1982, offered conditions better than those of the Investigation Service's detention facilities in other towns, and were in line with the minimum European standards. The Government did not comment on the number of inmates kept in the applicant's cell.\", '39.  The applicant submitted that in the Varna Prison he was kept in a cell measuring ten square meters, which he shared at times with three or four other inmates. According to him, during the nights they had to relieve themselves in a bucket kept in the cell. In 1992‑93 warm water for bathing was available once a week, whereas later, in 1998, a warm shower was possible only once a month with the result that he often had to take showers with cold water, which had a negative impact on his health. He was allowed to take walks for approximately forty minutes a day.', '40.  The Government did not comment on the conditions in the Varna Prison.', \"41.  During his time in custody the applicant was examined by a doctor on unspecified dates, apparently each time he was transferred from the Varna Prison to the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility, and was found to be physically healthy. However, in July 1998 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, for which he was treated in hospital between 14 July and 12 August 1998. Apparently he continued to receive medication for his illness after he was released from hospital. Reports on the applicant's mental health noted that he suffered from depression.\", \"42.  On 2 November 2000 the applicant issued a civil action against the Prosecutor's Office and the Varna Regional Investigation Service in the Sofia City Court. In his statement of claim he described the allegedly excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him and of his detention and pointed to the attendant negative consequences, such as a smear campaign against him in the press, a worsening of his health, the retention of the bail amount and a prohibition to leave the country. He alleged that this breached his rights under Article 5 of the Convention, his right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a trial within a reasonable time, and his right under Article 8 of the Convention to respect for his private life. He claimed 50,000 new Bulgarian levs (BGN)[2] in damages. He also requested the court to order the defendants to return the bail amount and allow him to leave the country.\", '43.  Following instructions by the court to specify his request for relief, in three additional memorials the applicant indicated that he requested BGN 20,000 for the breach of his right to a trial within a reasonable time, BGN 15,000 for the injury to his reputation resulting from the impression, stemming from the length of the proceedings, that he was guilty of the offence alleged against him, and BGN 15,000 for the impossibility to leave the country during the pendency of the proceedings. He also stated that his claim was under section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (see paragraph 56 below).', \"44.  In a judgment of 29 July 2002 the Sofia City Court dismissed the applicant's action, holding that the defendants, being part of the judicial branch, did not carry out “administrative action” within the meaning of section 1 of the above‑mentioned Act in performing their duties relating to the processing of the criminal case against the applicant. They could hence not be found liable for a breach of that provision. On the other hand, the applicant did not plead a breach of section 2 of the Act and there was no indication that at that point in time the facts alleged by him fell within its purview. Noting that the applicant had been exempted from paying the court fee up front, the court, acting in pursuance of section 10(2) of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (see paragraph 59 below), ordered him to pay BGN 2,000 in fees.\", '45.  Upon the appeal of the applicant, on 24 January 2003 the Sofia Court of Appeals affirmed with almost identical reasoning.', \"46.  The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation. In a final judgment of 23 December 2005 that court fully quashed the lower courts' judgments and awarded the applicant BGN 5,000 (2,556.46 euros (EUR)), plus interest as from 2 November 2000, the date of the filing of the action. It also ordered the defendants to pay the applicant's legal costs, amounting to BGN 1,340 (EUR 685.13). The court described in some detail the unfolding of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention, and found that the applicant's reliance on the provisions of the Convention was well‑founded. It stated that the length of the pre-trial detention had breached the law. It also found that at the material time and until 2003 Bulgarian law did not set any time‑limits for finishing the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings. The provision that controlled this was therefore Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which was part of domestic law. The period between 1991 and 2003 – throughout which the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined and during which the applicant could not use any mechanism to speed up the proceedings – was significant and exceeded the reasonable time for examining the case. In such situations, where national law did not provide a possibility to vindicate infringed rights, they could be vindicated under international treaties which had been ratified by Bulgaria and had become part of its domestic law. For instance, Article 13 of the Convention, thus applicable, required an effective remedy against any alleged violation of that Convention. The inaction of the investigation and the prosecution authorities and the courts had infringed the applicant's right to a trial within a reasonable time and had caused him non‑pecuniary damage. Taking into account that the applicant had sustained non-pecuniary damage on account of a pre-trial detention exceeding the time-limit provided by law and the failure to bring the criminal proceedings against him to an end between 1995 and 2003, and ruling in equity, the court considered that the damage could be made good by an award of BGN 5,000. It did not order the applicant to pay any court fees or costs for the remainder of his claim.\"], 'applicants': ['STAYKOV'], 'defendants': ['BULGARIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '6', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['36', '39', '40', '41', '46', '6', '60', '61', '66', '67', '68', '7'], '5': ['24', '57', '58', '90']}, 'silver_rationales': [14, 26, 29, 30, 31, 36], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [14, 26, 29, 30, 31, 36], 'explained_indices': [6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 0, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 30, 22, 32, 33, 34, 29, 21, 18, 19, 35, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 20, 36], 'explained_distances': [0.23113841, 0.14651865, 0.13971794, 0.12765384, 0.09825182, 0.08797282, 0.029662251, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085, 0.0127924085], 'number_of_sentences': 37, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

Police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate arrested the applicants on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), and placed them in custody on 28 and 29 April 1995 respectively. Both applicants alleged that they had been beaten and insulted by policemen on the way to the Security Directorate Building.\", \"11.  On 29 April 1995 the public prosecutor attached to the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the extension of the applicants' custody period until 9 May 1995.\", '12.  The applicants alleged that during their interrogation by the police, they had been kept blindfolded and forced to give information about persons they did not know. They were allegedly subjected to various forms of ill-treatment by police officers. They claimed they were beaten, strung up by the arms, threatened with death and given electric shocks.', '13.  On 2 May 1995 the applicants were allegedly forced to sign police statements about their activities in the PKK and their connections with other PKK members.', \"14.  On 5 May 1995 the applicants were examined by the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute's medical expert along with fourteen other detainees. In his report, the institute's doctor noted that there were no signs of beating, force or violence on the bodies of the applicants, whereas he had spotted certain signs of injury on the bodies of two other detainees.\", \"15.  On 22 May 1995 the first applicant underwent a second medical examination in prison. According to the prison doctor's report, the applicant had fading bruises on his body and ecchymoses on his left foot. The applicant was later transferred to Fatih Forensic Medicine Institute where another medical expert examined him. In a report dated 20 June 1996, it was concluded that the applicants' injuries, as cited in the report of the prison doctor, would prevent him from carrying out his work for two days.\", '16.  On 18 May 1995 the prison doctor also examined the second applicant. In his report, the doctor noted the presence of abrasions on the penis, pain in the chest and ecchymoses under the left eye. He also noted that the applicant had described a feeling of pain while chewing and pain on both shoulders.', '17.  On 5 May 1995 the applicants were brought before the public prosecutor attached to the Istanbul State Security Court. In their questioning they denied their police statements and rejected the allegations against them.', \"18.

In November 2009 (the exact date of his arrival was disputed in the domestic proceedings in Russia) he arrived in Moscow from Tajikistan for the last time and started working at the Dorgomilovskiy food market in Moscow. In 2009 the applicant joined an opposition movement, Vatandor (“The Patriots”), which united Tajikistani nationals living abroad and wishing to see certain reforms in the country. The applicant took part in meetings of Vatandor members in Russia. The applicant’s name was put on the membership list of that organisation; however, he was not given any documents confirming his membership of Vatandor.', '12.  On 26 March 2009 the Tajikistani authorities opened a criminal case against the applicant. He was accused of anti-government armed conspiracy. Specifically, the applicant was accused of being a member of several opposition movements responsible for armed riots – first, the “Bay’at” group and then the “Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan” (“the IMU”). His brother Barot was sentenced to imprisonment twice for membership of those groups and involvement in the riots. According to the Tajikistani authorities, in October 2007 the applicant took part in the construction of a military base in the mountains in Kyrgyzstan, near the border with Tajikistan, where the IMU kept firearms and ammunition. He took an oath of allegiance to the movement. The applicant was also involved in propagating the ideas of the movement amongst local youth.', '13.  On 30 March 2009 a formal statement of charges was issued against the applicant. He was additionally charged with supporting the IMU with the money he earned in Russia. The applicant was also accused of being involved in dealing in stolen cars in Moscow and the forgery of car documents. He sent the proceeds of this activity to Tajikistan to finance subversive activities there.', '14.  The applicant noted that there were two versions of the decision of 26 March 2009 to open a criminal case against him, as well as of the statement of charges of 30 March 2009. One version of the documents contained information apparently concerning another presumed member of the opposition, a Mr A. Abdulkhalikov. Furthermore, one version of the statement of charges against the applicant mentioned “stolen cars”, “forged documents” and “financing terrorist activities”, whereas another version did not contain that information.', '15.  On 30 March 2009 the Tajikistani authorities ordered the applicant’s detention on remand in absentia. In the detention order personal data of the applicant contained information apparently concerning Mr Abdulkhalikov. The detention order did not mention stolen cars, forged documents, or financing of terrorist activities.', '16.  On 22 March 2010 the Tajikistani authorities placed the applicant’s name on the international wanted list. In the international search request thus created the Tajikistani authorities placed the applicant’s own name in the column concerning his presumed accomplices.', '17.  On 3 September 2010, in the town of Khudjand, three police officers were killed and several people wounded in a terrorist attack. On 6 December 2010, in a press interview concerning the applicant’s arrest in Russia (see paragraph 21 below), the Minister of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan mentioned the applicant as one of the perpetrators of that terrorist attack. The applicant was defined as amir (the leader) of a terrorist cell operating from Russian territory.', '18.  In 2009-10 other suspected participants in the conspiracy were arrested in Tajikistan and stood trial there. Fifty-three people were convicted. One of them, Mr. Ismanov, was convicted inter alia of setting up “criminal contacts” with the applicant, and of transmitting “prohibited information” from the applicant in Russia to Tajikistan.', '19.  During the trial several of the accused complained to the court of ill‑treatment by law-enforcement officers in the course of the preliminary investigation. The applicant referred to the case of Mr I. Boboyev, who died during questioning at the police station in the applicant’s home town, and who he stated was his cousin. The applicant also cited the case of Mr S. Marufov, a member of the Islamic Revival Party, who he said had been tortured to death by police officers in the applicant’s home town. The applicant lastly stated that a Mr I. Ismanov had been tortured. The wife of Mr Ismanov had seen the traces of torture, and was prepared to testify to it before the national court, but the court refused to hear her.', '20.  On 8 December 2010 the Tajikistani authorities sent an extradition request to the Russian authorities. The extradition request was accompanied by assurances that the applicant would not be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment. He would have all opportunities to defend himself in Tajikistan, including the right to legal assistance. He would not be persecuted on political grounds, or because of his race, religion, nationality or political views. In addition, assurances were given that the applicant would be prosecuted only in relation to the crimes mentioned in the extradition request, that he would be able to leave Tajikistan freely after standing trial and serving a sentence, and that he would not be expelled, transferred or extradited to a third State without the Russian authorities’ consent.', '21.  On 3 November 2010 the applicant was arrested in the town of Dolgoprudniy in the Moscow Region, in connection with the international search warrant against him. He was questioned by the officers of the anti‑extremism department of the Russian police.', '22.  During the questioning he explained that he had come to Russia in November 2008 for work and that he had not applied for Russian nationality or sought political asylum. His documents were not in order; he claimed that he had lost his Tajikistani passport. The applicant alleged that his criminal prosecution in Tajikistan was politically motivated because of his membership of the Vatandor opposition movement.', '23.  On 4 November 2010 the Dolgoprudniy Town Court remanded the applicant in custody pending examination of the extradition request.', '24.  On 13 December 2010 the applicant requested the General Prosecutor’s office not to extradite him to Tajikistan, referring to imminent risk of ill-treatment there. He relied on reported cases of torture by law‑enforcement agencies in Tajikistan and the relevant case-law of the Court. The applicant argued that, being connected to the political opposition, he belonged to a vulnerable group and that his criminal prosecution in Tajikistan was politically motivated.', '25.  On 22 December 2010 the Dolgoprudniy Town Court extended the period of the applicant’s detention pending extradition until 3 April 2011.', '26.  On 25 December 2010 the applicant appealed, claiming in particular, that his detention was not justified, because the asylum proceedings he had initiated earlier (see paragraph 38 below) had a suspensive effect and he could not have been extradited before the completion of those proceedings. Therefore, there was no reason to detain him.', '27.  On 28 December 2010 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia informed the General Prosecutor’s Office that they did not see any obstacles to the extradition of the applicant to Tajikistan.', '28.  On 14 January 2011 the Moscow Regional Prosecutor wrote a letter to the immigration authority in connection with the applicant’s request for asylum. In this letter he asked the Migration Authority to keep him informed of developments in the applicant’s case, and indicated that the applicant’s extradition was “under the control of the President of the Russian Federation”.', '29.  On 27 January 2011 the Federal Security Service informed the General Prosecutor’s Office that they did not object to the extradition of the applicant to Tajikistan.', '30.  On 8 February 2011 the applicant’s appeal was examined and dismissed by the Moscow Regional Court.', '31.  On 29 March 2011 the Dolgoprudniy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 July 2011. On 1 April 2011 the applicant appealed against the extension. The applicant alleged, in particular, that if extradited he could be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. On 19 April 2011 the Moscow Regional Court confirmed the extension of the applicant’s detention.', '32.  On 23 June 2011 the Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia decided to extradite the applicant to Tajikistan.', '33.  On 29 June 2011 the applicant was informed of that decision. On the same day the Dolgoprudniy Town Court decided to extend the applicant’s detention pending extradition until 3 November 2011.', '34.  On 30 June 2011 the applicant appealed against the extradition order.', '35.  On 2 July 2011 the applicant appealed against the extension of his detention.', '36.  On 13 July 2011 Amnesty International issued a statement expressing concerns about the possible extradition of the applicant to Tajikistan.', '37. On 16 July 2011 the Moscow Regional Court upheld the extension of the applicant’s detention.', '38.  On 10 November 2010 the applicant applied for asylum in Russia. In the application form he indicated that he belonged to the Vatandor opposition political movement. During the asylum interview he specified that he was not an active member of Vatandor and did not attend their gatherings, but simply “shared their political views”.', '39.  On 2 December 2010 he supplemented his application for asylum and put forward the same arguments as in the extradition proceedings.', '40.  On 23 March 2011 his application for asylum was refused by the Migration Authority (“the MA”), on the ground that the applicant’s fears of persecution on political grounds in his home country were unfounded. He was formally notified of that decision on 5 April 2011. The MA concluded that the applicant had committed crimes on the territory of Tajikistan. The applicant belonged to organisations which had been banned by a decision of the Supreme Court of Tajikistan in 1993; therefore, his presence at the demonstration in 1995 in support of his arrested brother had been of itself a criminal act. The applicant’s allegation that one-third of the population of the town of Isfara had been prosecuted for their political views was, in the view of the MA, absurd, since there were not enough police officers in Tajikistan to prosecute so many people. The MA also concluded that the applicant’s membership of Vatandor was merely passive, and therefore that he was not at risk of ill-treatment in this connection. The MA found, in particular, that “it was certain that the applicant did not belong to any political, religious or civic organisations”.', '41.  On 25 April 2011 the applicant appealed, putting forward the same arguments as in the extradition proceedings.', '42.  On 17 June 2011 the applicant’s appeal against that decision was rejected by the Federal Migration Service.', '43.  On 9 September 2011 the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the MA not to grant him the refugee status in Russia.', '44.  The District Court noted, in particular, that in the previous ten years he had been travelling freely between Russia and Tajikistan, and that every year he returned to Tajikistan to visit his relatives in Isfara. The applicant had applied for asylum only after his arrest in Russia and not immediately at border control. The applicant’s closest relatives lived in Tajikistan undisturbed and did not leave the country. The court concluded that this demonstrated that the applicant had not been a victim of political persecution as he alleged.', '45.  As regards the applicant’s membership of Vatandor and his brother being a former leader of the United Tajik Opposition, the court noted that the applicant’s political involvement was not official, that he only shared their political opinions and did not attend meetings, nor did he engage in agitation. The mere fact that he had political views which were different from the government’s official position did not give him the right to claim asylum.', '46.  The court further noted that Tajikistan was a member of many international conventions, had an ombudsman, and respected human rights. As regards the references to other sources which cast doubt in Tajikistan’s human rights record, that information had been obtained from the mass media, was opinionated, and was therefore not objective.', '47.  The court held that he had not produced sufficient evidence of the risk of persecution for political reasons at home, and that Tajikistan complied with its international obligations in the human rights area.', '48.  The applicant appealed. On 30 November 2011 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal in a summary fashion.', '49.  On 16 September 2011 the Moscow Regional Court examined the applicant’s appeal against the extradition order. At the hearing the applicant was represented by a lawyer of his choice. The applicant denied committing the offences imputed to him and presented an alibi. The defence also claimed that if extradited to Tajikistan the applicant would be tortured, as many others accused of “religious extremism” had been. The defence referred in this respect to the relevant case-law of the Court and to numerous reports of international human rights NGOs and UN bodies competent in the field. The applicant also claimed that he had learned about the criminal prosecution against him only at the moment of his arrest in Russia. He also referred to numerous inconsistencies in the documents submitted in support of the extradition request by the Tajikistani authorities (see paragraphs 14-16 above).', '50.  The prosecution did not contest that the applicant belonged to the opposition movement and had been present at political gatherings. However, they drew the court’s attention to numerous inconsistencies in his submissions, cast doubt on the reliability of the sources of information relied on by the applicant, and stressed that the applicant was involved in a terrorist organisation.', '51.  Having heard the parties, the Regional Court upheld the extradition order. The Moscow Regional Court’s reasoning can be summarised as follows. The court observed that the applicant faced serious criminal accusations and that the acts imputed to him would in principle qualify as “crimes” under Russian law. It was not the task of the Russian court to establish whether the applicant was guilty of the impugned crimes. The court held that the inconsistencies in the Tajikistani documents were “technical errors” and did not affect the validity of the extradition request.', '52.  It was impossible for the court to establish when exactly the applicant had entered the territory of Russia for the last time, since the applicant’s own submissions in this respect were inconsistent, and there was no official information on the matter. However, the court found that it certainly had not been in November 2009, as the applicant had alleged. According to his original statement to the prosecutor, the applicant had been residing permanently in Russia since 2008. He had not applied for political asylum in Russia before his arrest. Although the applicant had lost his passport in 2010, he did not contact the embassy of Tajikistan to obtain a new one. During the interview the applicant was unable to indicate his exact address in Russia.', '53.  The applicant had a family in Tajikistan, which included his brother’s family and his first wife and children. They all lived in their family house. He regularly spoke to them on the telephone, and it was impossible that they would not tell him about the criminal prosecution. The court concluded that the applicant had been living in Russia permanently since 2008, that he had been aware of the criminal proceedings against him in Tajikistan, and that he had been hiding from the Tajikistani authorities in Russia.', '54.  The court did not find any evidence that the applicant’s case was “political”. At the first questioning he mentioned that he had come to Russia to find work, not out of fear of persecution. At the hearing the applicant stated that he had attended a political gathering in 1995, but that his role had been limited to giving a lift in a car to his relatives and taking them to the venue of the gathering. He denied having been involved in any political anti-governmental activity in Tajikistan. His activity in the Vatandor political movement was minimal: he simply shared their political opinions. The court observed that the applicant’s brother, Mr B. Azimov, was serving a prison sentence in Tajikistan; however, other members of his family, including his elder brother Mr R. Azimov, were all living in Tajikistan. The applicant’s first wife lived in Tajikistan with their five children and his second wife had been able to leave Tajikistan freely and come to Russia. His family owned ten hectares of orchards near a recreational zone. He was able for many years to maintain himself and his family with his earnings from selling dried fruit in Russia. The authorities thus did not interfere with his business interests or those of his family, despite the allegedly political underpinning of the case against him. His own testimony about the political nature of the prosecution was inconsistent. He first stated that the criminal case against him resulted from personal animosity between him and the chief of the local police following a quarrel in a café. Later in the court proceedings the applicant suggested that the criminal prosecution had been instituted so that his family’s land could be taken away.', '55.  The court also examined letters received from Amnesty International in support of the applicant’s cause, and noted that they did not contain anything which would point to the existence of a risk of ill-treatment to him personally.', '56.  The court finally analysed the institutional and legislative guarantees against ill-treatment which existed in Tajikistan, as well as its international obligations, and concluded that they were sufficient to guarantee that the applicant would not be subjected to any ill-treatment.', '57.  On 1 November 2011 the Moscow Regional Court ruled that the applicant’s detention would not be extended pending extradition, because the period of the applicant’s detention had reached the maximum established by law (twelve months). At the same time, the court indicated that since the applicant had been residing in Russia without papers, he could have been subjected to expulsion (administrative removal) proceedings and detained on that ground.', '58.  On 9 November 2011 the Supreme Court confirmed the validity of the extradition order and upheld the reasoning of the lower court.', '59.  On 2 November 2011 the prosecutor’s office forwarded the relevant documents in respect of the applicant to the police, who drew up a report on his illegal stay in Russia, which amounted to an administrative offence under Article 18.8 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”).', '60.  On the same day, the Dolgoprudniy Town Court of the Moscow Region examined the case against the applicant and found him guilty. The court established that the applicant had unlawfully resided in Russia from February 2010 until his arrest on 3 November 2010 with a view to extradition. The court imposed an administrative fine on the applicant, ordered his expulsion (administrative removal) from Russia and placed him in detention pending expulsion because of the gravity of the offence and because the applicant had no stable income in Russia. No specific time-limit for the applicant’s detention was given by the court. The court did not address his arguments about the risk of ill-treatment in the event of his deportation to Tajikistan.', '61.  On 3 November 2011 the public prosecutor ordered the applicant’s release from detention pending extradition, because the maximum term prescribed by law had expired. In the release order the prosecutor noted that an extradition check was in progress. The applicant was not released but was transferred to the Serpukhov Detention Centre for Aliens in the Moscow Region, according to the detention order issued in the course of the expulsion proceedings.', '62.  On 6 November 2011 the applicant’s lawyers appealed against this order to the Moscow Regional Court. They submitted that the court had refused to consider the applicant’s arguments concerning the possibility of ill-treatment in Tajikistan.', '63.  According to the applicant, during the night of 17 November 2011 he was visited in the detention centre by two police officers from the anti‑extremism department of the Ministry of Interior. They offered the applicant the opportunity to leave Russia for Tajikistan voluntarily, with a plane ticket provided by them. He was also photographed. It appears that the Dolgoprudniy Town prosecutor in charge of his case was not informed of that visit. Nor were the applicant’s lawyers informed thereof. The applicant declined the offer and was returned to his cell.', '64.  On 22 November 2011 the Moscow Regional Court adjourned the hearing concerning the expulsion order due to the failure of one of the witnesses, a police officer who had issued the administrative offence report, to appear.', '65.  On 6 December 2011 the Moscow Regional Court examined the appeal. The police officer did not appear at the hearing, but the court decided to proceed with the case. The applicant was not present at the hearing either, since the police had not arranged for him to be transferred from the detention centre to the court; however, his lawyer was present. According to the applicant’s lawyer, the judge told her that the court had no obligation to arrange for the applicant to attend in person. The court confirmed the validity of the expulsion and detention orders. The court did not address the arguments concerning the risk of the applicant being ill‑treated in Tajikistan. The court did not specify the period of the applicant’s detention with a view to expulsion.', '66.  On 4 May 2012 the applicant was transferred to the Lukhovitsy Detention Centre for Aliens in the Moscow Region.', '67.  On 1 August 2012, at the applicant’s representative’s request, the Russian Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed the following opinion on the risk of ill-treatment the applicant faces in Tajikistan:\\n“In accordance with numerous reports of international organisations as well as generally accessible information on the Republic of Tajikistan, because of mass violations of human rights and basic principles of international law by the Tajikistani authorities, including the principle of prohibition of torture, in particular, widespread practices of torture and ill-treatment by law-enforcement bodies, especially to extract confessions in criminal proceedings, violations of fair trial provisions, such as denial of access to legal counsel and lack of an independent judiciary, taking into account the fact that in Tajikistan the applicant is to be prosecuted in connection with criminal offences, the UN Refugee Agency considers that there exists a real risk of torture for the applicant in the event of his expulsion to Tajikistan.”'], 'applicants': ['AZIMOV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '20', '24', '39', '41', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '49', '51', '52', '53', '54', '60', '62', '65', '8', '9', '90', '91', '92', '93', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98'], '5': ['154', '28', '31', '57', '60', '61', '65', '80', '81', '83', '84'], 'X': ['4']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 22, 25, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 54, 55, 56, 59], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 22, 25, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 54, 55, 56, 59], 'explained_indices': [2, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 32, 31, 61, 29, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 60, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 16, 1, 0, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.10350919, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, 0.053471, -0.04771945, -0.090102464, -0.17353472], 'number_of_sentences': 62, 'article_id': 2, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1987 and at the time of the introduction of the application was detained in Lyster Barracks Detention Centre, Hal Far, Malta.', '6.  In 2001 the applicant’s parents fled to Eritrea, where she joined them in 2003. In 2004 the applicant married Abdi Mohammed Omar in Eritrea; a son, Ahmed, was born of this union on 24 June 2005. In 2008 the applicant left Eritrea, leaving her son in the care of her parents as it was too dangerous for her to travel with him. She has not seen him since.', '7.  After leaving Eritrea, the applicant travelled through Sudan and Libya. She entered Malta irregularly, by boat, on 5 February 2009.', '8.  Upon her arrival in Malta she was registered by the immigration authorities, given the identification number 09C-020 and served with a Removal Order under Article 14(1) of the Immigration Act, Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta (see Relevant Domestic Law, below), as she was deemed to be a “prohibited immigrant” under Article 5 of that Act. She was then immediately placed in detention at Ta’ Kandja Detention Centre pursuant to Article 14(2) of that Act, which stipulates that a person on whom a removal order is served “shall be detained in custody until he is removed from Malta” (see Relevant Domestic Law, below). According to the applicant, the said Removal Order did not contain specific reasons for her detention. The Government contested that statement. According to the applicant, in Ta’ Kandja she was placed in a dormitory with forty other people, including single women and children, with only occasional access to the adjoining yard for air.', '9.  On 18 February 2009 the applicant filled in a Preliminary Questionnaire, thereby registering her wish to apply for asylum under Article 8 of the Refugees Act, Chapter 420 of the Laws of Malta (see Relevant Domestic Law, below). However, the applicant was not sure about the content and purpose of the form since it was in English. At the time forms were simply distributed to asylum seekers by the Detention Service staff without any accompanying information. The Government explained that migrants used to interpret to each other in cases where some of them did not understand how to fill in the questionnaire and that several NGOs also assisted in filling it in. As the applicant could not read or speak any English, she relied heavily on fellow detainees to complete the form, both for practical assistance and for information as to what she should say. On the advice of fellow detainees, who were her only source of information about the asylum procedures in the circumstances, the applicant did not divulge the fact that she and the rest of her family were refugees in Eritrea, for fear that her application would be rejected and she would be sent back there.', '10.  According to the Government, the applicant was taken to receive primary health care on 15 March 2009 and medical appointments were fixed for her on 19 May and 20 June 2009.', '11.  On 27 March 2009 the applicant was called by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner to complete a formal application for recognition of refugee status in Malta and to attend an interview to present the grounds on which she was requesting protection. In her application and subsequent interview, the applicant repeated what she had said earlier, namely that her family was poor, there was no government in Somalia and that she had left because she could not find a job there. She did not attempt to remedy the situation by correcting the inaccurate information she had submitted earlier in the procedure.', '12.  On 9 May 2009 the Office of the Refugee Commissioner rejected her application for refugee status on the grounds that it failed to meet the relevant criteria.', '13.  The applicant did not appeal against that decision. Instead, a few days later, in May 2009 she escaped from detention. Sometime after her escape, she travelled to the Netherlands in an irregular manner. Upon her arrival in the Netherlands she immediately approached the authorities to ask for asylum. From there she was hoping to be able to go to Sweden in order to be reunited with her family (her father, siblings and minor son) who had been granted refugee status in Eritrea and were awaiting resettlement in Sweden. The family were eventually resettled there on 17 March 2011.', '14.  On 11 February 2011 the applicant was returned to Malta under the Dublin II Regulation and detained at Safi Barracks, despite repeated attempts by her lawyer to prevent her return to Malta. At the time of her return to Malta, the applicant was two months pregnant.', '15.  On 17 February 2011 the applicant was arraigned before the Court of Magistrates and charged with i) escaping from a place of public custody, namely Ta’ Kandja Detention Centre, on 17 May 2009; ii) as a person embarking or disembarking from Malta, making, or causing to be made, a false return, statement or representation and/or furnishing the Principal Immigration Officer with false information during the months prior to 17 May 2009; iii) in the same circumstances, in the Maltese Islands, knowingly making use of forged documents.', '16.  The applicant pleaded guilty to all of the charges. On the same day she was therefore found guilty as charged and sentenced to a period of six months’ imprisonment. As she was pregnant at the time, when giving judgment, the Court of Magistrates drew the attention of the Director of the Corradino Correctional Facility to this fact so that she would be given all the necessary medical attention that she might require in relation to her pregnancy whilst she was detained in prison.', '17.  Two days after the court judgment, on 19 February 2011, the applicant was admitted to hospital as she was very unwell. On an unspecified date she was discharged and returned to the prison, which, she alleged, had small cells and where she was subjected to constant passive smoking. She contended that she had suffered from a lack of medical attention while there. Shortly afterwards she was admitted to the Asylum Seekers’ Unit of Mount Carmel Hospital (also known as Ward M8B, the ward in the psychiatric hospital where male and female immigration detainees and female prison inmates are kept) for in-patient treatment. She miscarried in March 2011 while in Mount Carmel Hospital and subsequently contracted an infection for which she needed to be hospitalised for a period. She stated that the rooms in the ward were small with no space for exercise and that there were no proper blankets. She further alleged that the staff had failed to assist her when she had started bleeding, which had finally led to her miscarrying, and that her post-operation requests for drinking water were denied as were her requests for proper washing facilities.', '18.  On 17 June 2011 the applicant was released from prison, having served her sentence. She was placed in Hermes Block in Lyster Barracks Detention Centre (Zone C) with a view to her removal from Malta. During her time in detention she was never approached by the immigration authorities regarding her removal and had no way of knowing whether any proceedings were under way with a view to her removal. In practice, it is common knowledge that no deportations to Somalia or Somaliland have ever been effected. This is no doubt due in part to the UNHCR recommendation on return to Somalia (which relates primarily to South‑Central Somalia) as well as to the very real logistical difficulties inherent in such returns.', '19.  While in detention the applicant remained severely depressed. Her psychological distress was due to a number of factors, not least her prolonged detention, her miscarriage and the very limited prospects of being reunited with her son in Sweden. She described the conditions of detention as problematic, noting that although she had been placed with single women, they had been guarded by male officers (barring one female officer who had repeatedly abused Somali detainees until she was apparently transferred, following a complaint by the applicant); there were twenty-two persons in a room, which made it difficult to sleep; they were only allowed outside exercise for one or one and a half hours a day, and from April to July 2012 they were not allowed outside at all; they were fed chicken, pasta or rice on a daily basis and were not given any telephone cards.', '20.  The applicant approached the Jesuit Refugee Service (“the JRS”) for assistance in obtaining a review of the decision rejecting her application for international protection. On 23 September 2011 JRS staff wrote to the Refugee Commissioner requesting a copy of the relevant documents from her case file, such as the application form, interview notes and decision which she had lost when she escaped from detention.', '21.  On 10 October 2011 social workers with JRS Malta, who were monitoring the applicant in detention and offering psycho-social support, referred the applicant to the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (“AWAS”) with a view to obtaining her release from detention in accordance with government policy on grounds of her vulnerability due to her mental health, given her deteriorating psychological condition as supported by medical evidence (also submitted to the Court) (see below for details about this procedure).', '22.  On 16 November 2011 the documents requested by the applicant in September had still not been provided. Thus, she wrote to the Refugee Commissioner again, through the JRS, explaining some of the developments in her case since her interview and requesting copies of the documents relating to her first asylum application. She further requested a reconsideration of her application for asylum.', '23.  On 30 November 2011 the Refugee Commissioner informed the applicant of his unfavourable decision. Noting the difference between the facts as alleged by the JRS and those as presented by the applicant, he considered that on the basis of the information submitted by the applicant, as provided in her initial application and interview, she did not face a real risk of harm and did not satisfy any of the requisite criteria for the granting of temporary humanitarian protection.', '24.  The applicant was not given a copy of the documents she requested or allowed to make further submissions before that decision was taken. She was finally provided with a copy of the decision and the interview notes in her case at the end of February 2012.', '25.  On 14 February 2012, while still awaiting the outcome of AWAS’s assessment (see below), the applicant lodged an application with the Immigration Appeals Board (“IAB”) for release from detention under Article 25A(9) of the Immigration Act (see Relevant Domestic Law, below). In her application she claimed that her continued detention was no longer reasonable and requested the Board to order her release from custody in view of the fact that there was no reasonable prospect that the immigration authorities would be able to enforce her removal to Somalia within a reasonable time. In her application she also noted that, in practice, no one was ever deported from Malta to Somalia. She also submitted a social worker’s report attesting to the fact that her psychological health was suffering as a result of her prolonged detention and noting that she had also miscarried while in prison.', '26.  On 29 February 2012 the Principal Immigration Officer (who in effect was the Commissioner of Police) filed a response. He agreed with the facts as presented by the applicant. He further stated that, as the applicant had escaped from detention she now had to remain in detention, although it was not necessarily obligatory that she be held for eighteen months. Indeed she could potentially be released from detention earlier. Regarding the applicant’s psychological problems caused by her separation from her child, he noted that the applicant could avail herself of the provisions of the Dublin Regulation to request to be reunited with her son in Holland [sic]. Regarding the applicant’s request for release from custody, he noted that, in the first place, the applicant should never have escaped from detention in order to solve her personal problems. The time she had spent as a fugitive was time she had spent residing illegally in Malta and Holland, thus, her detention was a situation that she had brought upon herself and in consequence she should now be held in detention by law. Moreover, he considered that by escaping from detention without being medically cleared, as required by law, she had created a public health risk. Lastly, since she was receiving continued psychological care in detention he considered that her release from detention was not currently advisable.', '27.  The application was never set down for hearing by the IAB and no decision on the applicant’s request was ever delivered.', '28.  In the meantime, following a referral by the JRS, in December 2011 the applicant was interviewed by the Vulnerable Adults Assessment Team of AWAS with a view to determining whether she should be released from detention on grounds of vulnerability according to government policy. The person conducting the interview spoke in English. No interpreter was provided and although the applicant who had learnt some English managed to understand what was happening, she could not communicate fully or explain the full extent of her problems. The applicant was never formally informed of the outcome of this interview or of the decision taken regarding her request. However, some months later, she happened to see the woman who had conducted the interview at the Detention Centre, and, on enquiring, was verbally informed that her request had not been acceded to.', '29.  The applicant explained that the vulnerability assessment procedure operated by AWAS had been developed by that organisation in order to give effect to a government policy introduced in January 2005 which stated that vulnerable immigrants should not be detained. Although AWAS was not formally charged with responsibility for this procedure by law, in practice it had full responsibility for it. It was not regulated by law, however, or by publicly available rules or procedures. The determining authority did not give written reasons for its decisions and there was no possibility of appeal, although in practice it might be possible to request a review if more evidence was forthcoming or there was a deterioration in the individual’s condition.', '30.  The applicant was released on 30 August 2012 in line with government policy, as she had spent a total of eighteen months in “immigration detention” since her arrival in Malta.'], 'applicants': ['ADEN AHMED'], 'defendants': ['MALTA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['17', '39', '40', '41', '42', '51'], '5': ['123']}, 'silver_rationales': [12], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [12], 'explained_indices': [1, 3, 4, 12, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 25, 24, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 13, 2, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.27645218, 0.27004793, 0.1765691, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.16149086, 0.08122623, 0.054128647], 'number_of_sentences': 26, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

He is currently serving a life sentence in Schwalmstadt prison.', '6.  On 29 February 1984 the applicant was arrested after he had shot his wife, Ms I. M., who had recently left him, and injured two bystanders. On 17 December 1984 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court convicted the applicant of murder and negligent bodily injury and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He has been imprisoned ever since.', '7.  On 3 December 1993 the Marburg Regional Court determined that the applicant’s guilt was not of “particular gravity” pursuant to Section 57 (a) of the German Criminal Code (see Relevant domestic law below), implying that the degree of the applicant’s guilt did not require an execution of more than fifteen years of his sentence.', '8.  From November 1995 until March 1997 the applicant served his sentence in a semi-custodial regime (offener Vollzug). On 13 March 1997 this privilege was withdrawn after preliminary investigations were initiated against the applicant who was suspected of having, in January 1997, while on prison leave, caused bodily harm to a female acquaintance, Ms J., by using an electric truncheon. On 2 February 1999 the Frankfurt District Court acquitted him of these charges on factual grounds without giving any further written reasons.', '9.  On 23 February 1999 the Marburg Regional Court, sitting as an execution of sentence chamber (Strafvollstreckungskammer) rejected the applicant’s request to suspend the remainder of his sentence and to release him on probation. The chamber considered that the criminal proceedings before the Frankfurt District Court had failed sufficiently to clarify the facts of the incident of January 1997. Having heard evidence by witnesses, the chamber noted that the applicant had started a sexual relationship with Ms J., who was married, in autumn 1995. When Ms J. decided to terminate the relationship in November 1995, the applicant had threatened to tell her husband and children about her extramarital relationship. Based on testimony given by several witnesses, the chamber was further convinced that the applicant had attacked Ms J. in the evening of 10 January 1997. The chamber considered that the applicant’s submissions that he had not been in Frankfurt at the time of the alleged incident lacked credibility.', '10.  With regard to the prognostic decision, the decision reads as follows:\\n“The Chamber is convinced that a serious danger still emanates from [the applicant] for other persons’ lives and limbs. The established facts disclose remarkable similarities to the crime against I. M. The convict knew both women from his youth... Irrespective of the qualification of the incident under criminal law – which is irrelevant for the prognostic decision at hand – both incidents were preceded by a long period of time during which the perpetrator and the victim were deeply involved on an emotional level. The convict made elaborate plans for the future with both women, which ended in disappointment, and both women decided to leave him for another man...The convict was unable to take a clear stance in respect of the separation from both women. He oscillated between aggressive acts and menacing behaviour on the one side and pleadings on the other. In both cases, his behaviour followed the same pattern: it started with rather low-key aggression, which escalated during the course of the crisis which was marked by serious feelings of mortification....Now and then he threatened the women with violence and displayed suicidal tendencies... Ms J. might not yet have been in serious danger, as the convict had still been able to set himself limits. However, the Chamber has very serious doubts whether he will remain able to respect these limits in the future.”\\nThe Chamber further observed that the psychological expert Prof F., in an expert report prepared on 7 September 1994, had given the applicant a favourable legal prognosis. However, these findings had become obsolete in view of the freshly established events. The Chamber finally considered that the fact that the applicant had been acquitted in the criminal proceedings before the Frankfurt District Court did not prevent the execution of sentence chamber from making its own assessment of the relevant facts, as the Frankfurt District Court had failed sufficiently to examine those facts in a convincing way.', '11.  On 28 June 1999, the Frankfurt Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. That court considered that the principle of presumption of innocence did not prevent the execution of sentence chamber from examining on its own motion those facts that were relevant for its prognostic decision.', '12.  On 11 October 2001, the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant’s constitutional complaint. On 16 October 2001, the applicant lodged an application with the Court (no. 5598/02) in which he complained about his continued detention. On 6 April 2004, a Committee of three judges declared this application inadmissible.', '13.  Between February 2001 and November 2006, the applicant lodged four further requests for the stay of execution of the remainder of the sentence, which were likewise rejected by the domestic courts.', '14.  Since 2002, the applicant has again enjoyed relaxed conditions of detention (Vollzugslockerungen), like accompanied outings and therapy. Further relaxed conditions of detention were not granted because on 13 January 2004 the Hessian Ministry of Justice objected to the prison authority’s proposal in this regard.', '15.  By decision of 4 September 2007, the Kassel Regional Court, sitting as an execution of sentence chamber, and after having heard the applicant, rejected his request for a suspension of his sentence on probation. The court found that there was no real chance that the applicant would not reoffend if released. This finding was based on the psychiatric expert report submitted by Prof K. on 20 April 2007, which had found that the applicant continued to be dangerous. The Regional Court further found as follows:\\n“On the other hand, it has to be taken into account that the expert detected risk factors in the convict’s personality which make it difficult to come to an unconditionally positive social and legal prognosis... [The expert found] that these risk factors derived on the one hand from the fact that the convict had failed to deal with his offence, had not admitted any guilt and had not shown sympathy for his victims. In the expert’s view, he displayed a massive infantile egocentricity which was reflected in distinctive cantankerousness. While it was true that this would not necessarily lead to the commission of further criminal offences, the criminal offence that the applicant had committed to the detriment of Ms J. showed that the applicant was willing to enter into relationships with women once more and that a separation would lead to violent acts for reasons of wounded pride. His problem was that he was incapable of dealing either with his own weaknesses or with his catastrophic actions and that he could not take a mature, adult stance towards them”.\\n(“Anderenfalls war hierbei jedoch zu berücksichtigen, dass auch nach den Ausführungen des Gutachters in der Person des Verurteilten Risikofaktoren festgestellt wurden, die eine uneingeschränkt positive Sozial- und Legalprognose...erschweren. Diese Risikofaktoren ergeben sich zum einen daraus, dass der Verurteilte sich nach der Tat nicht mit seinem eigenen Tun auseinandergesetzt hat und weder seine eigene Schuld eingeräumt noch Mitleid mit den Opfern gezeigt hat. Bei ihm besteht nach Auffassung des Sachverständigen eine massive infantile Egozentrik, die sich in einer ausgeprägten Rechthaberei widerspiegelt. Zwar führe dies nicht notwendig zur Begehung weiterer Straftaten. Doch zeige die Straftat zum Nachteil der Frau J., dass der Verurteilte geneigt und imstande sei, wieder Beziehungen zu Frauen einzugehen und dass es bei Trennungen zu Gewalttaten aus gekränkter Eitelkeit komme. Seine Problematik bestehe darin, dass er auβerstande sei, sich mit seinen eigenen Schwächen, aber auch mit seinen eigenen katastrophalen Handlungen auseinanderzusetzen und diesen gegenüber einen reifen, erwachsenen Standpunkt zu gewinnen.“)', '16.  The Regional Court further considered that there was no need to obtain further expert reports. It observed, in this context, that it was part of the expert’s task to assess a factual situation from a medical point of view in order to deliver the requested prognostic assessment. The court observed that the risk associated with a suspension of the sentence on probation could only be taken once it was clear that the applicant would adhere to the norms and once his conduct had been tested for some time in the framework of relaxed conditions of detention, in particular in a semi-custodial regime. In this context, the court also welcomed that the applicant was now cooperating and it was thus envisioned to start individual therapy in September 2007.', '17.  On 13 September 2007, the applicant appealed against the Regional Court’s decision. He submitted, inter alia, that he had not received the Public Prosecutor’s observations the Regional Court had referred to in its decision and that his rights under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention were violated because the Regional Court had based its decision on the alleged incident with J., even though he had been acquitted of all charges in this respect. He further maintained that the decision could not be based on the lack of relaxed conditions of detention; otherwise, the court had an obligation to ensure that appropriate measures were taken.', '18.  On 9 October 2007, the Frankfurt Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the expert report, recalling the expert’s findings, inter alia, that the murder of his wife and the incident with Ms J., as referred to in previous decisions of the Regional Court and of the Court of Appeal, showed that with regard to women the applicant thought he could execute his own “law” at his discretion. He still did not accept his own weaknesses and did not have a plan on how to avoid or deal with critical situations in the future. Referring to its previous decisions of 1999, 2001 and 2005, the Court of Appeal concluded that the circumstances had not changed to a decisive degree. The murder of his wife was not triggered by the environment, but by the applicant’s personality. Since the criminogenic structure of his personality remained unchanged, the fact that the applicant’s conduct was non-objectionable was only of minor prognostic relevance.', '19.  The Court of Appeal observed that it had been legitimate for the execution of sentence chamber to investigate on its own motion the incident with Ms J., since this was relevant for the prognosis. Therefore, the expert was allowed to base his prognostic assessment on the execution of sentence chamber’s findings in this respect. According to the Court of Appeal, which referred to its prior decisions, this did not constitute a violation of the presumption of innocence. Having regard to the persistent danger that the applicant committed further violent acts in situations which could be compared to the original offence, the Court of Appeal considered that it was not justifiable to take the risk of suspending the further execution of the life sentence.', '20.  On 19 October 2007, the applicant submitted a constitutional complaint. He raised in particular the issue of presumption of innocence and further alleged that his right to be heard had been violated since he had not received the prosecution’s observations.', '21.  On 6 February 2008, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible for non-exhaustion of prior remedies on the grounds that the applicant had failed to lodge a motion to be heard (Anhörungsrüge).', '22.  On 19 March 2008, the Kassel Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s motion to be heard on the grounds that the applicant and his counsel had been informed about the content of the public prosecutor’s statement and of the prison authority’s submissions during a hearing. Furthermore, the prison authority’s submissions had been served on the applicant’s counsel for comments on 12 July 2007. On 5 June 2008, the Frankfurt Court of Appeal, relying on the same grounds, rejected the applicant’s appeal.', '23.  On 18 July 2008, the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s fresh complaint lodged on 12 May 2008 against the decisions given by the Frankfurt Court of Appeal on 9 October 2007 and by the Kassel Regional Court on 4 September 2007 for adjudication without giving any further reasons. This decision was served on the applicant on 29 July 2008.', '24.  On 21 January 2013 the Marburg District Court refused to order the applicant’s probationary release and, at the same time, instigated fresh proceedings on the review of the applicant’s continued detention. On 28 May 2013 the Frankfurt Court of Appeal confirmed.', '25.  Until July 2013, the applicant underwent therapy. He was granted prison leave to attend therapy lessons. As from March 2013 the applicant was additionally granted one or two prison leaves per week. Since 23 October 2013 the applicant is serving his sentence in a semi-custodial regime.'], 'applicants': ['MÜLLER'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['10', '15']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 10], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 10, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 20, 9, 8, 7, 6, 19, 5, 0, 3, 4], 'explained_distances': [-0.016564012, -0.06450939, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.118430436, -0.12261486, -0.13309097, -0.1363504, -0.14252704], 'number_of_sentences': 21, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

An investigator drew up an arrest record and, in detail, informed the applicant of his rights as an accused, including the right to have legal assistance and the right to remain silent. The applicant signed the record, noting that he clearly understood his rights, but he refused legal assistance and decided to make a statement.', '7.

On 10 March 2004 the Irkutsk Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. In view of the applicant’s position, the trial hearings were closed to the press and public. The conviction was based on self‑incriminating statements made during the pre-trial investigation, search records, expert examination reports and witness testimonies. According to the applicant, the trial court refused to hear Mr M. However, as noted in a statement of appeal lodged by the applicant’s co-accused, the trial court had heard Mr M. at least on two occasions: during the investigation phase of the trial, when he had testified and the parties had been allowed to ask questions, and when the trial court, having accepted the parties’ request, had again questioned Mr M. to clarify certain points.', '12.  The applicant alleged that the judgment of 10 March 2004 had not been pronounced publicly.', '13.  According to the Government, following the public pronouncement of the judgment, the Regional Court had notified the applicant of his right to appeal against conviction and had explained “procedural issues pertaining to lodging an appeal” to him. The Government provided the Court with typed notes signed by the applicant and his lawyer and certifying that they had been served with a copy of the judgment of 10 March 2004 and that the applicant had been informed of the ten-day time-limit for lodging an appeal. Another note submitted by the Government was handwritten by the applicant and showed that he had received a copy of the trial court’s records.', '14.  The applicant and his lawyer appealed against the conviction, having lodged lengthy appeal statements. They disputed the applicant’s involvement in the criminal offences he had been found guilty of and disagreed with the way the trial court had established the relevant facts, the distribution of roles between him and his co-defendant and the classification of his own acts. They submitted, in particular, that the trial court had disregarded the applicant’s testimony and statements by witnesses which supported it, in particular, regarding his submissions that he had committed the alleged act of drug trafficking whilst he had been undercover and acting within his official functions.

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Baku.', '6.  He stood in the elections to the National Assembly of 6 November 2005 as an independent candidate. He was registered as a candidate by the Constituency Electoral Commission (“the ConEC”) for the single-mandate Shamakhi Electoral Constituency No. 85.', '7.  On 29 October 2005 the ConEC held a meeting in the applicant’s absence and decided to apply to the Court of Appeal with a request to cancel the applicant’s registration as a candidate owing to reports of his engaging in activities incompatible with the requirements of Articles 88.1-88.4 of the Electoral Code. The ConEC relied on the following grounds.', '8.  Firstly, it noted that it had received a written complaint from a voter (H.S.) claiming that the applicant had given him money (in the amount of 300 US dollars) and asked him to promote the applicant’s candidacy among the population, offer money to voters in exchange for their votes, and disrupt his main opponent’s campaign.', '9.

In particular, one of the complaints by voters, sent to the ConEC by telegram, stated, in its entirety, as follows:\\n“[The applicant] and his supporters insult the current government and use offensive language in respect of other candidates, we ask you to take the necessary measures.”', '10.  Another telegram by a voter stated, in its relevant part, as follows:\\n“... during his meeting with voters in our village, [the applicant], instead of speaking about his election platform, insulted and spread calumnious rumours about [four other] candidates; such a candidate should be disqualified from the election if his actions are contrary to the election law, and what good can [the applicant] bring to the population, to the State; his candidacy should be cancelled ...”', '11.  There were several other hand-written letters or telegrams with a similar content.', '12.  The complaint by the candidate M.I. stated that the applicant insulted him at all his meetings with voters, using offensive language. M.I. further stated that on 28 October 2005 a large group of the applicant’s supporters, including his brother, had forcibly broken into a meeting room where M.I. was holding a campaign meeting with voters, disrupted the meeting, caused disorder and insulted M.I. using obscene language.', '13.  Another complaint was submitted by several highly-ranked members of the local branch of the Yeni Azerbaijan Party (“the YAP” – the ruling party, which, it appears, supported candidate M.I. in the election in question). They noted that the applicant’s supporters had disrupted M.I.’s meeting and subsequently “made for the streets and attempted to disrupt the peace and quiet of the town’s population”.', '14.  According to the applicant, on 28 October 2005 H.S. wrote a letter to the ConEC retracting his previous accusations against the applicant and explaining that he had made those statements owing to a personal disagreement with one of the applicant’s supporters and under the influence of emotion in the heat of the moment. In the following days, H.S. wrote similar letters to various electoral commissions and courts, retracting his accusations. According to the applicant, he also attempted to attend the Court of Appeal hearing concerning his disqualification (see below).', '15.  It appears that, on 29 October 2005, the Prosecutor’s Office of the Shamakhi Region commenced a criminal inquiry into allegations that on 28 October 2005 the applicant’s brother had resisted a police officer who was trying to restore order at a meeting of M.I. with voters, which had allegedly been disrupted by the applicant’s supporters. No information is available about the outcome of this inquiry.', '16.  The Court of Appeal examined the ConEC’s request at a hearing held on 31 October 2005. According to the applicant, although the hearing was officially scheduled to commence at 11 a.m., it actually took place at around 5 p.m. He had not received a written summons and was informed of the hearing orally only at around 2 p.m. on the same day, about three hours before the hearing. It was the first time he had been officially informed of the ConEC’s request of 29 October 2005 and that the Court of Appeal was considering the issue of his disqualification.', '17.  During the hearing, the applicant denied all the accusations against him, arguing that they had not been duly proved and, in any event, could not be a basis for cancelling his registration as a candidate. He noted that H.S. had retracted his accusations against him and had admitted that they had been false. He further noted that he had not been summoned to the ConEC meeting of 29 October and that the ConEC’s decision had not been made available to him. Lastly, he denied the accusation that his supporters had interfered with M.I.’s meeting with voters.', '18.  Having examined the written evidence submitted by the ConEC, which consisted mainly of copies of the above-mentioned written complaints by several voters, M.I. and local YAP members, the Court of Appeal considered that that evidence was sufficient to find that the applicant had breached the requirements of Articles 88.1, 88.2 and 88.4 of the Electoral Code, and it therefore cancelled his registration as a candidate.', '19.  The applicant appealed. Among other things, he complained that he had not been informed of the ConEC meeting of 29 October 2005 and that neither the ConEC decision nor any case materials had been officially made available to him prior to the Court of Appeal’s hearing. He further noted that it was in any case unclear from the relevant documents (which had been made available to him subsequently) whether the said ConEC meeting had taken place on 25 or 29 October, because the documents were contradictory and “falsified”. He claimed that all the alleged evidence against him had been fabricated in one day and that the allegations of his alleged wrongdoings were false and based on lies. He further complained that the Court of Appeal had not heard any of the complainants. As to the “complaints by voters”, the court had not even attempted to verify whether they had been authored by existing persons. Moreover, despite the fact that H.S. had sent a retraction of his accusations to the ConEC and the Court of Appeal and had personally attended the hearing, the court had refused to hear him.', '20.  On 5 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 31 October 2005. It found that the Court of Appeal had not committed any breaches of substantive or procedural law and that the applicant’s arguments were not supported by the material in the case file.'], 'applicants': ['ATAKISHI'], 'defendants': ['AZERBAIJAN'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-3'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-3': ['10', '11', '12', '13', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'explained_indices': [1, 5, 3, 0, 4, 6, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'explained_distances': [0.0008151316, 0.0007478391, 0.000637337, 0.00056740164, 0.0005412826, 0.00028627156, -4.2283442e-05, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934, -0.0001272934], 'number_of_sentences': 16, 'article_id': 12, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On 27 September 1999 he brought proceedings against his employer, claiming that his dismissal was unlawful and seeking reinstatement to work and compensation.', '6.  The hearing on 1 December 1999 of the Kardzhali District Court was postponed for gathering of evidence. On 1 March and 26 April 2000 the court instructed the applicant to correct certain flaws in his statement of claim. From 7 June to 5 July 2000 it conducted three other hearings and on the latter date postponed the hearing to 20 September 2000 for questioning of witnesses. The applicant made a complaint about delays. On 13 July 2000 the Kardzhali Regional Court established that the District Court had postponed the hearing of the case on a number of occasions for gathering of evidence. It noted that the District Court could have been more diligent in conducting the case in view of the nature of the claim. For example, it could have imposed fines on the parties for not submitting their requests in due course. It instructed the District Court to conduct the next hearing within one month as from the date on which the case file would be returned to it.', '7.  In compliance with the instructions, the District Court rescheduled the next hearing for 2 August 2000. On 7 August 2000 it held the last hearing and dismissed the claim. It held that the applicant had breached his duties as a foreman because during the night shift on 27 August 1999 he had exempted one of his subordinates from work without reporting his absence. The applicant appealed.', '8.  The Regional Court held two hearings and on 1 February 2001 quashed the judgment of 7 August 2000 and granted the applicant’s claim. It held that the procedural requirements for requesting explanations from the applicant had not been met by his employer. The latter appealed.', '9.  On 18 March 2002 the Supreme Court of Cassation conducted a hearing. In a judgment of 15 April 2002 it quashed the judgment of 1 February 2001. It held that the applicant’s employer had met the procedural requirements for taking explanations from the applicant.', '10.  On 17 May 2002 the Regional Court held a hearing. The applicant requested the assignment of an expert report. The hearings on 21 June and 13 September 2002 were postponed because the appointed experts had failed to submit their reports. Between 25 October and 6 December 2002 it conducted three other hearings and on 3 February 2003 dismissed the claim.

The applicant appealed.', '11.  The Supreme Court of Cassation conducted a hearing on 2 June 2005 and in a final judgment of 19 September 2005 upheld the judgment of 3 February 2003.

The applicants are husband and wife. They were born in 1920 and 1930 respectively and live in Sofia.', '7.  In 1982 the first applicant, who was an artist, purchased from the State through the Union of Bulgarian Artists a workshop of 212 square metres in Sofia. It appears that the second applicant, being the first applicant’s spouse, acquired a share in the property. The price, 17,680 “old” Bulgarian levs (BGL), was determined in accordance with the relevant legislation and paid by the first applicant. At the relevant time this sum was the equivalent of not less than 75 average monthly salaries.', '8.  In the following years the applicants made substantial alterations to the property. The applicants used the property as a workshop and as their home.', '9.  The property, located in a building constructed not later than 1946, had originally consisted of three separate premises which had become State property in 1976 and 1978, when a Mr A. and a Ms P., the owners, had each sold their premises to the State, through the Union of Bulgarian Artists. The transaction had been executed pursuant to Council of Ministers Decree no. 60 of 1975, at prices determined by the relevant regulations (see paragraph 19 below).', '10.  In 1992 the heirs of Mr A. and Mrs P. reimbursed the price their families had received in 1976 and 1978 respectively and, claiming that they had thereby restored their title to the respective parts of the property by virtue of the Restitution of Stores, Workshops and Storage Houses Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”), filed a rei vindicatio action against the applicants.', '11.  The proceedings went through three levels of jurisdiction and ended with a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 13 May 1997 ordering the applicants to vacate the property.', '12.  The courts noted that in accordance with the 1991 Act the former owners of real estate sold to the State under Decree no. 60 of 1975 could automatically restore their title by reimbursing the price they had received from the State. The restored owners were entitled to claim their property from any third person, even where the latter had acquired it by means of a valid transaction. The courts found that in the case at hand the plaintiffs had reimbursed the price their families had received in 1976 and 1978 and had restored their title. Under the 1991 Act the applicants were no longer the owners and had to vacate the premises. The fact that they had purchased the property in 1982 by means of a valid transaction was immaterial.', '13.  The relevant court judgments in the 1992-1997 proceedings, as well as the applicants’ notary deed, described the property as covering approximately 212 square metres on three levels: (i) basement, used as a workshop (75.24 square metres), (ii) art gallery (53.37 square metres) and (iii) upper level (83.24 square metres).', '14.  On 28 April 1999 the applicants were evicted from the property. They moved into a room of 12 square metres belonging to a friend of theirs, where they lived until 2001.', '15.  The applicants asked the Sofia municipality to provide them with a municipal flat for rent. The municipality agreed but proposed to the applicants, in April 2000, a squatted flat and later on a flat located below ground level, which the applicants refused as being unsuitable for occupation. Eventually, in December 2002 the applicants were granted the tenancy of a two-room municipal flat at regulated prices.', '16.  On an unspecified date in 1997 the applicants brought an action under section 2 § 1 of the 1991 Act, seeking compensation for improvements in the property from the heirs of Mr A. and Mrs P. By a judgment of 10 July 2000 the Sofia City Court awarded the applicants 34,462 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (the equivalent of approximately EUR 17,500) apparently on the basis of up-to-date market prices.', '17.  On 18 March 2003 this judgment was quashed by the Supreme Court of Cassation which referred the case for renewed examination indicating that the compensation should be in the amount of the expenses disbursed by the applicants for the reconstruction of their property, calculated with reference to prices as in force at the relevant time – the 1970s.', '18.  Thereafter the applicants abandoned the proceedings as it became clear that as a result of the devaluation of the Bulgarian currency, inflation and the Bulgarian courts’ practice of refusing revalorisation they could only hope to obtain a token compensation.

In April 1997 the authorities brought criminal proceedings against the applicant and a few other persons on suspicion of several crimes, including masterminding the murder of the applicant's business rivals.\", '9.  On 21 January 2000 the Military Court of the Moscow District (Московский окружной военный суд), sitting as a bench composed of one professional judge and two lay assessors, examined the case presented by the prosecution and acquitted the applicant and his co-accused on all charges for lack of evidence of his involvement in the alleged crimes (за недоказанностью участия в совершении преступлений).', '10.  On 26 January 2000 the prosecution lodged an appeal against the judgment of 21 January 2000, arguing that the first-instance court had wrongly assessed the evidence in the case and “failed to adopt measures aimed at achieving a comprehensive, full and objective investigation of all the circumstances of the case, to eliminate the inconsistencies in the prosecution case file and to have regard to all possible versions of events, but had pinpointed nonexistent inconsistencies for which the investigative authority allegedly failed to account”.', '11.  The prosecution suggested that the first instance court ought to have eliminated the inconsistencies in the prosecution case file of its own motion and requested the appeal court to remit the case for re-trial.', '12.  On an unspecified date the parties, including the applicant and alleged victims, filed their own arguments.', \"13.  By decision of 25 July 2000 the Military Division of the Supreme Court of Russia (Военная коллегия Верховного Суда Российской Федерации), sitting as a bench of three professional judges, examined and rejected the arguments of the prosecution and the alleged victims and upheld the judgment of 21 January 2000 in full. The court noted that:\\n“... Despite the arguments in the prosecution's appeal about the incomplete and one‑sided nature of examination of the case by the court, the judicial investigation was sufficiently thorough and comprehensive.\\nAll pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence were examined at the court hearing.\\nThe court ruled on all applications by the parties concerning the examination of the evidence, took all necessary measures to remedy the shortcomings of the investigation and eliminate the inconsistencies in the oral statements of the questioned persons, and as regards the questions requiring specialist knowledge decided to carry out and then carried out appropriate expert examinations.\\nAt the same time, having evaluated the evidence examined in its entirety, the court came to a reasoned conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to convict and that every means of collecting evidence in the court proceedings had been exhausted. In fact, this was confirmed by the prosecutor (государственный обвинитель), who did not make any application for a fresh investigation in court (судебное следствие) with a view to eliminating of the existing or newly discovered inconsistencies, and the prosecutor who took part in the appeal hearing ...\\nThe constitutional principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms in the administration of justice presupposes the separation of the function of consideration of cases from the functions of the prosecution and the defence submitting argument before the court. Thus, the task of prosecution before the court pertains to the prosecution bodies, whilst the court has an obligation to formulate conclusions about the established facts, regard being had to the evidence examined in the court hearing, to evaluate objectively the lawfulness and validity of the charges, to decide on the issue of acquittal or conviction, have due regard to the evidence collected by the investigation bodies and the arguments of the defence, thus securing the just and impartial resolution of the case and granting the parties equal opportunities to defend their positions. Hence, the court is empowered to determine the guilt of a person only on condition that it has been proven by the prosecuting bodies and officials. The lower court in the present case has fully complied with this requirement of the Constitution of the RF ...\\nHaving considered the evidence of guilt and innocence presented in court by the parties, the court came to the conclusion that it was insufficient to convict and that [the court] has exhausted all statutory means of collecting additional evidence, which is why it took a well-grounded decision to acquit [the applicant and two co-accused] for lack of evidence of their involvement in the criminal actions in respect of which they had been accused by the investigative bodies, having interpreted, in accordance with the requirements of the legislation and the Constitution of the RF, all doubts about the guilt in their favour.”\", '14.  On 25 August 2000 the Deputy Prosecutor General applied for supervisory review of the judgments in the case, arguing that the lower courts ought to have reacted to the breaches of the domestic law and various deficiencies in the prosecution case file by remitting the case for an additional investigation instead of acquitting the accused. He referred to, among other things, paragraph 2 of Article 232(1) of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure in this connection.', \"15.  On 13 December 2000, the Presidium of the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of nine professional judges, heard the parties, including the applicant and his counsel, and accepted the prosecution's arguments.\", '16.  The court stated that:\\n“... the Presidium finds that the prosecution appeal is well-founded and that it should be granted, as the preliminary investigation and the trial, despite the requirements of Article 20 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, were conducted in an incomplete and one-sided manner, without proper inquiry into incriminating and exculpatory circumstances. ...”', '17.  The court pointed out several breaches of the domestic procedure by the investigating authorities and various inconsistencies in the prosecution case file and gave a number of detailed instructions as to how these deficiencies should be eliminated.

Investigator A., from the investigation unit of the Sosnogorsk police department, opened a criminal case into the robbery.

On the same day investigator A. reopened the criminal proceedings.', '8.  On 26 August 2005 the police arrested B., Zh. and the applicant. Investigator A. was present at the time of the arrest. The three men were taken to the Sosnogorsk police department of the Komi Republic (отдел внутренних дел г. Сосногорска Республики Коми).', '9.  Police officers, in particular Z., the head of the criminal police division of the Sosnogorsk police department, interviewed the applicant about his involvement in the robbery. According to the applicant, they demanded that he confess to the robbery and G., an operative officer in the criminal investigation unit of the police department, punched and kicked him on different parts of his body. Fearing new violence, the applicant confessed to having participated in the crime as requested, and signed a record of his “surrender and confession” (явка с повинной) that had been drawn up by operative officer G. at Z.’s request.', '10.  According to that record, on 26 August 2005 in office no. 12 of the Sosnogorsk police department police officer G. obtained from the applicant his confession to the crime, in accordance with Article 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (“CCrP”). In particular, the record stated that the applicant had assisted B. and Zh. by loading the property stolen from the shops into his car and transporting it; that he had confessed without any physical or psychological pressure being exerted on him; and that he had been informed of Article 51 of the Constitution.

In reply to the judge’s question about the origin of his facial injuries, the applicant stated that he had been beaten up by operative officers from the police department. On the same day the applicant’s legal-aid counsel, who was representing the applicant at the court hearing, lodged an application with the Sosnogorsk prosecutor in which he requested that an inquiry be conducted into the applicant’s complaint and that those responsible for his ill‑treatment be prosecuted.', '16.  On 31 August 2005 the applicant was placed in pre‑trial detention facility SIZO 11/2, where he was examined by a doctor and found to have bruising beneath his eyes, a swollen nasal bridge, two-centimetre abrasions on the right side of his forehead, hematoma on the left side of his lower jaw and abrasions on the small of his back and right knee (as recorded in a certificate of that detention facility dated 29 September 2005).', '17.  On 5 September 2005 the applicant’s counsel requested investigator A., who was in charge of the robbery case, to order a forensic medical examination (судебно‑медицинская экспертиза) of the applicant. The investigator rejected the request as irrelevant to the robbery case.', '18.  Following the application by the applicant’s counsel (see paragraph 15 above), investigator V. of the Sosnogorsk prosecutor’s office carried out a pre‑investigation inquiry into the alleged ill‑treatment of the applicant.', '19.  On 5 September 2005 the investigator ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant; this was carried out by the Ukhta Forensic Medical Bureau on 7 September 2005. The expert’s report stated that the applicant had the following injuries: bruises measuring up to 1 to 3.5 centimetres on the lower eyelids of both eyes, two abrasions measuring 4 to 0.6 and 1.5 to 0.2 centimetres on his back; and an abrasion measuring 0.6 to 0.5 centimetres on his right knee. The injuries could have been caused by impacts from blunt hard objects with a limited contact surface, in the period 8-12 days before the examination. They could not have been caused by a single impact as a result of a fall against a flat surface.', '20.  The investigator received “explanations” (объяснения) from investigator A. (responsible for the robbery case) and from the police officers who had taken the applicant to the police station and interviewed him about his involvement in the robbery. In particular, police officer G. stated that in the course of a “conversation” (беседа) which he had had with the applicant, the latter had suddenly jumped to his feet and hit his head against the wall, as a result of which his nose had started bleeding. Police officer K. also stated that he had seen the applicant hitting his own head against the wall. Police officer Z. explained that in the course of his “conversation” with the applicant the latter had recounted the details of the robbery committed by him; that the applicant had explained that he had hit his own head against the wall and that he had no complaints against police officers; and that the applicant had entered this explanation in the police station visitors’ registration log.', '21.  On 9 September 2005 investigator V. held that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, in particular the claims that he had been struck “in his kidneys” and pushed so that his face had hit the wall and he had fainted, had not been based on real facts and that no criminal case was to be opened against police officers G., Z., Ku., B. and M., pursuant to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the CCrP (lack of the elements of a crime in the impugned acts).', '22.  On 5 December 2005 the Sosnogorsk prosecutor set aside the investigator’s decision of 9 September 2005 as unlawful and unfounded, on the ground that the circumstances in which the applicant had received his injuries had not been reliably established. He referred to the description of the applicant’s injuries on his arrival in the IVS (see paragraph 13 above) and the SIZO (see paragraph 16 above) and his examination by the forensic medical expert (see paragraph 19 above). He stated that the expert’s suggestions as to how the injuries had been sustained made it doubtful that the applicant could have received his injuries as a result of a one-off impact by his face against a wall. The prosecutor further noted that the applicant had explained that he would most likely be able to identify the police officer who had beaten him at the police station. However, it was not possible to carry out an identification parade and a confrontation in a pre‑investigation inquiry. The prosecutor considered that it could not be ruled out that, after his arrest, the applicant had been subjected to acts of violence in order to make him confess to the crime. The applicant’s version of his ill‑treatment by the police officers could only be verified by way of a full investigation. In order to do so it was necessary to open a criminal case, given that there was sufficient information disclosing elements of a crime under Article 286 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code (official misconduct with the use of violence). The prosecutor ordered that a criminal case be opened.', '23.  In the course of the ensuing investigation the police officers who had arrested the applicant were questioned as witnesses. The applicant was questioned as a victim. An additional forensic medical expert’s report was obtained on 15 February 2006. It reiterated the conclusions in the previous report (see paragraph 19 above).', '24.  On 4 March 2006 an investigator from the Sosnogorsk prosecutor’s office terminated the proceedings for lack of the elements of a crime in the acts of the police officers, pursuant to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the CCrP.', '25.  On 30 June 2006 a deputy prosecutor of the Komi Republic set aside the investigator’s decision and reopened the criminal proceedings. Three further decisions to terminate the proceedings were subsequently taken and then set aside as unfounded and based on an incomplete investigation. In one of the decisions, dated 24 November 2006, the deputy prosecutor ordered that the inconsistencies between the statements of the police officers and that of the applicant be eliminated and that identification parades and confrontations be held, if necessary. When questioned again as a victim, the applicant stated, inter alia, that he remembered that police officer G. had hit his head against the wall and started punching him “in the kidneys” (as stated in a decision to terminate the proceedings of 4 January 2007).', '26.  The most recent decision to terminate the proceedings for lack of the elements of a crime under Article 286 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code in the acts of police officers G., Ku. and B. was taken on 1 April 2007. The investigator concluded that the applicant’s allegations had been refuted by police officers G. and K., who stated that the applicant had hit his own head against the wall; by the record of his surrender and confession and the forensic medical report of 15 February 2006, in that the applicant’s injuries could have been sustained as a result of impacts from blunt hard objects with a limited contact surface. It does not appear from the decision that investigative acts such as identification parades and confrontations with the applicant’s participation were carried out.', '27.  At a preliminary hearing held by the Sosnogorsk Town Court on 13 April 2006 the applicant’s counsel requested that the record of the applicant’s surrender and confession of 26 August 2005, on which the prosecution relied, be excluded from evidence pursuant to Article 75 § 2 (1) of the CCrP, as it had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer. The Town Court dismissed the request.', '28.  At his trial, the applicant pleaded his innocence and submitted that he had written his confession statement on the instructions of police officer Z. as a result of physical and psychological coercion by the police officers; in particular, police officer G. had beaten him “in the kidneys and liver” and his head had been struck against the wall so that he had fainted. He had not been informed of his right under Article 51 of the Constitution not to give self‑incriminating statements, as that part of the record had been added by police officers at a later stage. The applicant asserted, in particular, that on the night of the robbery he had arrived at the commercial centre, by car and at B.’s request, and had towed B.’s car until its engine started, without knowing anything about the robbery. Two months later B. had offered him gold jewellery, allegedly belonging to B.’s acquaintance, for sale. The applicant had returned some of the jewellery to B. and kept the rest for himself. He had understood from police officer Z. that the gold which he had received from B. had been stolen from the Sosnogorsk district commercial centre. He had therefore told Z. about the gold he had kept at his home.', '29.  The applicant’s co-defendant Zh. pleaded his innocence, asserting that he had given self-incriminating statements as a result of his ill‑treatment by police officers, in particular by G., who had allegedly beaten him up, kicked him and burned his fingers with a cigarette; he also stated that after his arrest on 26 August 2005 he had seen the applicant, on his knees and bleeding, at the police station.', '30.  The applicant’s co-defendant B. admitted before the trial court that he had committed the robbery together with a certain Ch., and stated that the applicant and Zh. were innocent. In particular, B. stated that on the night of the robbery he had called the applicant, asking him for help because his car had broken down; the applicant had arrived by car as requested, towed B.’s car (with the stolen property inside) until the engine started and then left without knowing anything about the robbery. Two or three months later, since he was experiencing difficulties with storing and selling the stolen property, B. had asked the applicant to look after the gold jewellery and to buy some of it if he wished. The applicant had agreed. B. also stated that he had not given any self‑incriminating statements during the preliminary investigation, in spite of the physical violence used against him by the police officers, in particular by G.', '31.  The applicant’s wife stated, among other things, that on the day of his arrest the applicant had been taken back to their home by the police officers in order for their flat to be searched. He had had an abrasion on his head, his lip was burst and his nose was swollen.', '32.  Police officer Z., examined by the trial court as a witness, stated that he and other police officers had arrested the applicant and his two co‑defendants after B.’s girlfriend had reported their involvement in the robbery. At the police station he had talked to the applicant about the robbery several times. The applicant had confessed, named his accomplices and expressed his readiness to surrender the stolen gold. Z. had suggested that the applicant write a statement of his surrender and confession. The applicant had agreed and Z. had asked his subordinates to prepare the necessary document. No violence or threats had been used against the applicant.', '33.  Police officer G. stated that after the applicant’s arrest he had taken the applicant to the police station. The applicant had been taken to Z.’s office and later Z. had requested G. to obtain from the applicant a statement of his surrender and confession. The applicant had written down his statement and signed it. G. had not used any violence against the applicant. G. had come out of his office to register the statement with an officer on duty, while the applicant had stayed with police officer K. On returning to his office, G. had seen the applicant suddenly jump to his feet and strike his head against the wall. The applicant had fallen to his knees and started bleeding, “probably from his nose”. K. had given him a towel and asked whether he needed a doctor. The applicant had answered negatively. Z. had then taken the applicant to his office again.', '34.  Police officer K. stated that the applicant had jumped to his feet and struck his forehead against the wall once and then had fallen to his knees. K. had wanted to call a doctor but the applicant had refused. He had given the applicant a towel because the applicant was bleeding. K. denied any violent behaviour on the part of the police officers.', '35.  Investigator A. stated that she had investigated the robbery case and had given instructions (отдельные поручения) to the police officers in the criminal investigation unit of the Sosnogorsk police department. She had not instructed them to question the applicant or to collect a statement of his surrender and confession. Police officer G. had obtained the applicant’s statement of his surrender and confession as a result of the applicant’s free will. When questioning the applicant as a suspect (on 27 August 2005, see paragraph 14 above) she had noticed his injuries and asked if he had needed medical assistance, but he had refused.', '36.  The applicant’s counsel maintained before the trial court that the applicant’s statement of his surrender and confession, which he had retracted on the following day when questioned for the first time in the presence of a lawyer, should be declared inadmissible evidence. She noted that investigator A. had drawn up the record of the applicant’s arrest as a suspect on 26 August 2005. However, for unknown reasons she had not questioned him as a suspect on the same day. Instead, the police officers had obtained the statement of his surrender and confession on their own initiative, without any such instruction from the investigator. They had done so using psychological and physical coercion, as confirmed, inter alia, by the statements of Zh. and the applicant’s wife (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above), the certificate from detention facility IZ-11/2 (see paragraph 16 above) and the forensic medical expert report of 7 September 2005 (see paragraph 19 above). Furthermore, his confession statement had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer. Under Article 142 § 1 of the CCrP, a statement of one’s surrender and confession was meant to be voluntary. Therefore, if obtained from a person arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, any such statement should be subjected to particular scrutiny. Its voluntary nature was ensured through procedural guarantees under Articles 46 (“The suspect”) and 51 (“Compulsory participation of counsel for the defence”) of the CCrP. Otherwise, such a confession statement should be declared inadmissible evidence in accordance with Article 75 § 2 (1) of the CCrP.', '37.  In its judgment of 6 December 2007 the Town Court held that the applicant’s allegation that the statement of his surrender and confession had been given under duress was unsubstantiated. It relied on the statements by the police officers, denying any wrongdoing on their part (see paragraphs 32-34 above), the investigative authority’s most recent decision to terminate the criminal proceedings against them which, as the Town Court noted, had been taken in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure and had not been revoked or quashed (see paragraph 26 above), and a report from an internal police inquiry which had dismissed the applicant’s allegations of ill‑treatment.', '38.  The Town Court held that it had critically assessed the applicant’s statements at the trial and concluded that they represented the position of the defence, in that they were aimed at evading criminal responsibility. Those submissions had been refuted by his and Zh.’s statements of surrender and confession, as well as by the statements by the following witnesses: B.’s girlfriend, who had provided hearsay evidence about the applicant’s involvement in the robbery; five police officers who had participated in the applicant’s and his co-defendants’ arrest or the operative follow-up, in particular Z., G., and K.; investigator A., in charge of the robbery case; Z.A., who had denied seeing the applicant in the porch of his building on the night of the robbery (where, according to her former boyfriend who had been heard by the court as a witness for the defence, she had spent time that evening), and her mother Z.E., who had stated that Z.A. had not gone out after 9 p.m.; and Kh., who had been an attesting witness during the search at the applicant’s home during which certain items were seized.', '39.  The Town Court held that it had based its judgment on the statements of surrender and confession given by the applicant and Zh., along with statements by the victims, the prosecution witnesses and other evidence. It found that on 12 April 2005 B., Zh. and the applicant had entered into a conspiracy to commit theft from the shops in the commercial centre. According to the roles agreed on between them, the applicant had remained on guard in his car outside the commercial centre, while B. and Zh. had entered while the centre was still open and had hidden there. During the night they had attacked a woman guard and tied her up. Then they had forced locks and stolen property, in particular jewellery and mobile phones. The applicant had helped them to carry the stolen property out and load it into his car, in which they all had left.', '40.  The Town Court convicted the applicant of high-value theft with unlawful entry, committed in conspiracy by a group of persons, and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. In sentencing the applicant the Town Court took into account information about his personality, in particular that he had received positive character references from his places of residence and employment, and that he had no criminal or administrative offences record. It considered his statement of surrender and confession, the fact that he had two minor children and that he had voluntarily surrendered the stolen gold jewellery, as well as his health condition, as mitigating circumstances. B. and Zh. were convicted of robbery with the use of violence and sentenced to nine years’ and eight and a half years’ imprisonment respectively. The Town Court granted the victims’ civil actions and ordered the applicant and his co-defendants to pay 396,800 Russian roubles (RUB) jointly in respect of pecuniary damage. The victims’ remaining claims were to be examined in separate civil proceedings.', '41.  The applicant and his counsel appealed against the judgment. His counsel argued, inter alia, that the trial court had based its judgment on inadmissible evidence, in particular the statement of the applicant’s surrender and confession of 26 August 2005, which had been given by him as a result of ill-treatment by the police officers and in the absence of a lawyer. She reiterated the arguments put forward before the trial court (see paragraph 36 above).', '42.  On 6 June 2008 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic examined the case on appeal. It endorsed in full the trial court’s decision concerning the admissibility of the statement of the applicant’s surrender and confession. It held, in particular, that the statement had been obtained in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Article 142 § 1 of that Code, a statement of surrender and confession was a voluntary statement by a person about a crime committed by him. It had not therefore been necessary to have an instruction from an investigator in order to obtain it. The law did not provide for any additional requirements to such a statement, save that the individual concerned was to be warned of his or her criminal responsibility for deliberately giving false information. Therefore, the absence of a lawyer had not rendered the statement unlawful and had not violated the applicant’s right to defend himself. He had been informed of his right under Article 51 of the Constitution, as confirmed by his signature on the record of his surrender and confession.', '43.  The Supreme Court of the Komi Republic further noted that the trial court had examined as witnesses all of the police officers who had seen the applicant at the police station with a view to verifying their implication in the alleged crime. They had all denied any wrongdoing. It had been established that, having written his confession, the applicant had suddenly jumped to his feet and hit his head against a wall. The Supreme Court also referred to the most recent decision by the investigative authority, dated 1 April 2007, by which the criminal proceedings against the police officers had been terminated (see paragraph 26 above), and to the results of the internal police inquiry dismissing the applicant’s allegations of ill‑treatment (see paragraph 37 above). It upheld the judgment.', '44.  The applicant’s counsel unsuccessfully raised the issue of the admissibility of the record of the applicant’s surrender and confession in her requests for supervisory review of the case before the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The former court rejected it for the same reasons as before (decision of a judge of the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic of 5 September 2008 dismissing the request, as endorsed by the President of that court on 27 October 2008).', '45.  The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation similarly stated that the applicant’s argument – that the statement of his surrender and confession had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer – lacked a basis in domestic law, and that the allegation of the applicant’s ill‑treatment at the hands of the police was unsubstantiated, as shown through its examination by the trial court which had heard the police officers, particularly Z., G. and B. (decision of a judge of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 22 December 2008 dismissing the request for supervisory review, as endorsed by a Deputy President of the Supreme Court on 10 March 2009).'], 'applicants': ['TURBYLEV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['13', '14', '15', '16', '19', '22', '25', '26', '60', '62', '66'], '6': ['10', '12', '32', '36', '37', '38', '39', '42', '44', '46', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '56', '6', '65', '66', '7', '74', '8']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 21, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 39], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 21, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 39], 'explained_indices': [20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 21, 39, 40, 18, 6, 7, 8, 19, 10, 11, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 12, 0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.036270708, 0.026174724, 0.023426235, 0.020629019, -0.0498735, -0.18172619, -0.21119559], 'number_of_sentences': 41, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The first applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Tarnów. The second applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Lisia Góra. The first applicant is a journalist working for TEMI, a local weekly newspaper published in Tarnów. The second applicant is the editor-in-chief of that weekly.', '6.  TEMI published a series of six articles entitled “Marek C. in episodes” which were written by the first applicant. Marek C. [M.C.] was a local councillor and vice-chairman of the Tarnów Municipal Council. In the issue of 28 January 2004 the weekly published the first article about M.C. It began as follows:\\n“M.C. is certainly a colourful character. This Tarnów councillor, serving his third mandate on the municipal council, tried to become the President of Poland and a member of the Senate. Currently, he is involved in many court cases and is again becoming the subject of scandals.\\nEveryone remembers well that at the beginning of winter Councillor C. was involved in the eviction of two pregnant women from a flat located at ... Street in Tarnów. Everyone also remembers the explanation of C. who described one of the evicted women as running a shebeen and suggested that she together with her daughter were women of easy virtue. ...\\nPeople don’t want to speak about C. And if they do, they speak about him as if he were dead – either well or nothing. Otherwise they risk to be taken to court and charged with defamation or breach of his personal rights. The list of persons who have met him in a courtroom is long and new names appear on it all the time. ...”\\nIn the subsequent part of the article the first applicant described M.C.’s career as a local politician. Basing herself on information received under conditions of anonymity from M.C.’s former collaborators and fellow councillors, she portrayed him as an overbearing, self-centred and ruthless person. She further stated that M.C. had been involved in many, mostly unsuccessful, political ventures and after every lost election he created a new political grouping.', '7.  In the issue of 4 February 2004, the weekly published the second article in the series. It read as follows:\\n“For years the activity of M.C. has been based on balancing on the edge of the law, and even on breaking it. C. is most frequently accused of denigrating people and undermining their authority and of disseminating untruthful information about them. This includes information which suggests corruption links between people whom C. dislikes for reasons exclusively known to him. And that is how the articles and paragraphs of the Criminal Code which are being breached by councillor C. – without much notice on his part – proliferate.\\nColleagues on the [municipal] council\\nPeople still don’t want to speak about C. Are they afraid? Of what? Z.J., formerly for many years chairman of the Tarnów Municipal Council, refused to speak. Similarly, J.R., former mayor, did not want to say anything. (...)\\nHowever, A.K., the current chairman of the Municipal Board spoke:\\n“M.C. is a very touchy person, often he does not weigh his words. Even if a mild opinion is expressed about him, he still considers himself to be offended. At the same time he uses words which in the language of people with at least a minimum of good manners are considered inappropriate. I said already once to Mr C. that his character was not oriented on construction, but on destruction. (...)”\\nMayor M.B. does not want to comment on councillor C.’s behaviour. He says that not because he is afraid, but because he thinks that there is nothing to comment on:\\n“Cooperation with this councillor is entirely out of the question. From his part there is only constant criticism, attack, and most frequently without any order, repetition of the same arguments. Mr C. criticises everything and all the time. ...\\nDesk for the councillor M.C. has ambitions and plans. He wants to become the President of Poland, or mayor of Tarnów, or a member of parliament. And if there are no elections, then he applies for the job of director of the Żabno Cultural Centre. There also without success. Everywhere and on every occasion he promises something. Up to now it would be difficult to find in his CV any positive achievements or just partial fulfilment of his various promises, including the electoral ones.\\nSometimes C. attempted to get other “inferior” positions, compared to a chair in the presidential palace. For example, the mayor’s plenipotentiary for the establishment of a university in Tarnów. It was being said that an agreement on the taking of this position by C. would be one possible way of calming the political excesses of the councillor. He did not get the position. Unofficially it was being said that similar arguments [were raised] when C. attempted to get another job, namely that of deputy head of the municipal police in Tarnów. This also failed. ... And could it be that his venomous aversion to the media, and in particular to the largest weekly in the region, is the result of its refusing his offer to become the editor in chief of the paper, or is that just a coincidence?\\nCouncillor – offender?\\nRecently C. again lost a court case; this time against a journalist of the local Radio Maks, M.K. The case concerned allegations made by councillor C. against the Tarnów radio journalist. It is interesting that despite having found C. guilty and additionally ordering him to pay PLN 500 to a children’s home, the court conditionally discontinued the proceedings for a probationary period of one year, not sentencing him. A sentence for Marek C. would have meant the loss of his position as a councillor.\\nThat was obviously not the first proved case of C.’s breaking the law. It is just worth recalling that in 2001 the State Electoral College rejected his financial report from the presidential campaign. As a consequence of the breach of the electoral law, the Warsaw Regional Court ordered the forfeiture of some donations paid to C.’s electoral committee.\\nThe apex of the offending activities (apogeum przestępczych poczynań) of Marek C. was the recent disclosure of confidential information from court proceedings instituted against C. by Radio Maks. It turns out that the hearing was conducted in private.\\n“Dissemination of any information from such a hearing without authorisation is an offence under Article 241 § 2 of the Criminal Code. This offence entails mandatory prosecution and is subject to a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding two years, a fine or a restriction of liberty” B.O., spokesperson for the Tarnów prosecution service, told TEMI.\\nThe information that a hearing is conducted in private is announced at the beginning of the hearing by a judge who is also required to inform the persons present at the hearing of the penalties to which they would be liable for dissemination of information obtained that way. We are in the possession of a document made publicly available by C. in breach of the law; he also does so on the internet site of his grouping, which has the surprising name – in the context – of “Honesty”. Our requests for a discussion about all court cases in which M.C. is involved were rejected by the main party concerned.”', '8.  The article was accompanied by excerpts from a statement of the Tarnów Municipal Council of 11 September 2002 which was signed by 34 councillors. It read as follows:\\n“It is in the public good of the inhabitants of the city of Tarnów that they learn about the arrogance and dishonesty of the local councillor, Mr M.C. A person who does not respect the dignity of a fellow human being is not worthy of holding such a prestigious position as councillor.\\nThe Tarnów Municipal Council strongly disapproves of the behaviour of councillor M.C. who constantly offends other councillors, lowers their dignity and thus grossly violates moral norms and the obligations of a councillor.”', '9.  On an unspecified date in 2004 councillor M.C. lodged with the Tarnów District Court a private bill of indictment against the applicants, charging them with defamation under Article 212 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. He referred to TEMI’s issue of 28 January 2004 in which the first part of the article “Marek C. in episodes” with the statement “we will find out next week whether he may be referred to as an offender” was published. He also referred to the issue of 4 February 2004 in which the second part of the article was published and included the statements “recently C. again lost a court case; this time against a journalist of the local Radio Maks, M.K (...) that was obviously not the first proved case of C.’s breaking the law. It is just worth recalling that in 2001 the State Electoral College rejected his financial report from the presidential campaign. (...) The apex of the offending activities of Marek C. was the recent disclosure of confidential information from court proceedings instituted by Radio Maks against C.” M.C. alleged that the applicants had insinuated that he was an offender. These statements had lowered him in the eyes of the public and undermined the public confidence necessary for the discharge of his duties as a councillor and vice-chairman of the Tarnów Municipal Council.', '10.  In the proceedings before the trial court the first applicant stated that as a journalist she was entitled to write a critical article about M.C. and that the charge against her was groundless since she had put a question mark on the statement concerning the offending activities of the councillor. She and the second applicant had had information from the radio journalist M.K. about the criminal proceedings against M.C. which had been conditionally discontinued. The first applicant further stated that the article was reliable since the spokesperson for the prosecution service had stated that disclosure by a private prosecutor of information originating from a hearing held in private constituted an offence.', '11.  The editor-in-chief (the second applicant) corroborated at the trial the statements of the first applicant. He stated that the impugned article was not the first material about MC. indicating that his behaviour had been bordering on an offence. M.C. had been a defendant in many court cases and had participated in the eviction of two pregnant women. The second applicant emphasised that the impugned article had not contained the term “offender” but “offending activity”.', '12.  On 24 June 2005 the Tarnów District Court gave judgment. It convicted the applicants of defamation committed through the mass media under Article 212 § 2 of the Criminal Code. It held that on account of the publication in the issue of 4 February 2004 of the article “Marek C. in episodes (2)” the applicants had alleged that M.C. had broken the law and that his actions had been of an offending nature. The applicants were each sentenced to a fine of PLN 500 (aprox. EUR 125).', '13.  The District Court found as follows:\\n“Having regard to the established facts it is reasonable to assume that the acts of the accused Dorota Jucha and Tomasz Żak matched the features of the offence of defamation in its aggravated form specified in Article 212 § 2 of the Criminal Code.\\nIn the light of the wording of Article 212 it is generally prohibited to speak badly about another person without a legitimate interest, and the allegation levelled is an imputation when it concerns the behaviour of the defamed person or his characteristics and amounts to imputing to such a person the commission of an offence or failure to fulfil his duties.\\nThe entire significance of the article entitled “Marek C. in episodes (2)” published on 4 February 2004, which may be summarised by reference to its subtitle “Councillor – offender?” came down to quoting a sequence of events which were to present the private prosecutor as an offender (przestępca). Speaking of somebody as an offender has a clearly pejorative meaning for public opinion; it may even be said to be “utterly disgraceful”. The fact that the allegation was not categorical, and that in the present case the subtitle Councillor – offender was followed by a question mark, is not relevant so far as concerns the features of the offence of defamation (as submitted in particular by Dorota Jucha). (...)\\nThe information disseminated by the accused Dorota Jucha and Tomasz Żak was objectively capable of lowering the private prosecutor in the eyes of public opinion and undermining public confidence in his capacity for a given position, occupation or type of activity.\\nAlthough an imputation does not have to be based on a concrete fact and may take the form of a generalised assessment of another person, the article “Marek C. in episodes (2)” included information which was intended to give the impression that the private prosecutor’s activity could be considered offending. The statements included in the article were either untrue (which is relevant to the question whether the accused can rely on the defence of justified criticism) or even if completely true they were distorted in such a way that we may not speak of fair reporting, and thus the “rightness” of the accused’s behaviour.\\nAssessing the particular fragments of the publication it should first be stated that the State Electoral College’s rejection of a financial report from the presidential campaign in which M.C. had actively participated was meant to be evidence of the [private] prosecutor’s offending activity (przestępcza działalność). The following words were put under the subtitle Councillor – offender: “that was obviously not the first proved case of C.’s breaking the law. It is just worth recalling that in 2001 the State Electoral College rejected his financial report from the presidential campaign. The Warsaw Regional Court ordered the forfeiture of some donations paid to C.’s electoral committee. The apex of the offending activities of Marek C. (apogeum przestępczych poczynań Marka C.)...”. In this context the implication of the article is that M.C. committed the offence of breaking the provisions of the electoral law. This allegation is not true.\\nIn the light of the quoted judgment [of the Supreme Court] M.C. is not an offender because he was not convicted under the said law [Law of 27 September 1990 on Elections of the President of the Republic of Poland], it was not “his” financial report but the report of his electoral committee that had been rejected, which is a sanction of an administrative and not of a penal nature, and the forfeiture of some donations has nothing to do with forfeiture as a penal measure under the Criminal Code and is a civil-law consequence of the breach of the electoral law. Thus, to say that those activities have the features of an offence departs from the truth.\\nIn speaking of the apex of the offending activities of Marek C. the accused were imputing to him an offence under Article 241 of the Criminal Code [unauthorised disclosure] having no grounds to do so, since at that time no proceedings which could give rise to a reasonable suspicion [that M.C. had] committed [that] offence were pending. Although it was objectively true that the private prosecutor had written a letter to the president of Radio Maks in which he referred to the circumstances regarding the pending criminal proceedings conducted in private, the statement that that act was an offence constituted an imputation within the meaning of Article 212 of the Criminal Code. (...) It is a court which decides whether the law was broken, and whether an offence was committed. The accused when formulating [their] categorical statement invoked in its support a declaration by B.O., spokesperson for the Tarnów prosecution service, who set out the legal characteristics of the offence specified in Article 241. The information conveyed [by the accused] with reference to the [private] prosecutor’s behaviour which was said to constitute “the apex of the offending activities”, while relying on the unquestionable authority of the prosecution service, distorted the conditional and merely informative nature of the spokesperson’s declaration, [thus] giving the impression that the [private] prosecutor had committed that offence.\\nAs regards the statement contained in the article “recently C. again lost a court case”, which referred to the judgment in which the District Court conditionally discontinued proceedings against Marek C. in respect of one of the charges, it should be noted that the offence [of defamation] may either take the form of making untrue allegations or distorting true circumstances. Although there is no doubt that at a certain stage of the proceedings such a judgment was indeed given (it was not yet final then), the form in which that information was presented immediately after the subtitle “Councillor – offender?” distorts the nature of the conditional discontinuation of the proceedings. A judgment conditionally discontinuing the proceedings is not a conviction. Even accepting the truthfulness of this allegation, the actions of the accused Dorota Jucha and Tomasz Żak could have corresponded to the features of adefence specified in Article 213 § 2 of the Criminal Code only in so far as the making of that allegation could have been justified from the point of view of the right to criticism. The criteria which should be met by such criticism were indicated in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 28 September 2000 (...). [The criticism] should be socially justified and desirable, be made in the public interest and be fair and accurate. However, fairness and accuracy were missing from the information presented by the accused in their article, although as journalists they were under the duty referred to in section 12 § 1(1) of the Press Act to act with particular diligence. This is shown by the lack of objectivity in the information presented, partiality, inaccuracy, the creation of a particular psychological atmosphere surrounding the publication or at least the incomplete presentation of the circumstances of the case resulting from failure to state that the impugned judgment was not final, [and] that the conditional discontinuation concerned one of the charges, while in respect of other [charges] the private prosecutor was acquitted.”', '14.  The applicants appealed, arguing that they had acted in the public interest when publishing the article about the local councillor. They emphasised that the term “offending activities” had been used in the broader sense of “breaking the law” and not in the legal meaning of the word “offending”. They were aware of the provocative nature of the statement “Councillor – offender” but had weakened it by placing a question mark after it. They had exercised their journalistic freedom, which allowed them to have recourse to some degree of exaggeration. Further, they submitted that the District Court had admitted some of the evidence but failed to take other evidence into account, namely articles from the German press concerning M.C.’s travelling abroad with his daughter without the mother’s consent and the District Court’s judgment in case no. II K 807/03 convicting the applicant of defamation in respect of the Tarnów cable television and its journalists.', '15.  On 7 October 2005 the Tarnów Regional Court upheld the first‑instance judgment. The applicants were ordered to reimburse the costs of the appeal proceedings in the amount of PLN 50.', '16.  The Regional Court considered in turn the allegations made about the private prosecutor by the accused. As regards the court case brought by a local radio journalist against M.C., the Regional Court noted that by a judgment of the Tarnów District Court of 15 January 2004 M.C. had been found guilty of defamation and that the court had conditionally discontinued the proceedings. However, the applicants had failed to state that the judgment was not final. On appeal M.C. had been acquitted of defamation.', '17.  As regards the rejection of the financial report, the Regional Court observed that the decision of the Warsaw Regional Court on forfeiture of some electoral donations had not established the personal responsibility of M.C. in this respect or that an issue of his criminal responsibility had arisen.', '18.  Subsequently, the Regional Court assessed the statement about “the apex of the offending activities of Marek C.” which had been made in the context of unauthorised disclosure of information from the defamation proceedings brought by a journalist of Radio Maks against M.C. The information at issue was a statement made by the chairman of Radio Maks (K.Ł.) during a hearing held in private. The Regional Court found that the statement of the chairman concerned only M.C.’s involvement with that radio and as such had been of marginal importance. However, the applicants had presented it as the apex of M.C.’s offending activities.', '19.  The Regional Court found, in so far as relevant:\\n“That offending activity amounts then to one not final judgment finding the private prosecutor guilty in respect of one charge in case no. II K 374/03, the rejection of C.’s financial report from the presidential campaign and, in effect, the fact that C. had quoted a certain statement made by witness K.Ł. at the hearing in case no. II K 374/03.\\nIn the Regional Court’s view the [alleged] offending activity of the private prosecutor in this case was not really presented. Counsel has referred in his appeal to articles from the German press, which indeed depict the [private] prosecutor in an exceptionally negative light. However, it should be noted that this case was not at all mentioned in any of the articles published at that time about the private prosecutor.\\nCounsel subsequently evoked the final judgment of the Tarnów District Court in case no. II K 807/03 where the private prosecutor, appearing as a defendant, was eventually found guilty of having committed an offence under Article 212 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. However, it should be remembered that this judgment was given only in May 2004, and became final on 19 November 2004. Thus, at most the defendants were entitled to mention in their article the fact that another set of criminal proceedings against the private prosecutor was pending, but that is not what they did. However, constructing on that basis a thesis that the defendant [M.C.] carries out offending activities would clearly be at least premature. (...)\\nThe assertion of the defendants that first the statement “offending activities” is much milder than the statement “offence” because it implies a certain supposition, and that moreover that term is supposed to have not only a legal but also a common meaning (as it concerns lawbreaking not necessarily established in a judgment of the criminal court) is a false thesis. Such a statement explicitly indicates that the [private] prosecutor committed offences, and that he had been found guilty of them by a final court decision or even final court decisions, if in effect the accused used the phrase “the apex of the offending activities”. However at that time ... the private prosecutor had not been found guilty of any offence (obviously by a final judgment). The statement that the [private] prosecutor again lost in court against M.K. already indicates that earlier (even leaving aside the fact that the judgment was not final) he had lost some criminal cases. The subtitle “Councillor – offender?” used by the accused in the articles should be recalled in this respect. The question mark, which was supposed to diminish the significance of that statement ... in the context of subsequent information concerning the [private] prosecutor, was in fact merely a technique of social engineering suggesting that the accused was only putting the question whether C. was an offender without prejudging the above. However, statements which they used in the subsequent part of the article had the de facto effect that they instantly provided answers in this respect. Moreover for the offence of defamation a categorical form [of statement] about some dishonourable fact is not necessary. ...\\nThere is no doubt that the accused in the present case did not display accuracy in gathering material concerning the private prosecutor (at least in respect of the impugned article). The information could have been verified as true or false. By employing the term “offending activities” the accused resorted to abuse and untruth. Journalistic freedom includes the possibility of resorting to exaggeration, or even provocation. The right to free expression is one of the basic human rights. It is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 10) and the Constitution of the Republic of Poland (Article 54). The freedom of the press is a main aspect of that right. It is one element of an effective democracy (public scrutiny). However, the right to criticism and free expression may not be transformed into imputations against anyone, including a politician. ...\\nThe limits of criticism as regards politicians and their actions are definitely wider than in respect of other persons. However criticism is not unlimited. It is one thing to consider inappropriate public or private behaviour of the [private] prosecutor, but in the case where de facto a conclusion is formed that the [private] prosecutor is in reality a person having problems with the law, an offender with a significant record of criminal cases (the court returns once more to the expression “the apex of the offending activities”), we cannot speak of acceptable criticism assessing that term in the context of freedom of expression. ... The right to criticism as regards persons holding public functions cannot be exercised in such a manner as to infringe the good name or reputation of the criticised person (judgment of the Supreme Court of 28 March 2003, IV CKN 1901/00)...”.', '20.

The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Garešnica, Croatia.', '6.  On 8 February 1996, at around 6.55 p.m., a bank robbery was committed in Garešnica. The bank robber was disguised, wearing an improvised mask made of a winter cap and a winter scarf, a skirt over his trousers, an overcoat, and rubber gloves on his hands. Using a handgun the bank robber forced the bank employees to put money in a crate, after which he fled the scene.', '7.  Police Station no. 4 of the Bjelovarsko-bilogorska Police Department in Garešnica (Policijska uprava Bjelovarsko-bilogorska, IV Policijska postaja Garešnica – “the police”) was immediately informed of the incident. Police officers were sent to secure the scene and at 8.10 p.m. an in situ inspection was carried out. No evidence was found inside the bank, but there were a number of footprints in the snow outside the bank.', '8.  On the same day a number of persons, including the applicant, were brought in for questioning by the police. The applicant was released from the police station after denying any involvement in the crime.', '9.  In the meantime, in the basement of a residential building in Garešnica the police found clothes which they suspected had been worn and then discarded by the bank robber.', '10.  On 9 February 1996, at 12.50 p.m., the police carried out an on-site inspection of the basement, where they found and seized a stack of money, an improvised mask made from a blue winter cap, a green winter scarf, a crate with 500 Croatian kunas inside it, a pair of green rubber gloves, a blue overcoat and a purple skirt. A police dog was used in the inspection of the scene.', '11.  On the same day the applicant was again taken to the police station for questioning. In the course of the applicant’s stay at the police station the police dog was shown the applicant and, according to the police report, the dog’s behaviour associated the applicant with the objects found in the basement.', '12.  At 4.00 p.m. the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed the bank robbery.', '13.  The applicant was asked to take off his trousers and t-shirt. He complied with the request and signed a seizure record. The seizure record only indicates that the trousers and t-shirt were taken from the applicant. The police also took samples from the applicant’s hair, body hair and nails. There is no specific record in this regard.', '14.  According to the applicant, he was then removed from the room while the police officers packed up the clothes and the samples taken from him. According to the Government, the clothes and the samples were packed by a forensic technician in the presence of a police officer and the applicant, and the police officer simultaneously drafted the seizure record in respect of the applicant’s clothes, which the applicant then signed.', '15.  In course of the further investigation the police interviewed a number of persons and searched the applicant’s flat. No objects connected with the bank robbery were found.', '16.  On 10 February 1996 employees of the bank identified items found and seized in the basement of the residential building (see paragraphs 9 and 10) as the clothes worn by the bank robber.', '17.  On the same day the police sent the items from the basement, together with the applicant’s clothes and samples of his hair and nails, to the Ministry of the Interior’s Centre for Forensic Analysis in Zagreb (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova, Centar za kriminalistička vještačenja – “the Forensic Centre”) and commissioned a forensic report. In their request the police indicated that the samples had been taken and packed using gloves and that a new pair of gloves had been used each time a different item had been packed.', '18.  A preliminary forensic report was drawn up by the Forensic Centre on the same day. The Forensic Centre found strands of the applicant’s hair on the blue overcoat and winter cap worn by the bank robber. It also found fibres from the skirt worn by the bank robber on the applicant’s t-shirt and fibres from the winter scarf on his trousers.', '19.  On 11 February 1996 the applicant was brought before the investigating judge of the Bjelovar County Court (Županijski sud u Bjelovaru) for questioning, but he decided to remain silent because his defence lawyer was not present. On the same day the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention.', '20.  The investigating judge questioned the applicant again on 12 February 1996 in the presence of his defence lawyer, but the applicant remained silent.', '21.  On 14 February 1996 the police forwarded to the investigating judge two forensic reports drawn up on 11 and 13 February 1996 by the Forensic Centre.', '22.  According to the Forensic Centre’s report of 11 February 1996 strands of the applicant’s hair had been found on the winter cap, the scarf and the overcoat worn by the bank robber; the report of 13 February 1996 indicated that fibres from the applicant’s t-shirt and trousers had been found on the crate, the skirt and the overcoat used by the bank robber. The latter report also indicated that fibres from the overcoat, the skirt and the scarf had been found on the applicant’s trousers and t-shirt.', '23.  On 14 February 1996 the Bjelovar County State Attorney’s Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Bjelovaru) asked the investigating judge at the Bjelovar County Court to open an investigation in respect of the applicant on suspicion that he had committed the bank robbery.', '24.  The investigating judge opened the investigation on the same day. During the investigation, the investigating judge questioned bank employees Z.S., M.Kol. and M.Kom., and a witness, M.S. The bank employees Z.S. and M.Kol. testified that they had seen the applicant before and that his physical appearance resembled that of the bank robber.', '25.  On 4 March 1996 the applicant gave his oral evidence. He denied that he had committed the bank robbery and complained that he had been ill-treated at the police station and pressured to confess to the charges. The police had also shown him a blue winter cap and a green scarf and asked him to confirm that they belonged to him. As to the manner in which the police had taken and packed the samples of his hair, nails and clothes, the applicant stated:\\n“When I was taken to the police station for the second time for questioning, the police took my trousers and shirt and [samples of] my hair for forensic analysis. I pulled out a couple of locks of hair myself. I was not present while they packed my clothes and hair for analysis.\\nThey also cut my nails and pulled some hair from my arm and sent them for analysis.\\n...\\n... The items that were taken from me, namely the clothes and the samples of hair, were taken in a separate room, not the room were I was held waiting for questioning. ... Every sample was taken in another room and the sample which I gave in each room remained in that room. I don’t know where my clothes and the samples of my hair were then taken.”', '26.  On 5 March 1996 the Bjelovar County State Attorney’s Office indicted the applicant in the Bjelovar County Court on charges of armed robbery.', '27.  At a hearing on 3 April 1996 the applicant denied all the charges against him. He reiterated his allegations of ill-treatment by the police and complained that the manner in which the samples had been taken and packed for the forensic analysis had allowed for the possibility of tampering with the evidence. The applicant also explained that the samples of his hair had been first taken in one room by police officer T.L. and another police officer whose name he did not know, and then again in another room by police officers T.H., Z.N. and M.', '28.  At the same hearing the bank employees Z.S., M.Kol. and M.Kom. gave their oral evidence.', '29.  Z.S. testified that she knew the applicant and that the applicant’s voice was not similar to that of the bank robber. M.Kol. testified that she had seen the skin on a small part of the bank robber’s face and that it had been skin of a younger person; in any event younger and different from the applicant’s facial skin, although the part of the face which she had seen through the mask could have been the applicant’s. She also stated that she had seen some of the bank robber’s hair, which had been similar to the applicant’s. The witness M.Kom. testified that the applicant’s physical appearance was similar to the bank robber’s.', '30.  The applicant contended before the trial court that the records of the on-site inspection and the taking of the samples were not complete in that not all the actions had been documented. He therefore requested that the police be ordered to provide the names of all the forensic technicians involved and that they be summoned as witnesses. The applicant also requested that the forensic experts who had drafted the forensic reports be called to give evidence about the possibility of contamination between one seized item and another. Furthermore, he asked the trial court to order a reconstruction of the events so that an identification could be made in the setting in which the event had taken place, and that his alibi be verified. Finally, the applicant asked that the rubber gloves used by the bank robber be inspected at the hearing.', '31.  The trial court refused the applicant’s requests regarding the taking of evidence as irrelevant, and concluded the hearing.', '32.  On the same day the Bjelovar County Court found the applicant guilty of the bank robbery and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment, imposing a confiscation order on him in the amounts of 8,410 Croatian kunas, 1,000 Austrian schillings, 3,490 German marks, 100 Australian dollars, 100,000 Italian liras, 12 Canadian dollars, and 20 Swedish kronas. The relevant part of the judgment reads:\\n“The accused stated that ... on the critical occasion he had ... arrived at the Nazaret bar in Garešnica at 9.30 p.m., and there he had heard that a bank in Garešnica had been robbed that same night. Soon afterwards the police had arrived and asked him to come with them. He had been kept in a police station that whole night and had been released at 5 a.m. the next morning. At about 2 p.m. the next day he had again been asked to come to the police station, and the police officers had asked him to confess that he had robbed the bank. He had been ill-treated, they had beaten him, but he could not confess to something he had not done. His clothes had then been taken from him, as well as samples of his hair, but he had not been present when the samples had been taken from the clothes and when they had been packed and sent for analysis. He argued that the fibres [from his clothes] had been transferred to the other clothes by the items being rubbed against each other ... so the evidence thus obtained had been planted by the police.\\n...\\nThe request by the defence to obtain from the Garešnica Police Station the names of the officers who carried out the on-site inspection and took the samples, and for them to be heard as witnesses ... was refused because the case file contains written records on the on-site inspection and written reports on all steps carried out at the preliminary stage of these proceedings, so that there is no need to hear the officers who carried out those acts.\\nThe request by the defence for forensic experts D.K. and J.K. to be heard concerning the possibility that there was a transmission of fibres from one item to another was also refused because it is well known that such traces can be transmitted through various means such as by rubbing etc., so it was not necessary to hear expert witnesses on this. The court also took into account the fact that there had been no objection to the forensic reports.\\n...\\nWitnesses Z.S., M.Kol. and M. Kom., the bank employees, gave identical descriptions of the conduct of the disguised person who had entered the bank at the relevant time, shortly before 7.00 p.m., and [they gave identical descriptions of] the clothes he had been wearing. They stated that the person at issue had been disguised, wearing an improvised mask made from a cap. Around his neck he had had a winter scarf, and he had been wearing a dark women’s overcoat. Underneath the overcoat he had been wearing a purple skirt and trousers. This person had pointed a gun and started shouting that this was a bank robbery; he had demanded money and threatened to kill [the bank employees]. He had then put a crate on the counter and asked for the money. M.Kol. had given him the money, putting it in the crate, after which the disguised person had left the bank. The said witnesses also testified that the person in question resembled the accused in his physical appearance, but that they had not recognised him as the accused, although the accused was known to them. Moreover, the witness M.Kol. testified that she had momentarily seen a part of the disguised person’s face but she thought that that person was younger than the accused.\\n...\\nIn view of the evidence given by the witnesses as to what the disguised bank robber had been wearing when he entered the bank, and the Forensic Centre’s report concerning the fibres and strands of hair found on the items and clothes seized from the accused, there is no doubt that the accused is the disguised person who entered the bank at the time of the events, and that he was disguised in the clothes which were found during the on-site investigation in a nearby residential building.\\n...\\nThis court cannot accept the applicant’s argument that this evidence was planted by the police, because the relevant laws prescribe in detail the procedure in such situations as regards the taking of samples, packing them and sending them for forensic analysis, and there are written records on all the steps taken, so that any doubt as to whether, intentionally or unintentionally, fabric fibres or hairs were transferred from one set of clothes to another is excluded, and this court considers that there is no reason to question the authenticity of this evidence.\\n...”', '33.  On 3 May 1996 the applicant lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), reiterating his previous arguments regarding the evidence in issue. He contended that although when the samples of his hair and clothes were packed for the analysis he was detained at the police station, the police had not allowed him to be present during the packing of the samples and therefore the relevant evidence could have been planted and otherwise tampered with.', '34.  On 7 January 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the findings of the first-instance court.', '35.  On 9 February 1998 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), reiterating his previous arguments about the manner in which the evidence had been gathered by the trial court. In his constitutional complaint the applicant gave his address in Garešnica but stated that he was detained in Bjelovar Prison (Zatvor u Bjelovaru).', '36.  On 11 February 1998 the applicant began a five-year prison sentence to which he had been sentenced in another set of criminal proceedings. He was transferred from Bjelovar Prison to Zagreb Prison (Zatvor u Zagrebu). He was detained in Zagreb Prison until 6 March 1998, when he was transferred to Lepoglava State Prison (Kaznionica u Lepoglavi).', '37.  On 9 March 1998 the applicant lodged a request for the extraordinary mitigation of his sentence (zahtjev za izvanredno ublažavanje kazne) and a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment (zahtjev za izvanredno preispitivanje pravomoćne presude).', '38.  In course of the Bjelovar County Court’s examination of the circumstances surrounding the applicant’s request for the extraordinary mitigation of his sentence, on 13 March 1998 Lepoglava State Prison informed the Bjelovar County Court that the applicant was detained in that prison.', '39.  On 16 March 1998 the Constitutional Court informed the Bjelovar County Court that the applicant had lodged a constitutional complaint and asked for the case file to be forwarded to it.', '40.  On 19 March 1998 the Bjelovar County Court declared the applicant’s request for extraordinary review of a final judgment inadmissible since it had been lodged against the judgment of the Supreme Court, which was not possible under the relevant domestic law.', '41.  On 2 April 1998 the Bjelovar County Court forwarded the case file to the Supreme Court in connection with the applicant’s request for the extraordinary mitigation of his sentence and recommended that the request be dismissed as ill-founded.', '42.  A copy of the entire case file was also sent to the Constitutional Court on 3 April 1998.', '43.  On 17 June 1998 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts.', '44.  The decision of the Constitutional Court was sent to the applicant’s address in Garešnica on 6 July 1998 but it was returned to the Constitutional Court with a note that it had not been possible to serve it since the applicant was not at that address.', '45.  On 12 August 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s request for the extraordinary mitigation of his sentence as ill-founded.', '46.  On 4 and 17 September 1998 the Constitutional Court again attempted to serve its decision of 17 June 1998 on the applicant at his address in Garešnica. Each time the correspondence was returned, with a note that the applicant was not at that address.', '47.  The Constitutional Court placed the decision on its public notice board on 22 September 1998, where it remained until 30 September 1998.', '48.  On 19 January 1999 the Garešnica Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Garešnici) instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of an order for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. However, on 24 June 1999 the enforcement proceedings were discontinued since it had been impossible to enforce the order on account of the applicant’s lack of any financial means.', '49.  On 26 September 2001 the applicant was released from Lepoglava State Prison on parole.', '50.  Since he had not received any decision from it, on 19 September 2002 the applicant urged the Constitutional Court to decide on his constitutional complaint', '51.  On 20 March 2009 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Constitutional Court to inform him as to the status of the applicant’s constitutional complaint.', '52.

The applicant was born in 1981 and resides in Moscow.', '6.  In September 2009 the applicant arrived in Russia from Uzbekistan and settled in the Moscow Region. Until December 2009 he was officially registered with the Russian migration authorities in Moscow. According to the Government, he subsequently resided without formal registration in the Moscow region. According to the applicant, he always complied with the legal requirement for registration at one’s place of residence.', '7.  In the meantime, on 20 November 2009 the Uzbek authorities charged the applicant in absentia under Articles 159 § 3(b) and 244-2 § 1 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, which punish calls to overthrow the constitutional order of Uzbekistan and involvement in religious, extremist, separatist and other banned organisations (see paragraphs 78-79 below). The applicant was accused of being member of a group called Warriors of Islam which, apparently, had been prohibited in Uzbekistan and had been classified as an extremist religious organisation by the Uzbek authorities. It is stated in the information note sent by the Uzbek authorities to their Russian counterparts that this group was a faction of the Islamic Party of Turkestan (formerly called the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan), which had been banned in Uzbekistan.', '8.  The Uzbek decision listing the charges against the applicant reads as follows:\\n“... [The applicant] was actively engaged in spreading propaganda in the Navoi region. These activities were aimed at securing the confidentiality of information relating to the group’s actions, securing strict compliance with the orders issued by the group’s supporters, ensuring the return [of society] to the roots of Islam and making everyday life based solely on the rules of the Koran. His activities were also aimed at political and armed struggle against those who oppose the [group’s] ideas and [those] who are treated as enemies of Islam. His propaganda activities had the goal of uniting all Muslims and creating the united State of the “Islamic Caliphate” governed by rules of Shariah; [all the] while considering the democratic changes in Uzbekistan [brought about] by means of laws wrong and [illegitimate].\\nIn particular, [the applicant] participated in the activities of “communes” run by his group in the Navoi region. Having joined others in an organised criminal group, he studied printed material produced by the group’s supporters. He was active in spreading propaganda among people having no stable opinion, encouraging them to join the group and promoting the group’s ideas. All these had as their subsequent aim the overthrow of the constitutional order ...\\nAlso, in 2008 together with his accomplices within the group [the applicant] participated in the group’s meetings, [which were] aimed at the armed overthrow of the constitutional order ...”', '9.  On 20 November 2009 the applicant’s name was put on a wanted list.', '10.  By a decision of 23 November 2009 the Navoi Town Court of Uzbekistan ordered the applicant’s detention and that he be held in remand centre no. 7 in the town of Kattakurgan.', '11.  According to the applicant, in November 2009 he called his relatives in Uzbekistan and learnt that he was wanted by the Uzbek authorities on criminal charges.', '12.  In April 2010 the applicant requested that the regional migration authority grant him refugee status. The applicant was given a certificate confirming that his application for refugee status was being processed.', '13.  The applicant submitted to the migration authority that he had left Uzbekistan because of numerous arrests since September 2009 in the village of Talkok, where he had been residing at the time. Several people had been arrested on various charges, for instance in relation to drug trafficking. The applicant also affirmed that: he was not a member of any political or religious organisation; he had not taken part in any opposition movement; and he had not distributed any political or religious literature. Lastly, he stated that he feared returning to Uzbekistan, where he would be placed in detention.', '14.  On 21 May 2010 the applicant was arrested and detained in relation to the criminal proceedings pending against him in Uzbekistan (see paragraph 19 below). It is unclear whether the applicant amended – in any significant manner – his refugee application on account of the circumstances relating to these proceedings and the Uzbek extradition request.', '15.  By a decision of 5 July 2010 the migration authority rejected the refugee application in the following terms:\\n“The applicant has not presented any facts concerning his fear of political or religious persecution. He indicated during the interview that he did not know of any political parties and that he had not been a member of any religious or non-governmental organisations; he had not been the victim of any violent incidents. Having regard to the reasons for his departure from Uzbekistan, it does not appear that he was persecuted on account of his political views or religious beliefs.\\nThe applicant is of the Islamic faith, which is the dominant religion in his country. Nothing prevents him from praying and going to a mosque. He is not involved in any political activity.\\nAlso, regarding the allegation concerning the arrests in September 2009 and that the applicant had been ordered to go to a police station, it does not appear that any repressive measures were taken against him.\\nThe Federal Migration Authority (FMA) has provided the following information concerning the political, social, economic and migration situation in Uzbekistan:\\n80% of the population are Sunni Muslims. The FMA has no facts in its possession regarding persecution on religious or political grounds. Article 31 of the Uzbek Constitution and other laws provide for civic rights and freedoms for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity, religious beliefs or political views. The Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations Act contains clear rules concerning religious organisations, their interaction with the State and fully guarantees the right to manifest one’s religion, alone or in community with others ... Uzbekistan has ratified, without reservations, all six main UN treaties concerning human rights and regularly submits reports to the competent agencies of the United Nations. In total, Uzbekistan has ratified over sixty international treaties relating to human rights. Uzbekistan is not a party to the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees and its Protocol. However, in November 1999 they signed the Charter of European Security, thus undertaking to protect refugees. In 1996 Uzbekistan became a party to the UN Convention against Torture.\\nThere can be various understandable reasons compelling a person to leave the country of his origin, but only one qualifies [that person to fall within] the notion of refugee. The expression “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted” makes all other reasons irrelevant.\\nThe applicant has not adduced convincing grounds for leaving his country of nationality for reasons which would fall within the scope of section 1 § 1(1) of the Refugees Act ...”', '16.  On 8 July 2010 the migration authority dispatched a letter notifying the applicant of the refusal. The letter also indicated that the refusal could be challenged before the FMA or a court and that in the absence of other legal grounds for staying on the territory of Russia the applicant would have to leave it. Apparently, the applicant received this letter but did not apply for judicial review.', '17.  Instead, in October 2010 the applicant requested that the migration authority grant him temporary asylum in Russia (see paragraph 44 below). The migration authority rejected this request on 20 December 2010. The applicant did not challenge this refusal before a court.', '18.  In March 2012 the applicant lodged a new application for temporary asylum. On 5 June 2012 the migration authority granted the applicant temporary asylum in Russia, considering that it was necessary in order to provide a legal basis for his continued presence in Russia and Russia’s compliance with the Court’s indication under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Such temporary asylum should remain in force until delivery of the final judgment by the Court and, in any event, no longer than until 5 June 2013.', '19.  The applicant was arrested in the town of Krasnogorsk in the Moscow Region on 21 May 2010. The actual circumstances leading to the applicant’s arrest remain unclear. The arrest record reads as follows:\\n“Identity document: an information document concerning the search for the religious extremist (passport details); a document concerning a pending application for refugee status ...\\nGrounds and reasons for arrest: [the applicant] is subject to an arrest warrant procedure; a detention order [has been] issued by [an Uzbek] court ...\\n{In pre-printed letters} I have been informed that under Article 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure I am entitled to know the accusation against me, ... to have legal assistance from the moment indicated in Article 49 §§ 2 and 3.1 of the Code, to have meetings in private with counsel before my first questioning ...\\nI have been informed that I am suspected of offences directed against the constitutional order of Uzbekistan and [of the] creation of a criminal community ...”\\nThe record bears the applicant’s signature and a note by him saying that he had read the documents and had no comment on them.', '20.  On the same date, the Russian authorities contacted their Uzbek colleagues, informing them of the applicant’s arrest and seeking confirmation of the Uzbek authorities’ intention to request the extradition of the applicant. That same day, the Uzbek authorities submitted a document requesting the applicant’s detention to the Russian authorities.', '21.  The applicant also signed, apparently on 22 May 2010, another document entitled Notification of rights to the suspect. On the same date, the applicant was interviewed by a deputy town prosecutor and confirmed to him in writing that he had been informed of his rights not to incriminate himself and to have the assistance of an interpreter. He waived the assistance of an interpreter, stating that he could read, speak and understand Russian.', '22.  On 23 May 2010 the Krasnogorsk Town Prosecutor ordered the applicant’s detention, doing so with reference to the Uzbek detention order of 23 November 2009 and Article 61 of the 1993 Minsk Convention (see paragraph 75 below).', '23.  According to the applicant, after his arrest his procedural rights were not explained to him and he was unable to have the assistance of a lawyer until some time later. In the applicant’s submission, on 10 June 2010 the staff of the detention facility where he was being kept refused to allow lawyer L. to visit him, stating that he had no formal authorisation for that visit from the Krasnogorsk Prosecutor’s Office.', '24.  On 28 June 2010 the Prosecutor General’s Office received a formal extradition request from the Uzbek authorities, which contained the following statement:\\n“We guarantee that, as required under Articles 16, 17 and 24 of the Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure, [the applicant] will not be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the extradition request is not aimed at persecuting him for political reasons, [or] on grounds relating to race, religious beliefs or nationality. In compliance with Article 66 of the [Minsk] Convention he will not be surrendered to another country without Russia’s consent ... Since 1 January 1998 the death penalty has been abolished in Uzbekistan ...”', '25.  On 29 June 2010 the Krasnogorsk Town Prosecutor considered the applicant’s detention again and ordered, without specifying the duration, the applicant’s detention under Article 466 § 2 of the CCrP (see paragraph 56 below).', '26.  On 20 July 2010 the town prosecutor applied to the Krasnogorsk Town Court, seeking authorisation of the applicant’s continued detention. By a decision of 21 July 2010 the Town Court confirmed the lawfulness of the prosecutor’s previous decisions ordering the applicant’s detention. Referring to Articles 109 and 466 § 1 of the CCrP, the court extended the applicant’s detention “until 21 August 2010 to amount in total to three months” (apparently, counting from the date of the applicant’s arrest). Lawyer B. was present at the detention hearing and acted as counsel for the applicant.', '27.  Before the expiry of the previous detention order, on 13 August 2010 the acting town prosecutor sought an extension of the applicant’s detention because the extradition proceedings were still pending. On 27 August 2010 the Town Court extended the applicant’s detention until 21 November 2010. Lawyer P. was present at the detention hearing and acted as counsel for the applicant.', '28.  Before the expiry of the previous detention order, the regional prosecutor sought an extension of the applicant’s detention. On 18 November 2010 the Town Court extended the applicant’s detention until 21 February 2011, to amount in total to nine months. Lawyer S. was present at the detention hearing and acted as counsel for the applicant.', '29.  On 18 February 2011 the Town Court examined an extension request from the regional prosecutor and extended the applicant’s detention until 21 May 2011, to amount in total to twelve months. Lawyer M. was present at the detention hearing and acted as counsel for the applicant.', '30.  Apparently, no request for participation in the above court hearings concerning the applicant’s detention had been submitted by lawyer L. The transcripts of the above hearings do not contain any request from the applicant to appoint L. or to dismiss the appointed lawyers for any reason.', '31.  On an unspecified date, lawyer L. started to represent the applicant in the extradition proceedings.', '32.  On 16 May 2011 the Moscow Regional Court examined submissions from L. and extended the applicant’s detention until 21 November 2011, concluding that, if at large, the applicant would flee justice. The court also noted that the Court had made an indication under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, thus (temporarily) preventing enforcement of the extradition order which had become final on 17 March 2011. The applicant appealed. On 7 July 2011 the Appeal Section of the Regional Court upheld the detention order. Apparently, the applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal.', '33.  On 21 November 2011 the acting town prosecutor ordered the applicant’s release from custody due to the expiry of the maximum eighteen-month statutory period of detention. The applicant was released on the same day.', '34.  In the meantime, on 5 October 2010 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office issued an extradition order in respect of the applicant. The order indicated that there were no obstacles to extraditing the applicant under Russian law and the international treaties binding Russia.', '35.  According to the applicant, the Krasnogorsk Prosecutor’s Office did not allow his lawyer L. access to the extradition file until 12 October 2010, and, even after the lawyer was granted access to the materials in question, he was unable to obtain a copy of the extradition order. It appears that the applicant complained of these matters to higher prosecutor’s offices on several occasions.', '36.  In a letter of 26 November 2010 the Moscow Region Prosecutor’s Office replied to the applicant’s lawyer, stating that his complaints against the detention centre and the Krasnogorsk Prosecutor’s Office had been examined and resolved. In particular, he had been authorised to meet with the applicant and obtain access to the materials concerning the extradition proceedings. The letter also stated that the applicant’s lawyer could receive the extradition order of 5 October 2010 from the applicant, or make a copy at his own expense from the extradition file.', '37.  In a letter of 30 November 2010 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office informed the applicant’s lawyer that his complaints against the Krasnogorsk Prosecutor’s Office and the detention centre were being examined. The extradition order of 5 October 2010 was enclosed with this letter.', '38.  The applicant challenged the extradition order before the Moscow Regional Court, stating that he had not been involved in the offences imputed to him, and, at the time of his departure from Uzbekistan, his name had not been on a wanted list.', '39.  On 25 January 2011 the Regional Court held a hearing and heard submissions from the applicant and his lawyer, L. The Regional Court confirmed the extradition order in the following terms:\\n“The Uzbek extradition request is in compliance with the European Convention on Extradition and Article 58 of the Minsk Convention ... The case file contains assurances from the requesting State that the extradition request does not aim at persecuting [the applicant] for political reasons, [or] on grounds relating to race, religion or nationality. The Uzbek authorities have given guarantees that in the event of his extradition [the applicant] would not be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; he would be prosecuted only for the offences mentioned in the extradition request ... The migration authority has dismissed [the applicant’s] application for refugee status ... He has not sought judicial review of this refusal ... He has not sought judicial review of the refusal of temporary asylum ...\\nThe allegation concerning human-rights violations in Uzbekistan has been examined by this court. The general and political situation in that country has also been taken into consideration ... However, the [applicant’s] allegation in itself is not a reason for granting his challenge to the extradition order ...\\nThe extradition request contains a statement that [the applicant] was/is not being persecuted for political reasons or on grounds relating to race, religion or nationality and that he would not be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\n[The applicant] and his lawyer have not adduced any objective reasons which would allow [this court] to doubt the assurances made by the Uzbek authorities ... When examining [the applicant’s] applications for refugee status and temporary asylum, the authorities established he had not adduced any well-founded reasons [to the effect] that he had left his country for reasons relating to fears of being persecuted on account of his race, religious beliefs, nationality or his belonging to a specific social group or due to his political views ...”', '40.  On 17 March 2011 the Supreme Court of Russia rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 25 January 2011, largely relying on the reasoning of the first-instance court.'], 'applicants': ['UMIROV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['18', '68', '8'], '6': ['122']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 13], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 13], 'explained_indices': [2, 0, 3, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 20, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 27, 19, 17, 34, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 10, 35, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.13445592, 0.032145202, 0.022997856, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, 0.004810095, -0.0004529357], 'number_of_sentences': 36, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants were born in 1986 and 1979 respectively and live in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode (a district of the Brussels-Capital region).', '10.  The applicants are brothers who live with their parents, their brother and two sisters next to the local police station of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. They both complained that they had been slapped in the face by police officers – which allegation is disputed by the Government – one on 8 December 2003 and the other on 23 February 2004. They submitted that those events had taken place against a background of tense relations between their family and certain officers in the police station.', '11.  The applicants submitted that on 8 December 2003, at around 4 p.m., the first applicant had been standing with a friend in the street outside the door of the building where he lived with his family and, since he had forgotten his keys, had been ringing the bell so that his parents would let him in, when a plain-clothes policeman, A.Z., had asked him to show him his identity card. The first applicant had refused to comply, asking the officer to show him his credentials. The officer had then grabbed him by his jacket – tearing it – and taken him to the police station. The first applicant had been placed in a room and, while he was alone with A.Z., the officer had slapped him in the face as he was protesting about his arrest.', '12.  The applicants provided a certificate issued at 7.20 p.m. on the same day by a general practitioner attesting that the first applicant had been “in a state of shock” and had presented the following injuries: “erythema on the left cheek (disappearing)” and “erythema on the left-side external auditory canal”.', '13.  The Government submitted that, on account of the first applicant’s refusal to show him his identity card, Officer A.Z. had had no choice but to take him to the police station for identification. The first applicant had then caused a scene, claiming to have suffered an injustice and been subjected to an unlawful identity check, and had insulted an officer who was telling him to calm down. He had been allowed to leave the police station once his identity had been verified and after being informed by A.Z. that a police report would be filed against him for forceful resistance to a public officer, abusive behaviour and verbal threats. He had returned to the police station a few minutes later with his parents, accusing A.Z. of having struck him, but the officer had always denied this.', '14.  At 6 p.m. A.Z. had lodged a criminal complaint against the first applicant, alleging forceful resistance to a public officer, abusive behaviour and verbal threats. The record drawn up on that occasion showed that A.Z. had notified his superiors of the events at 5.30 p.m., as well as a certain Superintendent K.', '15.  The applicants indicated that on 23 February 2004, between 9.44 a.m. and 10.20 a.m. (as shown by the record of the second applicant’s questioning), while the second applicant was at the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police station and Officer P.P. was interviewing him about an altercation involving him and his mother together with a third party (and about which the latter had filed a complaint), P.P. had slapped him in the face after asking him not to lean on his desk. He had then forced him to sign his statement by threatening to put him in a cell.', '16.  The applicants provided a medical certificate issued on the same day by a general practitioner, who observed “bruising [on the] left cheek” of the second applicant. The certificate did not specify the time at which it had been drawn up, although it must have been before 11.20 a.m., the time at which it was presented to the Standing Committee for the oversight of police services (known as “Committee P” – see paragraph 25 below).', '17.  The Government explained that the second applicant had been very arrogant during his interview: slouching in his chair, leaning casually on P.P.’s desk, laughing without any reason and giving pithy answers to questions. He had also had his statement changed several times, saying that the police were paid to do that, and had threatened the officers on leaving by shouting that they would be hearing from him again. The Government emphasised that, in spite of the attitude shown by the second applicant, who had clearly been intent on conflict, P.P. had remained calm and patient.', '18.  In the applicants’ submission, their family had been harassed by the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force. They stated that the problems had begun in 1999, when one of the officers had suspected N. of deliberately scratching his car. N. had subsequently been charged with threatening the same officer and committing robberies, on which charges he had been acquitted by the Brussels Youth Court on 21 April 2000. According to the applicants, the case against him had been entirely fabricated by members of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force by way of reprisal.', '19.  They added that on 24 June 1999 the first applicant, then aged 13, had been “beaten” by another police officer in the police station, where he had been taken following a fight in the street. He had sustained a perforated eardrum. His mother and one of his sisters, who had been in the waiting room, had been shaken and manhandled by police officers.', '20.  On 25 November 1999 one of their sisters had been verbally abused by an officer of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force, and on 11 March 2000 their brother, N., had been searched, jostled and verbally abused by police officers.', '21.  They further stated that in 2000 a “case ... initiated by the Saint‑Josse-ten-Noode police force had been opened against N. and entrusted to an investigating judge”, but the proceedings had been discontinued. In the same year the second applicant had been “wanted for questioning” and, even though the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force had announced on 23 July 2002 that he was being taken off the relevant “wanted” list, he had still had to make various applications to the prosecutor’s office and wait until March 2005 for the process to be completed, causing him a great deal of inconvenience.', '22.  On 6 April 2001 and 12 July 2001 respectively, N. and the second applicant had been verbally abused by officers of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force.', '23.  The applicants explained that they had systematically reported to the judicial authorities or police all the incidents of which they had been victims, and had filed complaints.', '24.  At 9.42 a.m. on 9 December 2003 the first applicant filed a complaint with Committee P and was interviewed by a member of the investigation department. A copy of the medical certificate drawn up the previous day was appended to the initial record.', '25.  The second applicant followed suit at 11.20 a.m. on 23 February 2004. He indicated in particular that he considered that the “general attitude of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force vis-à-vis [his] family [had become] absolutely intolerable and excessive to the point [where they had envisaged] moving house”. A copy of the medical certificate drawn up the same day was appended to the initial record.', '26.  The applicants’ mother was also interviewed on 23 February 2004 by the investigation department of Committee P in relation to the second applicant’s complaints. She pointed out that as soon as they had returned home she had called Superintendent K. (see paragraph 14 above) to ask him to persuade P.P. to apologise. Superintendent K. had immediately come to their house, where he had found himself in the company of the physician who had drawn up the medical certificate. The applicants’ mother also filed a complaint, indicating, moreover, that she herself had been treated with scant respect by Officer P.P.', '27.  On 5 May 2004 Officer P.P. was interviewed by the director of internal oversight of the local police force in relation to the complaints by the second applicant and his mother. P.P. stated in particular that the second applicant had been particularly disrespectful towards him during his interview and that, although he had grabbed the youth by the arm to make him leave the office, he had not slapped him in the face.', '28.  On 17 June 2004 the applicants applied to intervene as civil parties in respect of charges of harassment, arbitrary interference with fundamental freedoms, abuse of authority, arbitrary arrest and wounding with intent. They gave an overview of all their difficulties with the Saint‑Josse‑ten‑Noode police force, and expressly stated that they wished to intervene as civil parties in relation to the events of 8 December 2003 and 23 February 2004.', '29.  Officers A.Z. and P.P. were charged with using violence against individuals in the course of their duties and, in particular, with intentional wounding or assault, and with engaging in arbitrary acts in breach of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.', '30.  On 26 June 2004 an investigating judge of the Brussels Court of First Instance gave directions to the investigation department of Committee P asking it to take note of the applicants’ civil-party application, to interview them in order to ascertain the details of their complaint, to draft a report on the conduct of the Bouyid family, to draw up a list of the cases brought against them and complaints filed by them, and to explain what action had been taken in that connection.', '31.  Having regard to the fact that it had already taken testimony from the applicants when they had filed their respective complaints (see paragraphs 24-25 above), the investigation department of Committee P decided not to interview them again. On 26 July 2004 it forwarded a report to the investigating judge, based on the documents from the internal oversight department of the police district covering Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, describing developments in the relations between the applicants’ family and the local police force. The report then listed the cases against the family, noting in this connection that the first applicant had been implicated in proceedings opened in December 2003 for abusive and threatening behaviour and for obstructing a police officer, and N. in seven sets of proceedings opened between October 1997 and June 1999. It then noted that, in addition to the applicants’ complaints in issue in the present case, three judicial complaints had been filed by members of their family (two with Committee P, in June 1999 and July 2001, and one with the “Youth Division” in 1999) and two complaints had been dealt with by the internal oversight department of the police district covering Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. Lastly, citing a report drawn up in the context of a case against the first applicant and the findings of administrative inquiries, it noted the problematic nature of the relations between the local police and the Bouyid family and commented on the “general behaviour” of the latter, observing as follows.\\n“In sum, according to the police officers, the Bouyid family (especially the women and the mother in particular) apparently refuse to admit that the children of the family bear any responsibility for the abusive conduct in question. The children are thus supported in their behaviour by this protective attitude. More generally, the family members are said to behave aggressively and provocatively towards the police.\\nFollowing the incidents involving police officer [B.], a dialogue facilitator apparently failed in an attempt at reconciliation, owing to an intransigent attitude on the part of the women in the Bouyid family.\\nIn 1999 and 2000 the situation required the appointment of a police cadet as a mediator for this family.”', '32.  On 3 August 2004 the investigating judge decided to close the investigation and sent the file to the prosecuting authorities.', '33.  On 16 November 2004 Officer A.Z. was interviewed by a member of the investigation department of Committee P about the events of 8 December 2003. He stated in particular that he had not previously known the first applicant when he had taken him to the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police station that particular day.', '34.  In an application of 10 November 2005, the Crown Prosecutor called for the discontinuance of the case on the ground that “the judicial investigation [had] not established that the facts constituted a serious or petty offence and [had] not adduced any evidence that would justify the taking of further measures”.', '35.  The applicants were informed that the case file would be finalised before the Committals Division of the Brussels Court of First Instance on 2 March 2006. On 1 March 2006 they sent an application to the investigating judge seeking twenty additional investigative measures. That request resulted in the adjournment sine die of the case before the Committals Division.', '36.  On 7 March 2006 the investigating judge ordered two of the requested measures and rejected the remainder of the application on the grounds that it concerned facts that predated the events referred to him and that the measures sought were not necessary for establishing the truth. Consequently, recapitulating all their complaints against the Saint‑Josse‑ten‑Noode police force, the applicants and other members of their family sent the investigating judge a request for an “extension of civil-party status”, but it was rejected. The two additional measures were put into effect on 25 April, 15 May and 24 May 2006.', '37.  In an order of 27 November 2007, the Committals Division, endorsing the grounds set out in the Crown Prosecutor’s application, discontinued the proceedings.', '38.  The applicants appealed against that order.', '39.  In an application of 3 December 2007, the Principal Crown Prosecutor requested that the discontinuance order be upheld.', '40.  On 5 February 2008 the applicants and other members of their family filed a complaint as civil parties in respect of all the facts that the investigating judge had considered not to have been referred to him (see paragraphs 43-44 below).', '41.  On 9 April 2008 the Indictments Division of the Brussels Court of Appeal, after refusing to join the case concerning the events of 8 December 2003 and 23 February 2004 to the new case that had been opened after the civil-party complaint of 5 February 2008, upheld the discontinuance order in a judgment that read as follows.\\n“...\\nThe facts of the case can be summarised as follows:\\n–  On 8 December 2003 the defendant [A.Z.] is alleged to have engaged in illegal police conduct against the civil party Saïd Bouyid, described by the latter as follows: police officer [A.Z.], on stopping him outside his house, allegedly grabbed him by his jacket and tore it; he was then taken to the police station close by, where the same officer allegedly slapped him on the face with his right hand.\\n–  On 23 February 2004 the defendant [P.P.] is alleged to have engaged in illegal police conduct against the civil party Mohamed Bouyid, described by the latter as follows: on stopping his car in front of his house so that his mother could take out her shopping, he had a row with the driver of the car behind; he was summoned to the police station following a complaint by that driver; during the interview, Mohamed Bouyid was allegedly slapped by the defendant [P.P.] (see the medical certificate issued by Dr ...), who threatened to put him in a cell if he did not sign his statement, when in fact he wanted to change it.\\n–  The Bouyid family have apparently encountered great difficulties with certain members of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police force since March 1999, when police officer [B.] suspected [N.] Bouyid of having scratched his car, giving rise to a certain degree of tension and to persecution of this family by the police.\\n–  There is said to be constant provocation on the part of the police of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode making the life of the Bouyid family unbearable.\\nBoth the police’s internal oversight department for the police district [concerned] and the investigation department of Committee P conducted an in-depth investigation into the facts complained of by the civil parties.\\nIt transpires from all the findings of the judicial investigation, and in particular from the inconsistent statements of the parties in question, that there is no evidence against the defendants such as to justify their committal on the charges listed in the submissions of the Principal Crown Prosecutor, in respect of the period in which the offences were said to have been committed.\\nThe statements of the defendants, who deny the charges, are consistent; it is appropriate in this connection to refer to the detailed report concerning the general conduct of the civil parties’ family drawn up by Committee P, which sheds light on the general context of the case.\\nThe civil parties have not adduced before the court, sitting as the Indictments Division, any new, relevant and convincing information not previously brought to the attention of the court below and capable of revealing the slightest evidence against the defendants that might justify their committal for trial.\\nMoreover, the judicial investigation did not bring to light sufficient evidence to show that a criminal offence had been committed by the defendants at the time of the incidents in which they were allegedly implicated.\\nIn addition, it does not appear from the case file that the provisions of section 37 of the Law of 5 August 1992 on police duties have not been complied with.\\nAs emphasised by the submissions of both the Crown Prosecutor of 10 November 2005 and those of the Principal Crown Prosecutor, and by the decision of the Committals Division, the facts of the present case do not constitute a serious or petty criminal offence.\\n...”', '42.  An appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants – relying in particular on Articles 3, 6 and 13 of the Convention – was dismissed on 29 October 2008 by the Court of Cassation.', '43.  On 5 February 2008 six members of the Bouyid family, including the two applicants, had filed a civil-party complaint with an investigating judge of the Brussels Court of First Instance concerning all their accusations against the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode police officers, in particular relating to facts that predated the events of 8 December 2003 and 23 February 2004.', '44.  The civil-party complaint led to the appearance of six officers before the Brussels Court of First Instance, hearing the case on the merits. In a judgment of 30 May 2012, the court declared that the prosecution of the relevant offences was time-barred. It does not appear from the file that an appeal was lodged against that judgment.', '45.  The Preamble to the 26 June 1945 Charter of the United Nations affirms the determination of the peoples of the United Nations “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. The concept of dignity is also mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948, the Preamble to which states that “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world”, and Article 1 of which provides that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”.', '46.  Many subsequent international human rights texts and instruments refer to this concept, including:\\n(a)  the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 20 November 1963, which “solemnly affirms the necessity of speedily eliminating racial discrimination throughout the world, in all its forms and manifestations, and of securing understanding of and respect for the dignity of the human person”, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 21 December 1965 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which refers to that Declaration;\\n(b)  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 16 December 1966 (both ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which states that the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family “derive from the inherent dignity of the human person”. Furthermore, Article 10 of the former provides that “all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person”, and Article 13 of the latter states that the “States Parties ... recognize the right of everyone to education ... [and] agree that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ...”;\\n(c)  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 18 December 1979 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which emphasises in particular that discrimination against women “violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity”;\\n(d)  the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 10 December 1984 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which points out that the “equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family ... derive from the inherent dignity of the human person”;\\n(e)  the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which states that “the child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in society, and brought up in the spirit of the ideals proclaimed in the UN Charter, and in particular in the spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity” (see also Articles 23 § 1, 28 § 2, 37, 39 and 40 § 1);\\n(f)  the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (Articles 19 § 2 and 24 § 5 (c)) (ratified by Belgium);\\n(g)  the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which states that “discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person”, and the aims of which include promoting respect for the “inherent dignity” of persons with disabilities (Article 1), this being also one of its general principles (Article 3 (a)) (see also Articles 8 (a), 16 § 4, 24 § 1 and 25);\\n(h)  the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death penalty of 15 December 1989 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which expresses the conviction that “abolition of the death penalty contributes to enhancement of human dignity and progressive development of human rights”;\\n(i)  the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure of 19 December 2011 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which reaffirms “the status of the child as a subject of rights and as a human being with dignity and with evolving capacities”;\\n(j)  the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 10 December 2008 (ratified by Belgium) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 6 October 1999 (ratified by Belgium).', '47.  Several regional human rights texts and instruments also refer to the concept of dignity, including the following:\\n(a)  the American Convention on Human Rights of 22 November 1969 (Articles 5 § 2, 6 § 2 and 11 § 1);\\n(b)  the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1 August 1975, which stipulates that the States “will promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and freedoms all of which derive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his free and full development” (Principle VII);\\n(c)  the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights of 27 June 1981, Article 5 of which lays down that “[e]very individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status”;\\n(d)  the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine of 4 April 1997 (which Belgium has not signed), the Preamble to which affirms, inter alia, “the need to respect the human being both as an individual and as a member of the human species and ... the importance of ensuring [his] dignity”;\\n(e)  the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, the Preamble to which affirms that being “[c]onscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity”, and Article 1 of which states that “[h]uman dignity is inviolable [and] must be respected and protected” (see also Article 31 on “Fair and just working conditions”);\\n(f)  Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances of 3 May 2002 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which points out that the abolition of the death penalty is essential for the protection of everyone’s right to life and for the full recognition of the “inherent dignity of all human beings”;\\n(g)  the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings of 16 May 2005 (ratified by Belgium), the Preamble to which emphasises that “trafficking in human beings constitutes a violation of human rights and an offence to the dignity and the integrity of the human being” (see also Articles 6 and 16).', '48.  In a document entitled “CPT standards” (CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 – Rev. 2015), the CPT stated the following.\\n“97.  Bearing in mind its preventive mandate, the CPT’s priority during visits is to seek to establish whether juveniles deprived of their liberty have been subjected to ill-treatment. Regrettably, deliberate ill-treatment of juveniles by law-enforcement officials has by no means been eradicated and remains a real concern in a number of European countries. CPT delegations continue to receive credible allegations of detained juveniles being ill-treated. The allegations often concern kicks, slaps, punches or blows with batons at the time of apprehension (even after the juvenile concerned has been brought under control), during transportation or subsequent questioning in law-enforcement establishments. It is also not uncommon for juveniles to become victims of threats or verbal abuse (including of a racist nature) whilst in the hands of law-enforcement agencies.\\n... 126.  ... In a number of [juvenile detention centres] visited by the CPT, it was not uncommon for staff to administer a so-called ‘pedagogic slap’ or other forms of physical chastisement to juveniles who misbehaved. In this regard, the CPT recalls that corporal punishment is likely to amount to ill-treatment and must be strictly prohibited.”\\nThe CPT also noted the following in its ninth general activity report (CPT/Inf (99) 12), dated 30 August 1999:\\n“24.  In a number of other establishments visited [where juveniles were deprived of their liberty], CPT delegations have been told that it was not uncommon for staff to administer the occasional ‘pedagogic slap’ to juveniles who misbehaved. The Committee considers that, in the interests of the prevention of ill-treatment, all forms of physical chastisement must be both formally prohibited and avoided in practice. Inmates who misbehave should be dealt with only in accordance with prescribed disciplinary procedures.”', '49.  In its report to the Belgian Government on its visit to Belgium from 18 to 27 April 2005 (CPT/Inf (2006) 15, 20 April 2006) the CPT stated, among other things.\\n“11.  On the basis of all the information obtained during the visit, the CPT has come to the conclusion – as it did following its first three visits to Belgium – that the risk of a person being ill-treated by law-enforcement officers while in detention cannot be dismissed. Accordingly, the CPT recommends that the Belgian authorities continue to be vigilant in this area and make a special effort in the case of juveniles who have been deprived of their liberty.\\nThe CPT further recommends that law-enforcement officers be given an appropriate reminder at regular intervals that any form of ill-treatment of persons deprived of their liberty – including insults – is unacceptable, that any information regarding alleged ill-treatment will be properly investigated, and that anyone responsible for such treatment will be severely punished. 12.  More specifically, concerning allegations of ill-treatment by law-enforcement officers when arresting a suspect, the CPT has repeatedly noted that this process undeniably represents a difficult and dangerous task at times, in particular when the person concerned resists or the law-enforcement officers have good reason to believe that the person poses an imminent threat. However, the use of force when making an arrest must be kept to what is strictly necessary; furthermore, there can never be any justification for striking apprehended persons once they have been brought under control.”\\nThe CPT’s report on its visit to Belgium from 28 September to 7 October 2009 (CPT/Inf (2010) 24, 23 July 2010) contains the following passage in particular:\\n“13.  In the course of its visits to police stations, the CPT delegation met only a few people who were deprived of their liberty. Nevertheless, while visiting prisons, it met a large number of people who had recently been in police custody.\\nThe majority of the detainees who spoke to the delegation did not report any instances of deliberate physical ill-treatment during their time in police custody. However, the delegation heard a limited number of allegations of excessive use of force (such as blows inflicted after the person had been brought under control, or excessively tight handcuffing) in the course of an arrest (particularly in Brussels, Charleroi and Marcinelle). As the CPT has often acknowledged, arresting a suspect is undeniably a difficult and dangerous task at times, in particular when the person concerned resists or the police have good reason to believe that the person poses an imminent threat. Nevertheless, the CPT recommends that police officers be reminded that when making an arrest, the use of force must be kept to what is strictly necessary; furthermore, there can never be any justification for striking apprehended persons once they have been brought under control.”', '50.  In its Recommendation Rec(2001)10 on the European Code of Police Ethics adopted on 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe stated its conviction that \\n“public confidence in the police is closely related to their attitude and behaviour towards the public, in particular their respect for the human dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual as enshrined, in particular, in the European Convention on Human Rights”. \\nIt recommended that the governments of member States be guided in their internal legislation, practice and codes of conduct of the police by the principles set out in the European Code of Police Ethics appended to the Recommendation, with a view to their progressive implementation and the widest possible circulation of the text.', '51.  The Code states in particular that one of the main purposes of the police is to protect and respect the individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined, in particular, in the Convention (paragraph 1). In the section on “Guidelines for police action/intervention” it stipulates that “[t]he police shall not inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances” (paragraph 36) and that they “may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective” (paragraph 37). Furthermore, “in carrying out their activities, [they] shall always bear in mind everyone’s fundamental rights” (paragraph 43) and “police personnel shall act with integrity and respect towards the public and with particular consideration for the situation of individuals belonging to especially vulnerable groups” (paragraph 44).', '52.  The Preamble to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child (“child” being defined in Article 1 as being “every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier”) of 20 November 1989 (ratified by Belgium) refers to the above-mentioned declarations and emphasises that the need to afford special protection to the child has been recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (particularly in Articles 23 and 24), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (particularly in Article 10) and the relevant statutes and instruments of the specialised institutions and international organisations concerned with child welfare.', '53.  Several subsequent international and regional texts are based on recognition of the need to take account of the vulnerability of minors. For instance, the Preamble to the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse of 25 October 2007 (ratified by Belgium) states that “every child has the right to such measures of protection as are required by his or her status as a minor, on the part of his or her family, society and the State”, the child being defined as “any person under the age of 18 years” (Article 3 (a)). Reference might also be made to Recommendation CM/Rec(2008)11 on the European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures and Recommendation CM/Rec(2009)10 on integrated national strategies for the protection of children from violence, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 5 November 2008 and 18 November 2009 respectively. The former instrument emphasises the extreme vulnerability of juveniles deprived of their liberty (Appendix to the Recommendation, § 52.1).The latter emphasises that “children’s fragility and vulnerability and their dependence on adults for the[ir] growth and development call for greater investment in the prevention of violence and protection of children on the part of families, society and the State”. Very recently the CPT highlighted the particular vulnerability of juveniles in the context of detention (24th General Report of the CPT, 2013-2014 (CPT/Inf (2015) 1), January 2015 – see paragraph 3 and, under “Juveniles deprived of their liberty under criminal legislation”, paragraphs 98 and 99).'], 'applicants': ['BOUYID'], 'defendants': ['BELGIUM'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['11', '12', '124', '125', '126', '127', '128', '129', '130', '131', '132', '133', '134', '14', '15', '16', '25', '26', '45', '46', '47', '51', '52', '53', '68', '81', '83', '84', '86', '87', '88', '89']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44], 'explained_indices': [22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 23, 43, 44, 20, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 21, 11, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 12, 0, 2, 4, 1, 3], 'explained_distances': [-0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.08619906, -0.11978699, -0.12073712, -0.22429414, -0.25111598, -0.3917278], 'number_of_sentences': 45, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant, Mr Mohamed Nuri Al Akidi, was born in 1961.', '10.  The applicant was arrested on 10 September 1993 on charges that he had used forged documents in order to obtain unlawfully an excise tax refund. The amount at stake, in respect of which the applicant was eventually convicted, was 15,294,000 Bulgarian levs (the equivalent of 558,236 US dollars at the relevant time). The applicant had acted in concert with three other persons all of whom later submitted applications under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, 26 July 2001, and the cases of Hristov v. Bulgaria, no. 35346/97, and Mihov v. Bulgaria, no. 35519/97).', \"11.  The charges preferred against the applicant were based on Article 212 § 4 of the Penal Code, which provided for a sentence of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. The accusations concerned alleged false certification of fictitious exports of consignments of cigarettes which in reality had been sold in the country.\", '12.  On 5 April 1994 the preliminary investigation was completed and an indictment was submitted to the Plovdiv Regional Court. The prosecution relied on 33 witnesses and voluminous documentary material.', '13.  The Plovdiv Regional Court sat as a chamber of three judges: a president who was a professional judge and two lay judges.', '14.  The first hearing took place on 12 and 13 May 1994 when the Regional Court heard the four co-accused and several witnesses. Some of the witnesses did not appear. The prosecutor and the defence lawyers requested leave to submit further evidence. The court adjourned the hearing. On 16 May 1994 the court, sitting in private, appointed a graphology expert.', \"15.  Several times during the proceedings the Regional Court had to wait for the case file to be returned by the Supreme Court in Sofia, where it had been sent for the examination of the appeals submitted by the applicant and his co-accused against the Regional Court's refusals to release them on bail. In practice, whenever such an appeal was submitted, the Plovdiv Regional Court transmitted the case file together with the appeal and a prosecutor's opinion.\", \"16.  The case file was sent to the Supreme Court on 28 May 1994 for one of the co-accused's appeal against detention to be examined and was returned on 30 June 1994.\", '17.  The Regional Court did not deal with the case until 13 September 1994, when the presiding judge ordered the production of a piece of evidence.', '18.  The trial resumed on 6 October 1994. The court heard several witnesses and adjourned the hearing as the prosecutor insisted on the examination of other witnesses who had not appeared and in order to enable the accused persons to submit further evidence. Some of the witnesses who had not appeared were ordered to pay fines.', '19.  The next trial hearing took place on 29 and 30 November 1994. The financial expert appointed by the court stated that he had been denied access to certain documents and therefore had not finalised his report. The court ordered a bank and the customs office to provide access to the documents in question. Two additional financial experts were also appointed. Both the prosecution and the defence sought to adduce additional evidence. The hearing was adjourned.', '20.  Between 20 January and 21 February 1995 the case file was in Sofia at the Supreme Court for the examination of appeals against detention.', '21.  The hearing listed for 19 April 1995 was adjourned as the presiding judge was ill.', '22.  The next hearing, scheduled for 9 June 1995, was adjourned as one of the lay judges had been taken ill.', '23.  On 12 July 1995 the court sitting in private ordered an expert report.', \"24.  The hearing listed for 21 September 1995 was adjourned owing to the illness of the applicant's lawyer. The court also observed that several witnesses had not been summoned properly and that others, albeit summoned, had not appeared.\", '25.  Between 3 October and 6 November 1995 the case file was in Sofia at the Supreme Court, which was examining appeals against detention.', '26.  The next hearing, listed for 12 January 1996, had to be adjourned as both lay judges were ill.', '27.  After learning that the lay judges were prevented by illness from further participation in the proceedings, on 19 February 1996 the Plovdiv Regional Court recommenced the examination of the case with two new lay judges. On that date the court appointed two additional experts.', \"28.  The new chamber of the court held a hearing on 26 and 27 March 1996. It heard several witnesses and experts. The hearing was adjourned as some of the witnesses had not been summoned due to an omission on the part of the court's clerk and because the parties sought to adduce further evidence. The court fixed the date for the next hearing to 7 and 8 May 1996.\", '29.  On 7 and 8 May 1996 the court heard several witnesses and an expert. The hearing was adjourned as further evidence had to be obtained.', '30.  Between 9 and 28 May 1996 the case file was at the Supreme Court in Sofia in connection with appeals against detention.', '31.  The hearing scheduled for 16 and 17 September 1996 was adjourned to 29 and 30 October 1996 as a lay judge had broken his leg and was unable to attend.', '32.  The hearing of 30 October 1996 was further adjourned, because the medical experts considered that one of the co-accused was not in a condition to participate in the hearing as he was on a hunger strike.', '33.  Between 19 November and 4 December 1996 the case file was in Sofia at the Supreme Court in connection with appeals against detention. In its cover letter to the Supreme Court, the Regional Court drew attention to the fact that a hearing had been listed for 19 December 1996 and called for the return of the case file before that date.', '34.  The hearing resumed on 19 December 1996. One witness and the experts were heard. As other witnesses had not appeared, the court accepted the requests of the defence lawyers and the prosecutor for a further adjournment.', '35.  The Regional Court throughout the proceedings sought police assistance to establish the addresses of witnesses and bring them before the court. One of the witnesses was suspected of seeking to evade service of the summonses.', '36.  The last hearing before the Plovdiv Regional Court took place on 28‑31 January 1997. The court heard witnesses and the submissions of the parties to the criminal case and examined other evidence.', \"37.  On 31 January 1997 the applicant was found guilty of having forged tax documents with a view to obtaining an unlawful gain. He was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment. His accomplices were also convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between ten and thirteen years.\", '38.  The court reserved the reasoning of its judgment. It was prepared on an unspecified date at least three months following the delivery of the judgment.', '39.  On 7 February 1997 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation against his conviction and sentence.', '40.  The case was listed for a hearing on 26 September 1997. On that date the prosecutor appointed to act before the Supreme Court of Cassation declared that he had known one of the convicted persons and that he wished to withdraw. The examination of the case could not proceed and the hearing was adjourned.', '41.  The hearing was held on 23 January 1998.', \"42.  By judgment of 16 March 1998 the court upheld the applicant's conviction and sentence.\", '43.  On 27 March 1998 date the applicant submitted a petition for review (cassation).', '44.  On 10 June 1998 the Supreme Court of Cassation held a hearing in the review (cassation) proceedings. As one of the co-accused joined the proceedings at that moment, the court adjourned the hearing to enable him to make the necessary submissions, which he did on 22 June 1998.', '45.  The hearing resumed on 9 December 1998.', '46.  On 22 March 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the petitions for review of the applicant and the other accused persons.', '47.  At all stages of the proceedings the applicant was legally represented.', '48.  On 10 September 1993 the applicant was arrested and detained pending trial.', \"49.  On 22 September 1993 the applicant's lawyer filed an application for his client's release with the Regional Public Prosecutor. The application was dismissed on 1 October 1993 on the grounds that the charges concerned a crime punishable by more than ten years imprisonment and that there were no circumstances excluding the necessity of the detention. In particular, the applicant was a foreign citizen and, therefore, there was a danger of his absconding.\", '50.  On 26 October 1993 the applicant appealed to the Regional Court stating that he was a political emigrant and could not return to Iraq and that his passport had been confiscated by the Bulgarian authorities. Furthermore, he had been living in Bulgaria for more than 12 years and his Bulgarian wife was expecting a child.', '51.  On 3 November 1993 the Regional Court sitting in private dismissed the appeal holding that the applicant had been charged with a serious wilful offence and that there was a danger of his absconding, committing further offences or obstructing the course of justice.', '52.  In March 1994 five persons who had been heard as witnesses in the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his accomplices were charged with perjury. Separate proceedings were brought against them.', '53.  At the hearing on 6 October 1994 the applicant requested his release on bail stating that he had been detained for more than one year and that he had a family and a permanent address. On the same day the Regional Court dismissed the applications for release filed by all co-accused stating that the charges carried a penalty of ten or more years imprisonment and that there were “no grounds to consider it established that the defendants would not abscond or commit a crime”. The family situation and health condition of the accused persons did not require their release.', \"54.  On 30 November 1994 the Regional Court refused the applicant's renewed application for release, stating that there were no new circumstances.\", '55.  The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court. He stated that the authorities had not provided any evidence as to the existence of a danger of his absconding, re-offending or obstructing the course of justice and that the charges against him had been weak. He also submitted that all relevant evidence had already been collected.', \"56.  On 4 December 1994 the Plovdiv Regional Court, before transmitting the appeal to the Supreme Court, sitting in private, examined the matter again and refused to reverse its decision of 30 November 1994. The court held, inter alia, that according to the domestic law and the Supreme Court's practice detention pending trial was prima facie necessary when a person had been accused of having committed a serious wilful offence. To substitute this judicial measure by a more lenient one would only be possible if there had been “not even a hypothetical danger that the accused might abscond or commit further offences”, in particular, “if he is ill or elderly”.\", \"57.  On 21 February 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal against the applicant's detention.\", \"58.  The Supreme Court explained its practice in matters of pre-trial detention stating that under Article 152 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure remand in custody was mandatory for everyone accused of a crime punishable by ten or more years' imprisonment, the only exception being where it was clear beyond doubt that there was no danger of the accused absconding or re-offending. In the Supreme Court's view such would only be the case where, for example, the accused was seriously ill, elderly or in any other condition which excluded the danger of his or her absconding or re-offending. Since the applicant was charged with a crime punishable by more than ten years' imprisonment and as no special circumstances excluding the danger of his absconding or re-offending had been established, there were no grounds for ordering his release on bail. The Supreme Court referred to its practice on the matter.\", \"59.  The Supreme Court further refused to consider the applicant's contention that the evidence against him was weak. It found that it had no jurisdiction to do so in connection with a bail application. Its only task was to examine whether the conditions for pre-trial detention under Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been met.\", '60.  At the hearing on 21 September 1995 before the Plovdiv Regional Court the applicant again appealed against his detention on the grounds that he had not committed an offence, that he had a permanent address and had been fully co-operating with the authorities during the preliminary investigation.', '61.  The prosecutor objected, stating, inter alia, that under the relevant law, and regard being had to the increase in the crime rate in the country, the court was not entitled to release the applicant or the other co-accused.', '62.  On 21 September 1995 the Regional Court dismissed the application for bail, holding that there were no new circumstances and that the domestic law required pre-trial detention to be imposed in all cases when a person had been accused of having wilfully committed a serious offence.', '63.  Another application for release was dismissed on 19 February 1996 at the trial hearing before the Plovdiv Regional Court on the ground that the applicant was charged with a serious wilful crime which automatically required the imposition of pre-trial detention in accordance with Article 152 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '64.  At the hearing on 27 March 1996 the applicant renewed his application for release on bail arguing, inter alia, that since all evidence in his case had already been gathered, there was no danger of his absconding or obstructing the course of justice. He also invoked the Convention. The Regional Court dismissed the application on the same day, holding that there were no new facts which required his release and that the length of pre-trial detention was not limited by statute', '65.  On 28 January 1997, at the trial hearing, the applicant applied for release on bail.', \"66.  On 31 January 1997 the applicant was found guilty and was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment.\"], 'applicants': ['AL AKIDI'], 'defendants': ['BULGARIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '5'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '68'], '6': ['10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '77', '79', '80'], '41': ['10', '2']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'explained_indices': [5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 0, 41, 40, 39, 38, 35, 36, 42, 34, 33, 37, 43, 46, 45, 32, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 44, 31, 28, 29, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 30, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 56, 18, 57, 2, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.2894216, 0.28141737, 0.2537784, 0.25273952, 0.23293355, 0.16730222, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.06596649, 0.012363493, -0.23522216], 'number_of_sentences': 58, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

He is a journalist.', \"6.  The applicant is a member of Hyde Park, an unincorporated non-governmental organisation from Chişinău lobbying, inter alia, for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Following a demonstration organised by the organisation on 8 May 2008, the applicant's brother, also a member of the organisation, was arrested and placed in detention. As the applicant was unable to trace his brother for two days, he decided to go on hunger strike.\", \"7.  On 10 May 2008 at 10 a.m. the applicant stood outside the Government building in Chişinău's main square, positioned a placard with the inscription “Hunger strike for rights” and started his silent protest. Shortly afterwards, police officers approached him and some asked him questions while others filmed him.\", '8.  At approximately 10.45 a.m. the applicant was approached by two persons wearing plain clothes. In a video filmed by the applicant, one of the persons can be seen ordering him to stop filming. The applicant refuses and says that he is a journalist on hunger strike. He asks them for identification. One of the two persons hits the applicant, apparently in the hand holding the camera, and threatens him in rude terms with violence if he does not stop filming. The applicant backs away, insisting that he has the right to film, and asks for the identity of the aggressor. The aggressor says that he is C.A., Commander of the Special Forces police regiment “Scut”. He says that he only wants to talk and insists that the applicant stop filming. The applicant asks why he does not want to talk with the camera on. C.A. retorts that he is not an actor to be filmed. The applicant asks for identification documents and, at that moment, he receives another blow from Mr C.A. He continues to back away while being followed by the second police officer who appears to forcefully put an end to the filming. The video resumes for several seconds in what appears to be a police van taking the applicant away from the scene of the event.', \"9.  In another video, filmed by the police from another angle, the scene with the two police officers and the applicant can be seen from a distance. The camera approaches when the second police officer forcefully puts an end to the applicant's filming, seizing the applicant by his clothes and hands. The applicant asks the police officer not to use force and insists that he has the right to protest. The police officer retorts that by protesting the applicant is breaching the rights of other persons. At that moment two uniformed police officers approach and apprehend the applicant. They take him to a police van without any resistance from the applicant.\", '10.  The applicant arrived at the police station at approximately 11 a.m. His personal effects were taken away and he was questioned for approximately two hours. According to him, he insisted on being informed of the reasons for his arrest, but to no avail.', '11.  He was detained for forty-eight hours in solitary confinement in a cell without windows. The temperature in the cell was approximately fourteen degrees centigrade and he was wearing light clothes. There was a concrete bed in the cell, covered with wooden boards but without any bedding. There were no sanitary facilities and the applicant had to ask the guards to be taken to a toilet. The guards reacted to his request only one or two hours later, when he screamed out loud in order to be heard by their superiors. The only water the applicant had to drink was water from the sink in the toilet. Throughout his detention he was given no food and nobody was allowed to visit him. The cell was lit with a low-energy bulb which was on continuously, with no possibility to switch it off.', '12.  After twelve hours of detention the applicant felt unwell. His request for a doctor was ignored and only the next morning was a doctor called and the applicant taken by ambulance to a hospital. The doctors at the hospital diagnosed him with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and renal colic (extremely sharp and severe pain caused by a renal stone blocking the ureter), and decided to hospitalise him. However, the police officer accompanying him refused.', \"13.  On 12 May 2008 at 11 a.m. the applicant was taken to the Buiucani District Court, where he learned that he had been charged with the offences of insulting police officers and resisting arrest. In particular, the police accused him of calling them “rats”, “cowards” and “Voronin's dogs” when they peacefully approached him.\", '14.  At the end of the hearing, at 3 p.m., the applicant was released. Since he had no money or mobile telephone, he had to walk to the police station to pick up his belongings without laces on his shoes and without a belt.', \"15.  At the police station he discovered that the memory of his video camera (approximately forty-five minutes of film) had been erased. He sealed the camera in the presence of two witnesses who signed a document attesting to the sealing. The police officer responsible for the storage of the applicant's belongings refused to sign the document. The same day the applicant took his camera to an expert who succeeded in recovering 7-10% of the contents of the erased memory, including the images described in paragraph 8 above.\", \"16.  On 15 May 2008, the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor's Office, complaining about the actions of the police officers. He complained that the police officers had breached several provisions of the Criminal Code. In particular, they had physically and verbally aggressed him, dispersed a peaceful protest held in accordance with the law, unlawfully deprived him of his liberty for forty-eight hours, and unlawfully searched him, seized his possessions and erased the memory of his video camera. However, on 26 May 2008 the complaint was dismissed. The applicant appealed. In his appeal he added that he had been held in inhuman and degrading conditions and that he had not been provided with appropriate medical assistance.\", \"17.  In the meantime, the video of the applicant's verbal and physical abuse in front of the Government building (see paragraph 8 above) became the subject matter of a media scandal. Several television stations reported on the event and broadcast the video footage. As a result, on 28 May 2008 the Minister of Internal Affairs formally admonished the two police officers, C.A. and V.O. The applicant was accused of having provoked the police officers by insulting them and resisting arrest. He was also described as someone with a systematic tendency to disturb public order. Without any explanations, the police officers received an admonishment for breaching several rules of police conduct, in particular unprofessional conduct, dishonesty and failure to indentify themselves.\", \"18.  On 5 June 2008 the Buiucani District Court delivered its judgment, acquitting the applicant of all charges. After examining the videos of the applicant's encounter with the police and his arrest of 10 May 2008 (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above) and after hearing witnesses, the court found that the accusations against the applicant were false and that he had not insulted the police officers or resisted arrest.\", \"19.  On 15 June 2008 the Chişinău Prosecutor's Office dismissed the applicant's appeal on the ground that the police officers' behaviour did not disclose an offence. It was noted that the applicant had insulted the police officers by calling them “rats”, “cowards” and “Voronin's dogs” and that the two police officers who had physically and verbally assaulted the applicant had been admonished for their behaviour. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision.\", \"20.  On 2 July 2008 the Buiucani District Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the Chişinău Prosecutor's Office's decision of 15 June 2008.\"], 'applicants': ['BREGA'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['11', '3', '5'], 'violated_articles': ['11', '5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['18'], '3': ['38'], '11': ['21']}, 'silver_rationales': [13], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [13], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'explained_distances': [0.25141627, 0.24309692, 0.1446923, 0.08959991, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938, 0.01292938], 'number_of_sentences': 16, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\\nApplication no. 32921/03', '6.  Through the acquisition of shares before January 2001, the first two applicants became minority shareholders of Českomoravský cement, a.s., a joint stock company incorporated under Czech law.', \"7.  On 1 January 2001 the Commercial Code (hereinafter “the CC”) was amended. In accordance with its newly introduced Article 220p, a general meeting of a joint stock company was empowered to decide to wind up the company and transfer all its assets to a shareholder who owned shares representing more than 90% of the company's share capital (“the main shareholder”). An asset transfer contract between the main shareholder and the company was to be concluded to that end and compensation paid to the minority shareholders.\", '8.  On 31 May 2001 the general meeting of the company adopted, by votes of the main shareholder, a resolution on the winding-up of the company and on the transfer of all its assets to the main shareholder (together also referred to as “the transfer”).', '9.  On the same day the applicants filed an action to have that resolution and the asset transfer contract set aside with the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud). They asserted that the resolution had been adopted contrary to law, treaties concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments and their property rights. They informed the court administering the commercial register (obchodní rejstřík) about this step.', '10.  On 31 October 2001 the court administering the commercial register (rejstříkový soud) approved the transfer. No hearing was held prior to that decision.', '11.  On 14 December 2001 the applicants contested the decision to register the transfer before the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud), alleging an infringement of the right to a fair trial and their property rights. They claimed not to have been able to raise their objections to the general meeting resolution in a hearing during the non-contentious proceedings preceding the delivery of the decision. They invited the court to strike down inter alia Articles 220h(3) and (4) and 220p of the CC.', \"12.  On 25 March 2003 the Constitutional Court in its decision no. IV. ÚS 720/01 rejected the applicants' appeal without holding a hearing. It found that the applicants were not entitled to participate in the proceedings as the task of the court in charge of the commercial register had been to decide on the rights of the company, not on theirs. It noted that that court had the applicants' arguments in their action to set aside at its disposal and had taken them into consideration before delivering the impugned decision, whilst reviewing the lawfulness of the resolution as a preliminary question. It held that the power to stay the proceedings was still available to that court under the law as it stood at the relevant time. The Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants' second claim according to which that decision amounted to other interference by public authority into their right to access to a court. Referring to Article 220h of the CC, it found the application of Article 131 of the CC in conformity with constitutional law. In this regard, the court pointed to procedural safeguards enshrined in Articles 131, 220h, 220k, 2201 and 220p of the CC which were available to the applicants, and emphasised the aim of the regulation providing for legal certainty and expeditious transformation of companies. As for the applicants' challenge to the law providing for the winding-up and the transfer on the ground of insufficient protection of the rights of minority shareholders, the court did not examine it since it went beyond the scope of that court's review defined by the applicants' constitutional appeal contesting the decision in which the court in charge of the commercial register had approved the registration of the winding-up and the transfer at the commercial register, but not any decisions adopted in other proceedings available to the complaining minority shareholders.\", \"13.  On 27 July 2006 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicants' action lodged on 31 May 2001. Having noted that the court in charge of the commercial register had approved the registration of the transfer, the Municipal Court, referring to Article 131(3)(c) of the CC, refused to deal with the applicants' assertions of unlawfulness of the impugned general meeting resolution, their principal allegation being that the resolution had been adopted by the main shareholder whose voting rights had been suspended. As for the applicants' plea of invalidity of the asset transfer contract, namely the insufficient number of experts commissioned for the expert report on the compensation and the determination of the decisive day (rozhodný den), the court expressed the view that the validity of the asset transfer contract must have been examined as a preliminary question by the court approving the registration of the transfer into the commercial register. At the same time, having reviewed the contract, the Municipal Court found that the determination of decisive day complied with the CC. Having interpreted relevant provisions of the CC, the court further found that the law did not require that more experts be commissioned for the purposes of assessing the compensation to be paid by the main shareholders to the applicants. Finally, the court examined and dismissed the applicants' claims that the compensation had not been properly determined as unfounded or reviewable only by a court reviewing the compensation in separate proceedings.\", \"14.  On 6 September 2007 the Prague High Court (vrchní soud), sharing the legal view of the court of first instance, upheld the Municipal Court's judgment of 27 July 2006.\", '15.  The proceedings are now pending before the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud). According to the applicants, they have no prospect of success before that jurisdiction due to its settled case law.', '16.  According to the Government, the applicants filed with a court actions under Article 220k of the CC whereby they asserted that the compensation paid for the transfer pursuant to Article 220p(2) of the CC was not adequate and claimed the remainder thereof. According to the Government, these proceedings and the set-aside proceedings are still pending.\\nApplication no. 28464/04', '17.  The third applicant owned 3% of the share capital of YTONG, a.s., a joint stock company incorporated under Czech law.', '18.  On 24 June 2003 the general meeting of that company adopted, by votes of the main shareholder, a resolution on the winding up of the company and the transfer of all its assets to the main shareholder.', '19.  On 25 June 2003 the third applicant filed with the Brno Regional Court (krajský soud) an action to have the resolution set aside, asserting that it had been adopted contrary to the applicable law, treaties concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments and their property rights. Asserting the unlawfulness of the asset transfer contract on account of its clause reserving for arbitration jurisdiction over disputes concerning the value of the compensation, she further emphasised a number of irregularities of the resolution. She informed the court administering the commercial register about the action.', '20.  On 1 September 2003 the court in charge of the commercial register approved the registration of the transfer. No hearing was held before that decision, which was not served on the third applicant as she did not have standing to participate in the proceedings.', \"21.  On 11 December 2003 the Olomouc High Court rejected the third applicant's appeal contesting that decision. It ruled that since the applicant did not have standing to take part in the impugned proceedings, she was not entitled to appeal their outcome.\", '22.  On 28 November 2005 the High Court, relying on Article 220h(4) of the CC, discontinued the set-aside proceedings without examining the merits.', '23.  According to the Government, the third applicant filed with a court an action under Article 220k of the CC whereby she asserted that the compensation for the transfer paid pursuant to Article 220p(2) of the CC was not adequate and claimed the remainder thereof.', '24.  According to the parties, these proceedings are after dismissive rulings of courts of first two instances pending before the Supreme Court.', \"25.  On 24 June 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal on points of law and upheld the High Court's ruling of 28 November 2005.\", \"26.  On 11 December 2008 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant's constitutional appeal, in which the applicant claimed an impairment of her right to a fair trial in the set-aside proceedings by reason of the limitation on access to court brought about by Article 220h(4) of the CC. The Constitutional Court found that the Supreme Court had not erred in its impugned decision of 24 June 2008 and that neither the applicant's right to a fair trial nor any other constitutional right had been breached.\", '27.  The third applicant also raised the claim for compensation, together with two other petitioners, before an arbitration tribunal to which she was referred in the decisions of the ordinary courts. The arbitration proceedings were discontinued and the petition rejected on 11 October 2006 for lack of jurisdiction.\\nApplication no. 5344/05', '28.  The first applicant was a minority shareholder of Biocel, a.s., a joint stock company incorporated under Czech law.', \"29.  On 21 November 2001 the company's general meeting decided to wind up the company and transfer its assets to the main shareholder.\", '30.  On the same day the applicant brought an action in the Ostrava Regional Court (krajský soud) to have the general meeting resolution and the asset transfer contract set aside. He argued that the general meeting resolution was void on the grounds of unlawfulness as the main shareholder had taken part in the vote although not entitled to do so, the resolution had been adopted despite the fact that the shares had been lodged as securities, and the compensation payable to minority shareholders had been determined improperly. He further asserted a violation of treaties concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.', '31.  On 12 November 2002 the Regional Court, acting as a court in charge of the commercial register, approved the registration of the transfer at the commercial register without holding a public hearing.', '32.  On 21 November 2002 an appeal by the first applicant against this decision was rejected by the Olomouc High Court, which found that the minority shareholders were not parties to the proceedings concerning the approval of the registration at the commercial register.', '33.  On 14 January 2003 the Regional Court stayed the set-aside proceedings and asked the Constitutional Court to strike down Article 220p and other provisions of the Commercial Code.', '34.  On an unspecified date the first applicant filed a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of his right to judicial protection under Article 36 § 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod). He claimed that he had not been allowed to act as a party in the proceedings conducted by the court in charge of the commercial register and had been prevented de facto, by Articles 131(3)(c), 220h(4), 220p of the CC and 109(2)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter “the CCP”), from acting before the court in the proceedings to set aside the general meeting resolution. He further contended that the relevant law was contrary to the Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC. The first applicant requested that the aforementioned provisions be struck down as being contrary to Article 36 § 1 of the Charter.', \"35.  On 31 August 2004 the Constitutional Court by its decision no. II. ÚS 21/03 rejected the applicant's constitutional appeal against the decision approving the registration of the transfer at the commercial register. It found that, under Article 131 of the CC a court in charge of the commercial register is entitled to review as a preliminary question the lawfulness and validity of a general meeting resolution on the basis of which a registration in the commercial register is to be made. It held that the right to judicial protection was not denied to the first applicant having regard to the remedies enshrined in Article 131 taken in conjunction with Articles 220h, 220k, 2201 and 220p of the CC. Therefore, shareholders of a joint stock company could seek protection of their rights before an independent and impartial court by another way than by taking part in the proceedings held before the court in charge of the commercial register.\", \"36.  On 22 February 2005 the Plenary of the Constitutional Court rejected by its decision no. Pl. ÚS 51/03 the request of the Regional Court that it should strike down, inter alia, Article 220p of the CC. It found that the Regional Court's request was ill-founded as Article 220p of the CC could no longer be applied by the Regional Court on account of Article 131(3)(c) of the CC, which barred that court from deciding the case before it on the merits once the general meeting resolution on the winding-up of the company and the transfer had been inserted into the commercial register. Four constitutional judges joined their dissenting opinions to the Plenary's decision.\", '37.  On 14 March 2008 the Ostrava Regional Court, relying on Article 220h(4) of the CC discontinued the set-aside proceeding without examining the merits as the transfer was registered in the commercial register.', \"38.  On 1 July 2008 the Olomouc High Court upheld that decision of the Regional Court. Referring to the Constitutional Court's decision no. IV. ÚS 720/01, the High Court found Articles 131(3)(b) and (c) and 220h(3) and (4), and Article 220k(1) of the CC conform with Czech law including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. The first applicant did not pursue the case before higher instances. He alleged to have no prospect of success due to the settled case law of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court.\", '39.  According to the Government, the applicant filed with a court an action under Article 220k of the CC whereby he asserted that the compensation for the transfer paid pursuant to Article 220p(2) of the CC was not adequate and claimed the remainder thereof According to the Government, these proceedings are still pending.'], 'applicants': ['KOHLHOFER', 'MINARIK'], 'defendants': ['CZECH REPUBLIC'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['101', '103', '105', '12', '13', '19', '33', '35', '36', '74', '80', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 30, 31], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 30, 31], 'explained_indices': [5, 6, 4, 2, 0, 7, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 28, 21, 30, 31, 32, 27, 20, 17, 18, 33, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 19, 34, 3, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.15566272, 0.14700526, 0.11921406, 0.098968446, 0.09174043, 0.076075435, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.070556164, 0.06841493, 0.048838854], 'number_of_sentences': 35, 'article_id': 11, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

Between 1991 and 1994 he was the mayor of Samokov.', \"8.  On 27 May 1993 the District Prosecutor's Office (Районна прокуратура) in Samokov opened criminal proceedings against the applicant. It was alleged that the applicant in his capacity as mayor of Samokov had bestowed unlawfully benefits to individuals by granting tenancy orders and authorising construction works (abuse of office contrary to Article 282 §§ 1 and 2 of the Penal Code), that he had made a false certification in an official document (Article 311 § 1 of the Penal Code), and that he had used offensive language in respect of several persons (Articles 146 and 148 § 1(3)(4)).\", \"9.  As a measure to secure the applicant's appearance before the competent authorities, he was required to sign an undertaking that he would not leave Samokov without authorisation. This undertaking apparently remained in force throughout the proceedings.\", \"10.  On 16 June 1993 the case was assigned to an investigator. On 14 July 1993 the applicant was questioned. On 27 July 1993 the investigator heard one witness. On 11 August 1993 the investigator concluded his work on the case and drew up a report proposing the termination of the proceedings, as the applicant's acts did not constitute criminal offences.\", \"11.  On 24 September 1993 the District Prosecutor's Office referred the case back for further investigation. On an unspecified date the case was assigned to another investigator.\", \"12.  On 18 January 1994 the Regional Prosecutor's Office (Окръжна прокуратура) in Sofia, acting under section 154 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ordered the suspension of the applicant's term as the mayor of Samokov as there was a danger that he would obstruct the investigation. Upon the applicant's appeal this decision was confirmed by the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office (Главна прокуратура). On 19 October 1994 the municipal council (общински съвет) removed the applicant from the post of mayor of Samokov. The removal was upheld on appeal by the Sofia Regional Court and by the Supreme Court.\", \"13.  In the continuing criminal proceedings, on 24 March 1994 the investigator proposed a temporary suspension of the proceedings as an important witness was allegedly in hiding. On 4 April 1994 the case was again referred back for further investigation by decision of the District Prosecutor's Office.\", '14.  On 6 September 1994 the investigator reformulated the charges and, in addition, charged the applicant under Articles 172 §§ 1 and 2 and 282 of the Penal Code in respect of allegedly unlawful payments to dismissed municipal employees and his refusal to comply with a judicial order reinstating an employee.', \"15.  On 31 October 1994 the District Prosecutor's Office terminated the proceedings in so far as they concerned the charges about payments to dismissed employees and in respect of some of the incidents where the applicant had allegedly used offensive language. On the same date the prosecutor drew up an indictment in respect of the alleged crimes under Articles 282 §§ 1, 2 and 3 and 311 § 1 of the Penal Code and also as regards the applicant's alleged failure to comply with a judicial order (Article 172 §§ 1 and 2 of the Penal Code) and the remaining incidents where the applicant allegedly employed offensive language (Articles 146 and 148 § 1(3)(4)).\", \"16.  During the preliminary investigation, in the period May 1993 - October 1994, the investigators examined numerous documents and heard ten witnesses. There is a dispute between the parties as to the number of experts' opinions ordered. According to the applicant they were six or seven, whereas the Government mentioned seventy-eight experts' opinions.\", '17.  The indictment was submitted to the Samokov District Court (Районен съд).', '18.  Between 17 January 1995 and 15 May 1996 the District Court held nineteen hearings. The court heard about one hundred witnesses and many experts and admitted voluminous documentary evidence. The hearings were held at regular intervals and most adjournments were considered necessary to allow for the examination of witnesses that had not appeared or the collection of other evidence requested by the applicant or the prosecution. The District Court imposed fines on witnesses who had failed to appear without good cause and sent urgent requests to the police for assistance in respect of witnesses whose whereabouts were unknown.', \"19.  By judgment of 17 May 1996 the applicant was convicted on some of the charges and was acquitted for the remainder. He was sentenced to one year and three months' imprisonment, suspended.\", '20.  On 29 May 1996 the applicant appealed to the Sofia Regional Court (Окръжен съд). The prosecutor also appealed and requested that the judgement of the District Court be quashed and the case referred back to the investigation authorities. The Regional Court held a hearing on 8 July 1996.', \"21.  By judgement of 23 July 1996 the Regional Court upheld the applicant's conviction under Article 311 § 1 and his acquittal under Article 172 §§ 1 and 2 of the Penal Code, quashed the remainder of the District Court's judgement and referred the latter part of the case back to the investigation authorities.\", \"22.  As a result, in respect of the charges of false certification in an official document under Article 311 § 1 of the Penal Code, the proceedings ended on 28 February 1997, when the Supreme Court of Cassation (Върховен касационен съд) dismissed the applicant's petition for review (cassation) against the conviction part of the Regional Court's judgment. As regards the alleged offences under Articles 146 and 148 § 1(3)(4) and Article 282 §§ 1 and 2 of the Penal Code, the criminal proceedings continued at the preliminary investigation stage.\", \"23.  The Regional Court remitted this part of the case to the investigation stage as it found a number of discrepancies between the initial charges and the indictment, mainly as regards the references to the legal provisions which the applicant had allegedly breached in abuse of his duties as a mayor. The Regional Court considered that as a result the applicant's defence rights had been curbed.\", \"24.  No investigation was carried out between July 1996 and April 1997 since, following the judgment of 23 July 1996, the case file only reached the District Prosecutor's Office in October 1996, but had to be transmitted in November 1996 to the Supreme Court of Cassation in relation to the applicant's petition for review (cassation) of the conviction part of the judgment. After the delivery of that court's judgment on 28 February 1997, the case file reached the competent investigator in April 1997.\", '25.  On each of the dates 7 May, 12 May and 2 June 1997 the investigator heard one witness.', \"26.  By letters of 8 August, 27 August, 23 September and 29 September 1997 the applicant inquired with the District Prosecutor's Office in Samokov about the course of the proceedings and requested the collection of evidence.\", '27.  On 31 October 1997 the investigator reformulated the charges against the applicant. On 7 November 1997 the applicant was informed thereof and was questioned. The applicant had five meetings with the investigator until 25 November 1997. The applicant refused to give explanations. He requested the collection of additional documentary material.', '28.  On 20 January 1998 the investigator sent requests for documentary material to several institutions.', '29.  By letters of 26 February and 21 May 1998 the applicant protested against the delays in the proceedings.', '30.  On 5, 6 and 7 August 1998 the investigator provided access to the case-file to three persons, the alleged victims. On 10 August 1998 the applicant appeared before the investigator, the material in the case was officially communicated to him and he was given the possibility to submit requests or objections. The applicant made a number of requests and remarks.', \"31.  On 21 August 1998 the investigator finalised the case and submitted it to the competent prosecutor proposing indictment. The prosecutor ordered further investigation to which the investigator objected. The ensuing dispute required the interference of the Regional Prosecutor's Office. Having examined the matter, on 11 June 1999 it ordered additional investigation.\", '32.  On 1 October 1999 the applicant was questioned by the investigator. On 5 October 1999 the applicant was provided access to all material in the case and invited to submit his final comments on the investigation. Thereafter, the case was transmitted to the competent prosecutor.', \"33.  By order of 17 November 1999 the District Prosecutor's Office terminated the proceedings in respect of a number of the charges. The applicant appealed stating, inter alia, that the order did not clarify the outstanding charges, so as to enable him to organise his defence.\", \"34.  On 17 August 2000 the Regional Prosecutor's Office modified the order of 17 November 1999, accepting that it had been unclear and wrongly reasoned. As a result, the charges on three counts of abuse of office under Article 282 of the Penal Code were dropped on the ground that the acts imputed to the applicant did not constitute criminal offences and some other charges were abandoned as unproven. The remaining accusations were modified.\", '35.  As of March 2001 the proceedings were pending at the preliminary investigation stage.', '36.  On an unspecified date the competent prosecutor drew up an indictment on 137 counts of abuse of office. The indictment ran on 35 pages and relied on seven witnesses, reports of nine experts and voluminous documentary material.', '37.  The indictment was submitted to the District Court which held a first hearing on 21 February 2002. On that date the case was adjourned until 22 April 2002.', '38.  On 27 March 1995 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant on suspicion that on 7 July 1992, at the time when he was mayor of Samokov, he had contravened Article 282 § 1 of the Penal Code (abuse of office) by ordering unlawfully the restitution of State property, a plot of land, to a private person, a Mr S.', \"39.  The property in question belonged to Mr S. until 1961 when the State had acquired it for the needs of the local post office. In 1992 Parliament enacted a law providing for the restitution of property nationalised under several pieces of legislation passed in the 1940s and 1950s. The plot of Mr S. had been acquired by the State in 1961 under other legislation and thus did not fall within the scope of the 1992 restitution law. Nevertheless, on 7 July 1992 the applicant had granted Mr S.'s request for restitution, citing as legal ground the 1992 restitution law.\", '40.  According to the charges, the procedure for examination of restitution requests by a commission of experts had not been followed. Furthermore, the order had no valid legal grounds and was issued by the applicant with the intention to bestow a benefit on Mr S.', '41.  In the meantime, on an unspecified date in 1994 the post office brought a civil action against Mr S. claiming the property back. Several months later, in 1995, the Regional Governor quashed the 1992 restitution order issued by the applicant and, upon the appeal of Mr S., separate civil proceedings commenced between Mr S. and the Regional Governor. In a third set of civil proceedings Mr S. sought to prove against the post office that the 1961 acquisition had been null and void. The proceedings involving the Regional Governor ended in 1997, and those between the post office and Mr S. in 2000. The 1992 restitution order was eventually quashed and the plot of land returned to the local post office.', '42.  In the criminal investigation against the applicant, between 12 April and 31 July 1995 the investigator heard at least fifteen witnesses, questioned the applicant, commissioned three expert reports, and obtained documentary material from several institutions.', '43.  On 8 November 1995 the investigator concluded his work on the case and proposed to the competent prosecutor to submit an indictment in court. However, the proceedings remained dormant until August 1997.', '44.  On 4 August 1997 the prosecutor in charge of the criminal investigation against the applicant transmitted the file back to the investigator considering that the accusation was not supported by sufficient evidence and that, therefore, further investigation was necessary. In particular, it was necessary to establish the applicable rules and practice in the examination of restitution requests so as to clarify whether the applicant had acted in excess of his powers. The prosecutor also mentioned that the investigator should verify the outcome of the civil disputes concerning the ownership of the plot of land in question.', '45.  On 20 August 1999 the investigator drew up a concluding report and transmitted the file to the prosecutor.', \"46.  On 15 October 1999 the prosecutor terminated the proceedings finding that the applicant's intention to bestow an unlawful benefit had not been proven.\\nIn his decision, in the summary of facts, the prosecutor mentioned one of the two sets of civil proceedings described above, those opposing Mr S. against the local post office. Those proceedings were still pending at that time. The prosecutor's decision did not contain any statement as to the relevance of the civil case to the criminal proceedings against the applicant.\"], 'applicants': ['KITOV'], 'defendants': ['BULGARIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['14', '16', '18', '22', '23', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '51', '52', '53', '8'], '41': ['12', '55', '56', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'explained_indices': [4, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 21, 20, 39, 18, 8, 38, 10, 11, 12, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 13, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.075861216, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.03139615, 0.00066652894, -0.007636249, -0.03013733, -0.1212253, -0.3560241, -0.39183366, -0.40129167], 'number_of_sentences': 40, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant company is a joint stock company based in Ploieşti.', '5.  On 24 June 1998 the Supreme Court of Justice, by a final decision, ordered the S.C. Safa Impex S.R.L. company (“the S. company”) to pay the applicant company 533,683,270 old Romanian lei (ROL) as due payment resulting from a contract they had entered into and ROL 21,254,421 for the costs of proceedings. The court based its findings on an expert report which had updated the due amount on the basis of the inflation rate.', '6.  In August and September 1998 the S. company sold a part of its movable and immovable property to the S.C. Safa Comimpex S.R.L. company, which had as manager the wife of one of the two managers of the S. company.', '7.  Following refusal of payment by the S. company, on 17 September 1998 the applicant company requested the Prahova County Court to enforce that judgment.', '8.  On 19 January 1999 the S. company further sold a building to the same SC Safa Comimpex SRL company.', \"9.  On 10 February 1999 the Ploieşti District Court decided in private to attach the S. company's assets in the T. bank up to the total due amount of ROL 554,937,691.\", \"10.  On 5 April 1999, at the applicant company's request, the Ploieşti District Court upheld that attachment and ordered the bank to transfer that amount into the applicant company's account. An appeal by the bank was dismissed as groundless on 12 October 1999.\", \"11.  On 3 December 1999 the applicant company informed the Prahova County Court that the debtor had taken its money out of the T. bank and requested to continue enforcement by sale by public auction of debtor's immovable and movable property.\", '12.  On 6 December 1999 the bailiff R. served notice to the S. company to pay the debt. The debtor refused to receive that notice and the bailiff posted it on its door.', \"13.  On 16 December 1999 the bailiff requested information from the public finance office in respect of S company's movable and immovable property. In the absence of an answer by the finance office, the bailiff renewed that request on 15 February 2000.\", \"14.  On 6 April 2000 the public finance office submitted to the bailiff the debtor's balance sheet.\", '15.  On 1 May 2000 the S. company sold a vehicle to the wife of one its two managers.', \"16.  On 18 May 2000 the public finance office informed the bailiff about the S. company's assets, which included a building and four vehicles. Therefore, at an unknown date the bailiff R. seized the four vehicles and on 22 September 2000 he put them on sale by public auction. The sale was scheduled for 13 October 2000.\", \"17.  However, on 13 October 2000, following a visit to the S. company's premises, the bailiff R. certified in an official record that the debtor had sold the four above-mentioned vehicles to the S.C. Safa Comimpex S.R.L. company. The debtor also refused to pay, alleging that it had no other assets and had ceased to function.\", '18.  It appears from the file that the proceedings brought for the annulment of those sales were dismissed by the courts.', '19.  On 9 October 2002, following failure by the bailiff R. to enforce that judgment, the applicant company requested his replacement. The execution file was transferred to the bailiff M.', \"20.  On 30 October 2002 the bailiff M. requested the Ploieşti District Court to authorise the enforcement and the town council to inform him about the debtor's assets. On 12 November 2002 the court approved the enforcement by an interlocutory decision. By a letter of 18 December 2002 the town council informed the bailiff that the debtor was listed as the owner of two vehicles.\", \"21.  The S. company made an objection to the execution, alleging prescription of the applicant's right to claim enforcement. Eventually, on 25 April 2006 the Ploieşti District Court found that the action had lapsed.\", \"22.  On 2 May 2001 the applicant company lodged a criminal complaint against the two managers of the S. company, submitting that they had sold the company's assets and thus prevented the applicant company to recover the debt.\", '23.  On 29 November 2001 the public prosecutor found no reasons to start criminal proceedings.', \"24.  In 2002 the applicant company brought proceedings against the managers of the S. company, to hold them liable for the company's debts.\", \"25.  By an enforceable decision of 10 February 2005 the Prahova County Court allowed that action and ordered the two managers to pay the debt out of their personal property. The court based its findings on an accounting expert report which had found that the two managers of the S. company were at fault for its insolvency and that they had transferred its assets to another company, managed by the wife of one of them. Moreover, the value of those assets had not been updated to their market value and the payment ordered by the judgment of 24 June 1998 had not been recorded in the company's book of accounts. The court concluded that the aim of their entire activity was to avoid paying the debt to the applicant company.\", '26.  On 7 December 2007 the applicant company requested the bailiff T. to enforce that judgment. According to the applicant, one of the two managers is retired and they also have sold their personal assets.', '27.  Two invoices of 26 September and 28 October 2008 certified payment of two instalments of 117 new Romanian lei each.', '28.  On 8 November 2002 the applicant company presented a winding-up petition against the S. company.', '29.  On 11 December 2002 the Prahova County Court authorised the compulsory liquidation and appointed a trustee. That judgment became final on 24 February 2003.', '30.  On 9 February 2005 the S. company was declared bankrupt by the Prahova County Court. The court appointed the same trustee.', '31.  The trustee drew up a final report in which she certified that the S. company had no movable or immovable property to be sold. She therefore proposed the court to terminate the bankruptcy proceedings.', '32.  On 23 January 2006 the Prahova County Court, by an enforceable decision, terminated the bankruptcy proceedings and ordered that the S. company be struck off the trade register. The court also held that the enforcement of the judgment of 10 February 2005 (see paragraph 25 above) would be carried out according to the Code of Civil Procedure.', '33.

The first applicant is the father of Solomos Solomou, a Greek Cypriot who died on 14 August 1996. The remaining applicants are the first applicant’s children and Solomos Solomou’s siblings. Solomos Solomou was not married and did not have any children.', '9.  The parties disagree as to the facts of the case.', '10.  On 14 August 1996 Solomos Solomou attended the funeral of a man who had been killed during a demonstration against the Turkish occupation of part of Cyprus. With other persons, he entered the UN buffer zone near the spot of the killing. A road passed the buffer zone at that point, leading to checkpoints guarded by the Cypriot National Guard on the southern side and by officials of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) on the northern side. At the Turkish checkpoint there were two military sentry boxes, one on either side of the road leading into the occupied territory. There was also a Turkish flag on a pole situated just behind the Turkish sentry box. Near the sentry box there was a Turkish observation post on a two-storey house.', '11.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and the United Nations Civil Police (UNCIVPOL), some demonstrators, including Solomos Solomou, entered the buffer zone. Solomos Solomou and a handful of other demonstrators ran to the Turkish side of the buffer zone, pursued by UNFICYP personnel. Solomos Solomou crossed the barbed wire at the Turkish ceasefire line and entered the occupied territory. He was pursued by a British soldier from UNFICYP, who attempted to pull him back.', '12.  Solomos Solomou broke free from the British soldier and attempted to climb the pole where the Turkish flag was flying. He was unarmed, was not acting in a manner which could have been considered threatening and was smoking a cigarette. While he was approximately three metres up the pole he was hit by five shots fired by at least three persons from the Turkish side and was fatally injured. He died almost instantly. The Turkish forces then opened fire in an indiscriminate manner, wounding two members of UNFICYP, a civilian in the buffer zone and a civilian who was standing behind the Cypriot Government’s ceasefire line.', '13.  In order to support their version of facts, the applicants produced the following evidence:\\n(a) five statements from eyewitnesses (Lance Bombardier Sanders, Garda O’Reilly, Sergeant Hayward, Sergeant Whiley and Garda Brennan – see paragraphs 15-20 below);\\n(b) a collection of photographs prepared by the Cyprus police (see paragraph 31 below);\\n(c) a video film of the shooting (see paragraph 31 below);\\n(d) a pathologist’s report (see paragraph 29 below).', '14.  As to the identity of the perpetrators, the evidence pointed, in particular, to three persons: a man in civilian clothes who fired from the balcony of the Turkish observation post; a man in uniform standing near the Turkish check point; and a third man in Turkish uniform who fired from a distance of approximately 10 metres.', '15.  Before the Court, the applicants produced a number of statements from eyewitnesses. The relevant parts of these statements read as follows.', '16.  Statement of Lance Bombardier Michael John Sanders from UNFICYP:\\n“... Between two and three hundred Greek-Cypriot demonstrators were in the buffer zone and approached our formation. These people were in an agitated state, abusive, were singing patriotic songs and several were carrying Greek flags. I also saw several television cameras amongst the crowd. ...\\nThe demonstrators were becoming more agitated and were throwing missiles towards UN personnel and Turkish forces. ...\\nA short time later ... I saw a male person previously unknown to me, this person was between myself and the road and was jogging towards the Turkish-Cypriot fire line [TCFL]. This person was wearing black jeans and a black T shirt ... I also saw that this person was smoking.\\nThis person appeared to be extremely agitated and was verbally abusing UN and Turkish troops. I saw Lance Bombardier Booth run after this person and heard Booth yell out to the person to ‘stop’ and also to ‘get back’. The male person ran to a Turkish sentry box on the western side of Dherynia road where he got in between the coiled barbed wire and the sentry box. Booth caught the male person at this stage and held him by the shirt with one hand. The male person then broke free of this hold and run around the eastern side of the sentry box where I briefly lost sight of him. I next saw this person attempting to climb on the top of the sentry box which was unsuccessful. I then turned my back and attempted to prevent another person from going towards the TCFL. I heard a shot fired and turned around and saw the same male person attempting to climb a flagpole on the Turkish side of the TCFL.\\nI saw a Turkish Police officer with a drawn handgun aimed at the male person standing on Dherynia road, I saw this officer walk towards the male person and saw several muzzle flashes from the gun and heard several shots, I saw a wound on the male person’s neck and a large amount of blood from that wound. The male person then slid down the flagpole where I lost sight of him. The same police officer was firing at this time.\\nA volley of shots then rang out from the Turkish side of the TCFL. I ran towards the cover of two UN barrels, about 40 to 50 metres south of my location. I lay prone next to the barrels with my head turned and facing the TCFL. At this time I saw numerous muzzle flashes emanating from one or two positions within a grove of trees on the western side of the Derenyia road behind the TCFL. ...\\nSeveral rounds hit the barrels and the ground close to us whilst the volley of shots continued. .. I ... saw that Hudson had sustained a wound to his buttock. At this time shots were still being fired from the Turkish side of the TCFL. I administered first aid.\\nThe volley of shots ceased. I estimate that the volley of shots lasted between ten and twenty seconds ...\\nI approached the TCFL where I saw the male person who had attempted to climb the flagpole being carried under the TCFL coiled wire by members from IRCIVPOL. I saw that the person had sustained wounds on either side of the neck and chest.\\nThe Greek-Cypriot crowd that were still in the buffer zone became very aggressive towards UN personnel claiming that they could not get the required medical assistance for the person who had been shot. The situation did not settle until an ambulance had arrived and conveyed the person from the scene.”', '17.  Statement of Garda Pauroic O’Reilly, from UNFICYP:\\n“... A large crowd of people had gathered at this stage and the crowd was hostile. ... At this stage the crowd of people were making efforts to break through the barrier. The crowd were also throwing stones and other missiles at the UN personnel. They were advised on several occasions not to enter the buffer zone. A number of people then broke through the barrier and stated they wanted to lay a wreath where Tassos Isaak had died. They were advised they could not.\\nAt this time more people came through the barrier and started to head towards the ceasefire line. Efforts were been made to try and stop them but they continued onwards and would not listen to anybody. Some of the crowd carried iron bars, stones, sticks and flags. When the crowd got close to the Turkish position they started to throw stones at the Turkish position.\\nI would say there were 300 people in the buffer zone. A group of these people got to the murder scene and planted a Greek and Cyprus flag where he had been killed. They also removed the iron stakes which had marked the murder scene. The crowd [was] still hostile and angry.\\nThey started to sing and shout insults towards the Turkish forces. After planting the wreath and flags they moved over towards the road which leads to the Turkish checkpoint. They were still throwing stones and chanting insults. One of the group broke through and run up to the barbed wire and planted a Greek flag on it. When the flag was planted, Turkish forces appeared from a group of trees. I removed this flag ... The Turkish forces members returned to the trees when the flag was removed. I was continually telling people not to enter the buffer zone as it was dangerous and to return behind the UN barrier.\\nI noticed a man break through the UN lines and run towards the Turkish forces checkpoint. A member of BRITCON was in pursuit and caught the man at the barrier, the soldier appeared to lose his grip and let this man go and he crossed into [the] Turkish occupied area. He started to climb the flagpole with the Turkish [flag] on it. I then saw a Turkish soldier with a pistol fire shots, maybe two towards this man.\\nI saw blood spurt from this man’s neck and he slumped on the pole and fell to the ground. There was a burst of firing as this man fell to the ground and I saw two other Turkish soldiers firing rifles. I was 10 to 15 metres approximately from the shooting. I then took cover and remained on the ground till the shooting stopped. When I got up after the shooting I noticed members of BRITCON attending one of the men who had been shot. ...\\nWe removed the body from its position under the flagpole and passed it under the barrier to members of the UN and people in the crowd of demonstrators. The crowd took the body out of my view and placed it in a jeep ... When the body was passed under the barrier there was a Cyprus doctor there [who] started to render aid to this man who had been shot. ... There were no further incidents after the shooting ...”', '18.  Statement of Acting Station Sergeant Bruce Ihian Hayward, from UNFICYP:\\n“... I noticed that a group of Greek-Cypriot demonstrators, in my estimation to be in excess of 300, were at the CYPOL line attempting to break through. After a token effort by CYPOL, the demonstrators broke through the line with ease and approached the Southern barrier of the buffer zone. This barrier was manned by members of BRITCON and AUSCON. After numerous attempts to breach this line, the demonstrators were eventually successful and at the same time a large group of these demonstrators had run around the Western flank of the UN members and ran into the buffer zone. I saw that the majority of these demonstrators were carrying pieces of wood, metal and other objects.\\n... On numerous occasions, I was spat upon, verbally abused and pushed out of the way by the Greek-Cypriot demonstrators. In one instance I was threatened by a male demonstrator carrying a 10cm bladed knife, whom I have no doubt would have used it if I had not relinquished my position. At this stage, I saw a red flare overhead that had been fired from a southerly direction towards the Turkish side. When the demonstrators reached an area about 30 metres from the Turkish lines, they commenced to throw a barrage of rocks at the Turkish soldiers and police and at a building situated on the eastern side of the entrance barrier. All attempts to negotiate with the demonstrators by the UN personnel within the buffer zone failed both verbally and physically.\\nI was positioned at an area approximately 20 metres’ distance from the northern entrance barrier and 10 metres from the barbed wire barrier on the northern extremity of the buffer zone, when I saw a male demonstrator wearing black trousers and a black T-shirt with white writing on the front, run towards the entrance barrier of the Turkish-Cypriot side, closely pursued by a member of BRITCON.\\nAs the male person attempted to get between the barbed wire and a guard box on the western side of the entrance, a member of BRITCON grabbed hold of his shirt and attempted to pull him back. However, the BRITCON member was struck on his helmet by a rock thrown by one of the demonstrators and as a result, released his hold of the male demonstrator.\\nThe male demonstrator then attempted to climb onto the guard box but was unable to, so then started to climb a flagpole flying the Turkish flag which was situated on the western side of the entrance, several metres inside Turkish-Cypriot territory. I saw the male climb about three metres up the flagpole when I noticed a Turkish Army officer remove his pistol and commence shooting towards the male person on the flagpole. This Turkish officer was standing in the middle of the road facing in a southerly direction about 30 metres distance from the buffer zone barrier. I then saw two other Turkish army soldiers step out of some bushes on the western side of the barrier, about 25 metres away, and started firing their rifles in the direction of the male person on the flagpole. At this stage I saw an amount of blood appear on the male person’s neck just below the jaw line on the left hand side. The male then appeared to slide back down the flagpole onto the ground. I remember seeing the Turkish army officer who had fired his pistol running off into some bushes on the eastern side.\\nAt this stage, myself and other UN personnel immediately lay down on the ground. I believe I heard continual gunfire for a period of between 10 and 15 seconds and on several occasions, heard bullets passing over my head. At no time did I hear bullets being fired from the direction of the Greek-Cypriot demonstrators, nor did I see any of the demonstrators with firearms. The majority of the demonstrators then ran back towards the southern barrier of the buffer zone. When the gunfire had ceased, I saw that the Turkish army officers and police had left their original locations and could not be sighted.\\nShortly after, I saw IRCIVPOL members ... enter through the Turkish barrier and remove the body of the male person whom I had seen climbing the flagpole and had been subsequently shot. ...\\n... I was made aware that two BRITCON members had sustained gunshot wounds.”', '19.  Statement of Sergeant Geoffrey William Whiley, from UNFICYP:\\n“... After numerous attempts to breach this line [the UN barriers], the demonstrators were eventually successful and at the same time a large group of these demonstrators, numbering approximately 100 persons ran around the western flank of the UN members and into the buffer zone. I saw that many of these demonstrators were carrying pieces of wood, metal stakes, rocks and other objects. There were no visible firearms amongst the demonstrators.\\nAll UN members including all CIVPOL continually formed lines in an attempt to prevent the demonstrators from reaching the northern side of the buffer zone ... The Greek-Cypriot demonstrators were extremely agitated and violent towards UN members. I saw several UN soldiers get hit by rocks thrown from south to our position. The demonstrators then forced their way to a position about 15 metres south of the Turkish barbed wire barriers. There two flags were planted using a small rock cairn, apparently as a memorial. The demonstrators paused briefly at this point singing and shouting before moving generally back towards the roadway and continuing their yelling and rock throwing at the Turkish positions. There were many rocks thrown at Turkish positions which hit the buildings just north of the Turkish forces barriers.\\n... The UN soldiers and CIVPOL made many attempts to push the demonstrators back ..., all to no avail. I saw a red flare come from the demonstration group, fired into the sky over Turkish positions.\\nI was standing about 10 metres to the south of the Turkish barbed wire demarcation, approximately 15 metres to the west of the roadway. The roadway passes to the north between two guard posts located on either side of the roadway. There was a barbed wire barrier between the two guard posts. Beyond this position there were no further barriers to the Turkish positions.\\nI saw a demonstrator who was wearing a black shirt run towards the guard house located at the Turkish checkpoint. A BRITCON UN member chased this person. The demonstrator made his way through a gap between the guard house and [the] barbed wire gate. The BRITCON soldier grabbed hold of the demonstrator; however [he] lost his grip. The demonstrator ran past the barbed wire gate and was briefly lost from my sight. I then had a partial view of the demonstrator as he stood beside a flagpole located to the north of the guardhouse on the western side of the roadway. I saw a Turkish forces soldier approach from bushes further to the north and walk to a position about 10 metres from the flagpole. I saw he was carrying a firearm, which appeared to be some form of assault rifle. I saw him drop to one knee and raise his rifle to his right shoulder. I heard two spaced shots as this was happening.\\nAt this point the demonstrator had begun to climb up the flagpole and I had a clear view of him as he climbed higher. He did not appear to react to the first two shots as he continued to climb. I then heard a third shot and saw the demonstrator fall from the flagpole to the ground. I turned away at this point to look for some cover to move to. As I did this I heard a volley of rapid fire shots and I moved a few steps away from the firing line to a depression in the ground where I sought cover. After the firing ceased I stood up and moved back to the roadway area, I saw a BRITCON soldier lying on the ground and being attended by several other BRITCON soldiers. Myself and other UN soldiers began forcing media persons away to clear the area of the casualty. A short time later UN ambulances arrived.\\n... I saw the body of the wounded demonstrator taken by demonstrators who gradually moved off to the south.”', '20.  Statement of Garda Fidelma Brennan, from UNFICYP:\\n“... I saw approximately 25 uniformed Turkish police and 50 Turkish riot police in the area around the Turkish checkpoint. I also saw that these troops were well armed.\\n[At] about 13h56 I saw between thirty and forty demonstrators moving towards the Greek National Guard checkpoint on Dherynia Road. ... I saw no Cyprus police in that area.\\n... This group was joined by other demonstrators. As the number of demonstrators grew they eventually got past UN personnel at that location.\\n... [At] about 14h05 I saw the Greek-Cypriot demonstrators throw rocks towards the Turkish forces. The demonstrators at this stage were on the southern side of UN personnel deployed in crowd control formation. The demonstrators were throwing stones that were landing in the building TK34. UN soldiers and UNICIVPOL members were making every effort to prevent demonstrators getting past their position.\\nAt this time I was advised by Major Ilerici from the Turkish forces that if demonstrators went past the Turkish ceasefire line they would be shot. I attempted to relay this information but could not do so as I could not use my portable radio. I believe the reason for this was interference from Cyprus police channels.\\nI saw a man I would describe as fit and well built run towards a sentry box at the Turkish checkpoint on the right hand side of Dherynia road. This man attempted to climb the roof of the sentry box and then got down. I then saw this same man run towards the flagpole, I took cover and heard a shot fired. A short time later I heard a volley of shots fired. I made a note that I heard shots fired at 14h25. After the shots had ceased I looked down to the flagpole area, I saw the same man lying on the ground with his head pointing towards the Greek national guard checkpoint, he was facing towards UN OP 142.\\nAfter 14h30 I saw IRCIVPOL members ... remove the body of the man.”', '21.  According to the Government, the chain of events which led to the death of Solomos Solomou might be described as follows.\\n(a)  On 11 and 14 August 1996 serious disturbances occurred in the buffer zone.\\n(b)  The Greek-Cypriot Motorcycle Federation, with the support of the Greek-Cypriot authorities, had organised a rally which was meant to cross the ceasefire line and perform an illegal entry into the territory of the “TRNC”. The organisers had used abusive and degrading language and expressed violent intentions against the Turkish people in general.\\n(c)  These acts, accompanied by media coverage, led to tensions on both sides of the border.\\n(d)  The Turkish-Cypriot side repeatedly invited the Greek-Cypriot leadership to persuade the organisers of the rally to abandon the idea of illegally trespassing across the border and to enter the “TRNC” through the official entry point. These appeals were ignored.\\n(e)  The “TRNC” announced that it would stop such a provocative and aggressive action in order to protect its citizens.\\n(f)  The UN Deputy Special Representative in Cyprus and the UN Secretary-General called for respect for the integrity of the buffer zone. However, UNFICYP did not have sufficient personnel or means to effectively control and prevent large-scale demonstrations.\\n(g)  On 11 August 1996 thousands of Greek-Cypriot demonstrators, escorted by the Greek-Cypriot police, arrived at the Greek-Cypriot ceasefire line in Dherynia. The Greek-Cypriot police deliberately left the checkpoint unguarded in order to allow the demonstrators to enter the UN buffer zone. The situation developed into a violent riot when the demonstrators entered Turkish-Cypriot territory. They became involved in clashes with Turkish‑Cypriot counter-demonstrators. Hundreds of people were injured and a Greek Cypriot died.\\n(h)  The funeral of that person took place on 14 August 1996, in a climate of anti-Turkish feeling. The same day, at about 10 a.m., hundreds of Greek-Cypriot demonstrators once again entered the buffer zone and approached the ceasefire line.\\n(i)  In order to avoid further clashes, the “TRNC” authorities prevented counter-demonstrators from approaching the area. They also took all necessary measures to prevent forcible entry into their territory.\\n(j)  The Greek-Cypriot demonstrators carried the Greek flag and started throwing missiles into the Turkish-Cypriot area. As a precautionary measure, a Turkish-Cypriot police team was positioned, out of sight, in the vicinity of the ceasefire line.\\n(k)  The Greek-Cypriot demonstration developed into a riot and the demonstrators started rushing towards the Turkish-Cypriot ceasefire line. One of them unsuccessfully tried to run towards a sentry post, then started to climb the flagpole marking the Turkish-Cypriot ceasefire line. The other demonstrators threw stones, bottles, iron rods and other missiles. According to eyewitnesses, shots were also fired from the Greek-Cypriot side and at least one demonstrator posing as a cameraman was seen with an automatic pistol firing shots. At this stage, the Turkish-Cypriot police team came out from their position and fired in the air in order to stop the advance of the demonstrators and to prevent the situation getting out of control. There was then a crossfire as shots were fired from the Greek-Cypriot side.\\n(l)  Solomos Solomou was injured during the crossfire and was immediately picked up by UN personnel. Greek-Cypriot demonstrators prevented the UN from bringing an ambulance to the scene, thus hindering any chance of his survival. After having waited in the buffer zone, Mr Solomou was eventually picked up by a jeep and taken across to the Greek-Cypriot side. He later died from his injuries.', '22.  The Government of Cyprus observed that the Cypriot police had conducted an in-depth investigation into the circumstances surrounding the killing of Solomos Solomou, in cooperation with UNFICYP. Having regard to the results of these investigations, the facts of the case can be described as follows.', '23.  On 11 August 1996 demonstrations occurred in the Dherynia area of Cyprus. Many of the demonstrators were Greek-Cypriot motorcyclists. At one of those demonstrations, which took place inside the UN buffer zone, a certain Anastasios Isaak was bludgeoned to death by persons who had entered the buffer zone in circumstances making Turkey responsible for that death.', '24.  The funeral of Anastasios Isaak took place on 14 August 1996 at 11 a.m. A crowd of 3,000 people attended the funeral, including about 100 motorcyclists. At about 1.47 p.m. around 700 demonstrators came into the southern side of the buffer zone area, following the funeral service. A group of demonstrators sought to enter the buffer zone in order to lay a wreath at the site of the killing, but was refused permission by the UN forces. The group forced its way past the UN barrier and went into the buffer zone near the site of Mr Isaak’s death. Around 200 to 400 demonstrators entered the buffer zone, but almost all were contained by the security forces. Some demonstrators had sticks or iron bars; one was seen to have a knife. No demonstrator had a firearm. Stones were thrown at the Turkish forces.', '25.  Solomos Solomou, who was unarmed and not carrying a stick, bar or other implement, broke through a line of UN personnel and ran towards the Turkish ceasefire line. He was chased by a member of UNFICYP, Mr Booth, who tried to prevent him from going further. Mr Solomou escaped Mr Booth’s grip. He then ran around the sentry box inside the Turkish ceasefire line. He started to climb a pole holding the Turkish flag which was positioned six metres behind the sentry box. When he was about 3 metres up the pole (less than one-quarter of the way to the top) he was shot and fell to the ground. He was hit by five bullets and died almost instantaneously.', '26.  The Turkish forces then opened fire indiscriminately. Four other persons (two UN personnel and two civilians) were wounded. From the balcony of the Turkish observation post (a two-storey house), Lieutenant General Hasan Kundakci (the Commander of the Turkish occupation forces), Major General Mehmet Karli (Commander of the 28th Turkish Division) and Attila Sav (the Chief of Police) were surveying the operations. Next to them was Kenan Akin, a minister in the “TRNC” administration.', '27.  According to the Cypriot Government, at least three persons from the Turkish side (two of whom were wearing Turkish military uniforms) fired directly at Solomos Solomou. Even if it was not possible to say who inflicted the fatal wound, each of them intended to kill him.', '28.  In support of their version of facts, the Government of Cyprus produced the following evidence: a pathological report, a ballistic report, photographs, a videotape and witnesses’ statements. Their content may be summarised as follows.', '29.  A forensic investigation established that: (a) Solomos Solomou had been struck by five bullets; (b) one bullet had entered his head behind the right ear, and exited to the left of the nose. The position of the firearm must have been above ground level at a point higher that the victim’s head and behind the victim. This was not the fatal bullet; (c) one bullet had entered the deceased’s body behind the left nipple and had come to rest by the right scapula. This wound was the direct cause of death; (d) another bullet had been recovered from below the skin of the middle of the back; it had entered by the upper left buttock; and (e) bullet fragments had been recovered from the right thigh. The forensic doctors came to the conclusion that the bullets had been fired with an intention to kill, that the first wound had been inflicted while the victim was climbing the flagpole and that the other bullet had hit him while he was falling or while he was lying on the ground.', '30.  The bullets and fragments recovered from Mr Solomou’s body were of 9 mm P calibre. This type of bullet is used by the Turkish-Cypriot forces and by the Turkish military forces.', '31.  One photograph showed Mr Solomou starting to climb the pole and with one foot still on the ground. A man in Turkish uniform (Mr Erdal Emanet, who was the Commander of the Special Forces of the Turkish-Cypriot police) was aiming his pistol at him. Other photographs and extracts from the videotape showed Mr Emanet levelling his pistol, cocking it and aiming it at Mr Solomou. Another man in civilian clothes (Mr Kenan Akin) was on the balcony of the Turkish observation post and had not yet drawn a weapon. In another picture, Mr Solomou had climbed about one metre up the flagpole and Mr Akin was aiming a pistol directly at him. The videotape showed a uniformed soldier, whose identity was not established, shooting directly at Mr Solomou with an automatic weapon (a rifle).', '32.  Numerous eyewitnesses (Nectarios Zalistis, Tasos Anastasiou, Floros Constanti and Kyriakis Pomilorides) declared that they had seen Mr Akin shooting at Mr Solomou from the balcony of the observation post. Other witnesses (Lance Bombardier Michael Sanders, Garda Pauroic O’Reilly, Garda Michael Fitzpatrick, Acting Sergeant Hayward, Photis Photiou, Nectarios Zalistis and Kyriakos Pomilorides) identified Mr Emanet as one of the shooters. The soldier with an automatic rifle was seen or heard firing at Mr Solomou by Sergeant Geoffrey Whiley, Acting Sergeant Brian Hayward, Georgios Aresti and Costas Charalambous.', '33.  The Government of Cyprus underlined that no witness had reported any warning being issued to the demonstrators by the Turkish forces either verbally or by warning shots. Nor was any warning apparent from the filmed footage.', '34.  On 26 August 1996, AUSTCIVPOL sought the assistance of the Turkish forces in providing information about the incident involving the killing of Solomos Solomou. A list of detailed questions was forwarded to the “TRNC” authorities. The Government of Cyprus were not aware of any answer given to these questions or of any investigation carried out by the “TNRC” authorities. The latter had denied access to the crime scene.', '35.  The Government of Cyprus furthermore drew the Court’s attention to the following statements and press articles.\\nAt the beginning of August 1996, Lieutenant-General Kundakci (the Commander in Chief of the Turkish Forces in Cyprus) declared to a local newspaper:\\n“No one can cross our borders by motorcycle. Those who try pay the price. What is necessary shall be done.\\nWithout permission it is not possible to cross the TRNC borders, either by motorcycles or by any other means, and if they come, of course we will not welcome them with flowers. If they want to try let them do so. Those who try pay the price.”\\nOn 7 August 1996 the Turkish-Cypriot newspaper Kibris reported that Turkish military sources had said:\\n“Our basic aim is to deter the Greek Cypriots from resorting to such provocations. However, if the Greek Cypriots insist on the action, then we will teach them a lesson so that they will never ever attempt such a thing again.”\\nOn 13 August 1996 the Turkish-Cypriot newspaper Halkin Sesi published the following declaration by Mrs Çiller, the Turkish Foreign Minister and Acting Prime Minister:\\n“If an attempt is made not to recognise the TRNC borders, we will do whatever is necessary. Those who attempt to cross over the border will be immediately pushed back and the legitimacy of our borders shall be re-established again.”\\nOn 15 August 1996 the Turkish-Cypriot newspaper Yeni Demokrat wrote:\\n“Lieutenant-General Kundakci has said that the Turkish side did not issue any invitation to anybody, and that it had no eyes on others’ territory. Against this, stressed Lieutenant-General Kundakci, ‘we do not let anybody with bad intentions enter our territory. Those who force their way in get their punishment. Everybody should know this.”\\nOn the same day, a recording by Mrs Çiller was played on Turkish television. It contained, inter alia, the following passage:\\n“The world should know that we will not allow anyone to raise his hand against the flag. We will break the hands that are raised against the flag. For us, this is a matter of honour.”', '36.  The Government of Cyprus also underlined the following passages of UNFICYP’s report on the events surrounding the demonstration of 14 August 1996:\\n“As a result of the indiscriminate shooting by Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot soldiers, two British UNFICYP soldiers were shot from behind and two Greek-Cypriot civilians were also hit by gunfire. Three were inside the buffer zone and one of the civilians, who sustained a serious gun shot wound to the abdomen, was standing outside the UN buffer zone close to the National Guard checkpoint.\\nThe Force Commander of UNFICYP accompanied by the Chief of Staff met with the Commander of the Turkish Forces in Cyprus late in the afternoon of 14 August to strongly protest the totally unwarranted use of force by Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot military personnel which resulted in the killing of Solomou and in injuries to two peace keepers and two civilians.”'], 'applicants': ['SOLOMOU', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['2', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['2'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['14', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '24', '31', '79', '84']}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24], 'explained_indices': [3, 1, 0, 4, 2, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 14, 15, 28, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 16, 29, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.2573822, 0.20833832, 0.09221083, 0.047940165, 0.014915705, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, 0.0018163323, -0.014857173], 'number_of_sentences': 30, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

In February 1995 the Social Council (socialnämnden) of Borgholm was contacted by a schoolteacher on account of a suspicion that one of her pupils, M., a boy born in June 1984 and thus at the time aged 10, had been sexually abused by the applicant. On 29 March 1995, having carried out an investigation, the Council reported the matter to the police authority in Kalmar.', \"10.  On 7 April 1995, between 10.09 a.m. and 10.51 a.m., M. was interviewed by the police. The interview was recorded on videotape. M.'s parents and representatives of the Social Council were present in the adjoining room. At that time, the applicant had not been informed of the suspicions against him and no defence counsel had been appointed for him.\\nThe interview was conducted by a detective inspector with twenty-six years of service in the police force. Since 1989 he had been working exclusively on investigations concerning ill-treatment and sexual abuse of children.\", '11.  On 10 May 1995 the applicant was questioned by the police and the public prosecutor. Before the questioning the applicant was notified, in accordance with Chapter 23, section 18, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (Rättegångsbalken), of the suspicions against him.', \"12.  In June 1995 the applicant received a copy of the report of the preliminary investigation and on 3 July defence counsel was appointed for him. The applicant was given an opportunity to submit observations and request additional interviews and other investigative measures. Finding that further information was necessary with regard to, inter alia, the dates and the number of occasions when the alleged acts had been committed and the sites at which they were supposed to have occurred, the applicant's counsel requested that M. be interviewed again.\", \"13.  In accordance with counsel's request, a second interview with M. was conducted on 20 September 1995, between 12.50 p.m. and 1.14 p.m. at the boy's home, by the same detective inspector. During the interview, which was recorded on audiotape only, M.'s parents were present but not the applicant's counsel. It appears that M.'s counsel, who had not been served notice of the interview, was opposed to counsel for only one of the parties being present at an interview. Finding that it would be unreasonable to cancel the interview, as the police officer was present and M. had taken time off from school, the applicant's counsel agreed that it could be conducted without his being present. The police officer and the applicant's counsel discussed what aspects of the case needed to be addressed during the interview. In general, counsel for the applicant wished to have a more detailed account of what was alleged to have happened. However, no written list of questions was drawn up. Counsel for the applicant later listened to the audiotape of the interview and was given a transcript of the tape. Finding that the issues raised in his request had been covered, he did not call for a further interview to be held.\", '14.  On 29 September 1995 the applicant was indicted for sexual acts with a child (sexuellt umgänge med barn).', \"15.  The Kalmar District Court (tingsrätten) heard the case on 31 October 1995. The applicant denied the charges. The videotaped police interview with M. was shown during the hearing. The record of the second interview was read out. The court also heard evidence from M.'s mother and his schoolteacher as witnesses. No request for M. to be heard in person was made.\", \"16.  In a judgment of 14 November 1995 the District Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to eight months' imprisonment. The court, noting that the outcome of the case was entirely dependent on the credibility of M.'s statements, found no reason to call into question their veracity. Thus, basing itself on those statements, the court found that the applicant, on a large number of occasions in 1994, had touched M.'s penis or masturbated him and induced M. to touch the applicant's penis or masturbate him.\", \"17.  The applicant appealed to the Göta Court of Appeal (Göta hovrätt). Subsequently, at the applicant's request, his defence counsel was replaced. The appellate court held a hearing on 22 April 1996, during which it heard the applicant and his new counsel. M.'s mother and his schoolteacher gave evidence. The videotape of the first police interview with M. and the audiotape of the second interview were played back. Again, the applicant did not request that M. give evidence during the hearing.\", \"18.  In a judgment of 6 May 1996 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's conviction but reduced the sentence to three months' imprisonment. It considered that, as there was no technical evidence in the case and nobody had witnessed the alleged acts, the credibility of M.'s statements was of decisive importance in determining the applicant's guilt. It went on to state the following:\\n“For reasons of legal certainty, the questioning of children during pre-trial investigations must – as explained in detail by the Supreme Court [Högsta domstolen] in NJA 1993 p. 616 – meet high standards with regard to both methods and content.\\nThe information given by [M.] is, in some parts, vague and uncertain. He has not been able to give details of any specific incident covered by the prosecution and he has been able to describe only in more general terms what kind of sexual contact has occurred. It should further be noted that some of the questions put to him have been of a leading nature. Even if these circumstances are taken into account, the Court of Appeal finds that [M.'s] statements cannot be disregarded.\\nA fact which strongly indicates that [M.] has been subjected to homosexual abuse is his expressed concern that he would become 'gay'. The Court of Appeal has had further regard to the following circumstances. The general impression of the video-recording is that [M.] has talked about something he has indeed experienced and that it has been embarrassing and painful for him to give this information. This may explain his unwillingness to go into detail about specific incidents. [M.] has not shown any tendency to exaggerate his statements and has corrected the interrogator on several occasions. Furthermore, in some respects his statements can be said to contain more personal observations, for example, 'Of course, I did not want to touch his but sometimes I did it without gloves' and 'First I asked if I would get any (refers to pastilles). He did not have any and then I did it voluntarily but I do not know why'. It should further be noted that no information has come to hand which could reasonably explain why [M.] would make untrue statements about events which he obviously considers to be shameful. Also of importance is the information given by [M.'s] mother and teacher which describes how [M.'s] personality has changed since the alleged injustice. The fact that it was a long time before [M.] spoke about what he experienced is easily explained by the feelings of guilt he has had and by the fact that thinking about the incidents is distasteful to him. [M.'s] accounts do not contain any improbable elements, neither is the information given by him contradicted by other statements. In view of what has now been said, the Court of Appeal finds that [M.] is credible and that his statements should form the basis for the Court of Appeal's assessment of whether [the applicant] has behaved towards him in the manner indicated by the public prosecutor in his statement on the charges.”\\nThe Court of Appeal found that the information given by M. showed that the applicant had induced M. to touch the applicant's penis or masturbate him. However, the statements that the applicant had touched M.'s penis or masturbated him were too uncertain and vague and thus did not constitute sufficient evidence.\", \"19.  The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court. Relying on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, he complained that his counsel had not been able to put questions to M. He noted that there was no technical or other evidence in the case to support M.'s statements. He further criticised the manner in which M. had been interviewed and stated that M.'s statements were vague and contradictory. In these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he had a right to cross-examine M. He maintained that the Supreme Court's case-law, which allegedly permitted the procedure followed in his case, had to be changed in order either to give counsel for the defence a right to examine the minor or to require clear supporting evidence.\", '20.

On 3 December 2003 the victim lodged his civil claim seeking damages in the amounts of 34,159,008 Armenian drams (AMD) and 119,000 United States dollars (USD).', \"14.  On 27 January 2004 the Malatia-Sebastia District Court of Yerevan found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven years in prison. The court also fully granted the victim's civil claim for damages. The court based its judgment on, inter alia, the statements of ten witnesses examined in court, including accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M, an act prepared by the tax authority specialists, two court-ordered accounting expert opinions, the statements of accounting experts V.A. and A.M., and a handwriting expert opinion.\", \"15.  On 10 February 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քրեական և զինվորական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան). The applicant also submitted written explanations concerning the civil claim, in which he requested the Court of Appeal to call and examine the victim's accountant S.H. as a witness. He also requested that accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M. be called for additional examination. He further asked to call three other persons, K., H. and Z. To substantiate his request to have accountants S.H. and K.S. called and examined, the applicant submitted to the court two accounting reports prepared by them which, according to him, contained exculpatory information.\", \"16.  On 19 March 2004 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal held its first hearing. In the courtroom the applicant was placed in a metal cage which measured about 3 sq. m. The applicant was represented by two defence counsel. At the hearing, the applicant's defence counsel filed a motion with the court, arguing that the applicant's placement in a metal cage in the presence of many people, including relatives and friends, amounted to degrading treatment and humiliated him. Furthermore, this violated the principle of equality of arms, because the applicant, being in a cage, was not able to feel equal to the other parties. The fact that the applicant was a detainee was not sufficient justification to keep him in a metal cage during the court hearings. Nor did the law on arrested and detained persons prescribe placement of a detainee in a metal cage in the courtroom. The defence counsel requested the court to release the applicant from the cage and to allow him to be seated in the seats meant for the parties, namely next to his lawyer.\", \"17.  The prosecutor objected to this motion, claiming that the law on arrested and detained persons said nothing about a defendant being released from the metal cage. Besides, the defendant was to be seated in the seat meant for him and that could not be regarded as violating his dignity. The victim's representative also objected to this motion, claiming that the applicant was a detainee, therefore he had to be kept in a metal cage. Furthermore, there were no requisite security measures in the courtroom.\", '18.  The Court of Appeal decided to refuse this motion as unsubstantiated, finding that the placement of the defendant in the seat meant for him during the court hearings did not violate the rights invoked by the defence. The court further stated that its decision was based on security considerations.', \"19.  During the entire proceedings before the Court of Appeal the applicant was kept in the metal cage. The proceedings lasted about two months and included at least twelve public hearings. According to the applicant, the hearings lasted on average about four hours. It appears that they were attended by the applicant's children, wife, siblings and friends, and other members of the public.\", '20.  At the hearing of 21 May 2004 the applicant repeated his request to call witnesses, made earlier in his written explanations. The Court of Appeal refused this request on the ground that accountant K.S. and treasurer K.M. had already been examined and made detailed statements during the investigation and the proceedings in the District Court. As to the accountant S.H., the court stated that it was unnecessary to call her in this particular case. As to K., H. and Z., the court stated that their identity was unknown.', \"21.  On 25 May 2004 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's sentence. The Court of Appeal only partially granted the victim's civil claim, awarding him AMD 23,063,108 and USD 119,000.\", '22.  On 4 June 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.', \"23.  On 30 July 2004 the Court of Cassation (ՀՀ վճռաբեկ դատարան) dismissed the appeal and upheld the applicant's conviction.\", '24.  It appears that, prior to his placement in detention, the applicant suffered from a number of diseases, including acute bleeding duodenal ulcer and diabetes. It further appears that he had suffered a heart attack in 2001.', '25.  On 6 May 2003 the applicant was placed in Nubarashen Detention Facility («Նուբարաշեն» քրեակատարողական հիմնարկ).', '26.  On 7 May 2003 the applicant was examined by a doctor upon his admission to the detention facility. It was noted that he suffered from ischemic heart disease, gallstones and diabetes.', \"27.  On 20 June 2003 the applicant was examined by a surgeon of the facility's medical unit to whom he complained of pain in the epigastric region which worsened at night and improved after eating. He further complained of loss of weight and frequent vomiting. The surgeon noted that the applicant, prior to his detention, had been diagnosed with an acute bleeding duodenal ulcer and recommended to have surgery. The applicant agreed in writing to have surgery.\", \"28.  On 26 June 2003 the applicant was transferred to the Hospital for Prisoners («Դատապարտյալների հիվանդանոց» քրեակատարողական հիմնարկ). According to the applicant's treatment plan, developed upon his admission, the applicant was supposed to undergo blood and urine tests, an electrocardiogram, a gastroscopy, and consultations with a cardiologist and an endocrinologist.\", \"29.  It appears from the applicant's hospital medical file that the applicant was under regular medical observation.\", '30.  On 27 and 28 June 2003 blood and urine tests were carried out.', '31.  On 30 June and 4 July 2003 an endoscopy and a gastroscopy were performed. The diagnosis of an acute, bleeding duodenal ulcer was confirmed. It appears that on the latter date the applicant also underwent haemostatic treatment of the ulcer.', '32.  On 3 July 2003 the applicant underwent an ultrasound scan of his abdominal area and urinary organs.', \"33.  On 7 July 2003 the applicant's gastrointestinal problems exacerbated, causing him to feel dizzy and to collapse. Medical aid was provided.\", \"34.  By a letter of 8 July 2003 the chief of the Hospital for Prisoners informed the judge examining the applicant's case that the applicant had been admitted to the hospital as an emergency case and had been diagnosed with an acute bleeding duodenal ulcer. On 4 July 2003 a gastroscopy had been performed, accompanied by haemostatic therapy. The applicant continued to receive treatment and for the time being was unfit for trial.\", '35.  On 11 July 2003 an electrocardiogram was performed.', \"36.  On 23 July 2003 the applicant was examined by an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist recommended an additional glycaemia test on an empty stomach in order to decide on the applicant's further treatment.\", '37.  On 29 July 2003 the applicant was discharged from the hospital and transferred back to the detention facility. According to the relevant discharge certificate (էպիկրիզ) issued by the Chief of the Hospital, M.G., and the Head of the Surgical Unit, A.D.:\\n“Following the relevant examination and consultations carried out in the unit, [the applicant] was diagnosed as having an ulcer, acute bleeding duodenal ulcer, diabetes (type 2, medium degree, subcompensated stage) and diabetic angiopathy, for which, apart from the relevant treatment, on 4 July 2003 [the applicant] received haemostatic therapy of the ulcer and was discharged on 29 July 2003. The patient must undergo regular medical check-ups.”', \"38.  On the same date it was noted in the applicant's medical file that he was being discharged after receiving appropriate treatment and was in satisfactory condition.\", '39.  The Government alleged that the applicant had also undergone the recommended surgery at the hospital. The applicant contested this allegation and claimed that no surgery had been carried out.', '40.  On 5 August 2003 the applicant was transferred to the medical unit of the detention facility for further treatment since his state of health had deteriorated. At the medical unit, the applicant was examined by a doctor to whom he complained of, inter alia, pain in his chest, dry mouth, asthenia, headache, dizziness and occasional vomiting. Blood and urine tests were carried out.', '41.  From 11 to 29 August 2003, according to the records made in his medical file, the applicant was under regular medical observation and received medication. Regular check-ups were performed once every two to three days. His state of health during this period was recorded as fluctuating between stable and deteriorated.', \"42.  On 14 August 2003 an ambulance was called to the courtroom since the applicant's heart condition worsened. He was examined by a cardiologist and diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, post-infarction cardiosclerosis and rest stenocardia. An electrocardiogram was prescribed as well as medication including validol, analgin and dimedrol.\", \"43.  On 22 August 2003 an ambulance was called to the courtroom for the same reasons. The applicant's heart diagnosis was confirmed and in-patient examination and treatment were recommended.\", \"44.  By a letter of 22 August 2003 the examining judge informed the chief of the detention facility about the events of 14 and 22 August 2003 and inquired about the applicant's state of health and whether he was receiving requisite medical assistance.\", '45.  By a letter of 28 August 2003 the chief of the detention facility informed the judge that the applicant was suffering from ischemic heart disease, exertion and rest stenocardia, post-infarction cardiosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic angiopathy and bleeding duodenal ulcer. The letter further stated that the applicant was under constant medical observation and was receiving treatment.', \"46.  On 9 September 2003 the applicant's counsel applied to the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department of the Ministry of Justice (ՀՀ արդարադատության նախարարության քրեակատարողական վարչության պետ), stating that the applicant's state of health required regular medical check-ups and requesting his transfer to the Hospital for Prisoners for treatment. It appears that no reply to this complaint was received\", '47.  On 13 October 2003 the applicant was transferred from the medical unit back to his cell.', '48.  The applicant alleged that from the date of his transfer to his cell in the detention facility until his transfer to a correctional facility on 13 August 2004 he was never examined by a doctor. He had verbally applied on numerous occasions to the administration of the detention facility requesting medical assistance, but no such assistance or medication had been provided, nor any special diet prescribed. The necessary medicines and food products were provided by his relatives on a regular basis.', \"49.  The Government confirmed that the applicant had verbally applied to the administration of the detention facility for medical assistance within the above-mentioned period, but alleged that such assistance had been provided to the applicant on each and every occasion, including necessary medicines and diet. He was regularly checked by a doctor and, if any symptoms were disclosed, he promptly received the necessary treatment. The detention facility was staffed with the following specialists: two physicians, one psychiatrist-neurologist, one dermatologist, one dentist, one tuberculosis specialist, one laboratory assistant and six doctors' assistants. The latter visited the detainees every day to check their health and the doctors were immediately alerted if there were any problems.\", '50.  In support of this allegation the Government submitted a statement made on 27 June 2006 by the Principal Specialist of the Medical Assistance Unit of the Criminal Corrections Department of the Ministry of Justice, A.H. According to this statement, between October 2003 and August 2004 the applicant had regularly applied to the medical staff of the detention facility and had received medical consultations and out-patient treatment for ischemic heart disease, exertion and rest stenocardia, diabetes and duodenal ulcer. Medication was prescribed, including solution of analgin, papaverin, dibazol, phurosemid, validol, ranitidine, nitrong and diabeton, which the detention facility received on a quarterly basis from the Hospital for Prisoners.', '51.  On 18 December 2003 the applicant underwent an ultrasound scan of his abdominal area by an outside doctor invited by his relatives.', '52.  On 9 February 2004, as it appears from the relevant certificate, the applicant was found to be fit for work after being examined by a doctor.', \"53.  The court hearing scheduled for 13 April 2004 was adjourned because of the applicant's poor health.\", \"54.  On 17 June 2004 the applicant's counsel applied to the Chief of Nubarashen Detention Facility, complaining that it was dangerous for the applicant, in view of his health, to be kept in a common cell. He further complained that, in spite of this, the applicant had recently been transferred to another cell where conditions were even worse. Counsel requested that the applicant be urgently transferred to a hospital for treatment.\", \"55.  On 17 July 2004 the applicant's counsel applied to the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department of the Ministry of Justice, complaining that, notwithstanding the applicant's state of health, he was kept in a common cell. He further complained that the Chief of Nubarashen Detention Facility had failed to transfer the applicant to a hospital and to provide treatment.\", '56.  On 27 July 2004 at 1.20 a.m. an ambulance was called to the detention facility because the applicant suffered a heart attack.', \"57.  On 28 July 2004 the applicant's counsel lodged a similar complaint to that of 17 July 2004, with a copy to the Chief of Nubarashen Detention Facility.\", \"58.  By a letter of 29 July 2004 the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department replied to counsel's complaint of 17 July 2004, stating that the applicant had already been hospitalised twice for treatment from 26 June to 29 July 2003 and from 5 August to 13 October 2003. The letter further stated that the applicant was currently under observation by the medical staff and his state of health was satisfactory.\", \"59.  On 11 and 12 August 2004 the applicant's counsel lodged two complaints with the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department and with the Minister of Justice, with a copy to the Chief of Nubarashen Detention Facility, claiming that the applicant's state of health was deteriorating daily, but no measures were being taken. He submitted that the applicant's illnesses required a special diet, regular medical check-ups and medication. In spite of this, the applicant was kept in conditions where none of this was available.\", \"60.  By a letter of 13 August 2004 the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department replied to the counsel's complaint of 28 July 2004, stating that the letter of 29 July 2004 had already answered the issues raised.\", '61.  On 13 August 2004, after his conviction was upheld in the final instance, the applicant was transferred to Kosh correctional facility to serve his sentence.', '62.  On 14 August 2004 the applicant was examined by a doctor upon his admission to the correctional facility. He complained of asthenia, dizziness and of pain in his epigastric area and the left part of his back. His general state of health was found to be satisfactory. Medication was prescribed.', \"63.  By a letter of 20 August 2004 the Head of the Criminal Corrections Department replied to the counsel's complaint of 12 August 2004, stating that the applicant had more than once received treatment in various facilities and that he was currently serving his sentence at Kosh correctional facility where his state of health was found to be satisfactory.\", \"64.  On 29 December 2006 the Aragatsotn Regional Court (Արագածոտն մարզի առաջին ատյանի դատարան) dismissed the applicant's request to be released on parole, finding that he was not entitled under the law to lodge such a request directly with the courts without the prior approval by the parole board.\", '65.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal.', \"66.  On 14 March 2007 the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal reviewed the decision of the Regional Court and decided to examine and grant the applicant's request for release in view of his good behaviour.\", '67.  This decision, though subject to appeal on points of law, was immediately enforceable, so the applicant was released from prison.', \"68.  On 1 June 2007 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the Court of Appeal upon the prosecutor's appeal and decided to terminate the proceedings on the same ground as the Regional Court.\", '69.  The applicant was taken back to prison.', '70.

The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Lereşti.', '8.  On 5 November 1992 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having murdered his father.', '9.  By a judgment delivered by the Argeş County Court on 24 September 1993, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to twenty‑seven years’ imprisonment.', '10.  He served his sentence mainly in Colibaşi Prison.', '11.  On 14 December 2005 he was released from prison.', '12.  On 3 December 1998 prison guards S.N. and L.D. carried out a search in the applicant’s cell following his self-intoxication with medicines.', '13.  As stated in the prosecutor’s decision of 29 June 1999, on 9 December 1998 the applicant claimed that certain personal objects had been stolen. Prison guards S.N. and L.D went into his cell. The applicant accused them of stealing four boxes of coffee during the search. As he became aggressive, prison guard S.N. immobilised and repeatedly hit him with a truncheon in order to calm him down. However, instead of calming down he became more aggressive, so he was handcuffed and taken to cell no. 57. This version of events was not contested by the applicant.', '14.  On the same day, prison guard S.N. drafted a report stating that he had been forced to use a truncheon against the applicant because of his aggressive behaviour.', '15.  On 17 December 1998 the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Argeş Forensic Laboratory. The forensic report drafted after the examination stated that the applicant had been hit with a hard object, probably on 9 December 1998, causing him injuries that needed eight or nine days of medical treatment. It noted the existence of an ecchymosed yellow‑purplish zone on his hip and his left thigh, as well as a one‑centimetre‑long scratch on his left fist. As a result of the aggression, his tympanum was broken.', '16.  On 23 December 1998 the applicant filed a criminal complaint concerning the incident with the Bucharest Military Prosecutor’s Office (Parchetul Militar Bucureşti).', '17.  The chief doctor of Colibaşi prison gave a statement on 13 January 1999. He stated that the applicant had been involved in the incident of 9 December 1998 because of his mental illness. The applicant and S.N. were questioned on 19 January 1999.', '18.  On 14 June 1999 a criminal investigation was initiated against prison guard S.N. for abusive behaviour.', '19.  Two of the applicant’s co-detainees were heard by the investigating prosecutor. They stated that the applicant had been repeatedly hit by prison guard S. N. Two other prison guards stated that the use of force by their colleague S.N. had been brought on by the applicant’s violent behaviour.', '20.  In his written statement, S.N. admitted that he had used the truncheon with excessive force to calm the applicant down, without previously trying to use other means.', '21.  On 29 June 1999 the military prosecutor decided to discontinue the investigation against prison guard S.N. and ordered him to pay an administrative fine amounting to one million Romanian lei (“RON”), equivalent to 30 United States Dollars (“USD”). The decision referred to the applicant’s medical condition and noted that agent S.N. had used the truncheon with excessive force and broken the applicant’s tympanum. However, taking into account the specificity of S.N.’s activity as a prison guard and the need to solve difficult situations in prison, it found that the acts committed by S.N. could not be classified as an offence.', '22.  According to the applicant, the military prosecutor’s decision was never communicated to him. Although the Government contended that the decision was communicated to the applicant they did not submit any evidence in this respect.', '23.  As the applicant did not receive any reply from the military prosecutor, on 23 February 2000 he sent a letter to the chief military prosecutor making reference to the incident of 9 December 1998 and asking for a criminal investigation against prison guard S.N. It appears from the file that the applicant did not receive any reply to this letter.', '24.  When the applicant was arrested in 1992, he was diagnosed with unstable personality disorder.', '25.  The expert report drafted by Argeş Forensic Laboratory on 9 November 1995 concluded that the applicant suffered from polymorphic psychopathy and loss of discernment. It recommended the applicant’s hospitalisation in a psychiatric establishment, in accordance with Article 114 of the Criminal Code. Based on the conclusions of that report, the applicant was granted a suspension of the execution of his punishment for the period between 28 February and 8 August 1996.', '26.  Another expert report drafted by the same forensic laboratory on 24 July 1997 stated that the applicant suffered from the same disease – polymorphic psychopathy – and concluded that he needed to be under the supervision of a psychiatric unit belonging to the prison sanitary network.', '27.  Four months later an expert report drafted by the Bucharest Forensic Institute concluded that the applicant suffered from sociopathy, and that he could be treated in the prison medical network.', '28.  Two other reports, drafted on 17 September and 20 November 1998, stated that the applicant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and recommended his admission to a specialised psychiatric unit in the prison network for supervision and treatment.', '29.  A new expert report, drafted on 5 April 1999, recommended his hospitalisation in Poiana Mare psychiatric hospital. Consequently, the applicant lodged a request for a stay of execution of his prison sentence. On 11 May 1999 his request was dismissed by the Argeş County Court on the ground that the report had not stated that the applicant’s medical condition could not be treated in the prison hospital.', '30.  Two subsequent reports, drafted on 14 March 2001 and 26 March 2002 respectively, stated that the applicant had been diagnosed with pyloric stenosis (a complication of a duodenal ulcer, characterised by the stricture of the pyloric canal and manifested by vomiting after each meal) and dyspeptic ulcer syndrome (ulcer syndrome characterised by epigastric pains and burning sensations). They recommended the medical treatment offered by the prison hospitals.', '31.  A report prepared by the hospital of Colibaşi prison on 21 May 2004 stated that the applicant had served a large part of his prison sentence in the prison’s hospital. Moreover, from the analysis of the documents submitted by the Government it appears that the applicant was hospitalised in the Bucharest prison hospital:\\n-between 16 November and 4 December 1992, on the ground that he suffered from a personality disorder;\\n-between 1 November and 2 December 1997, for examination by a psychiatric doctor because he was refusing to eat;\\n-between 20 March and 7 April 1998, for treatment of his polymorphic psychopathy;\\n-between 16 and 24 April 1998, for refusing to eat and for treatment of his polymorphic psychopathy;\\n-between 19 August and 19 October 1999 because he had been diagnosed with Gausser syndrome;\\n-between 6 July and 10 July 2000 because he was in a coma and had a high fever;\\n-between 29 March and 17 April 2002 and between 19 July and 7 August 2002, for treatment of his polymorphic psychopathy;\\n-between 29 June and 7 July 2004 for treatment of his duodenal ulcer, polymorphic psychopathy and lumbar discopathy;\\n-and between 21 October and 2 November 2005, for obesity and insufficiency of peripheral circulation.', '32.  Furthermore, in 2000 the applicant was hospitalised three times in the Colibaşi prison hospital for treatment of his chronic gastric ulcer. In 2002 he was again hospitalised in the same hospital for treatment of his pyloric stenosis.', '33.  The applicant refused to eat on seven occasions.', '34.  According to the information submitted by the applicant, he was of Baptist confession. While in detention, he had attended a Baptist seminar at the “Source of Light-Europe” Institute.', '35.  On 29 November 2002 P.G., the general manager of the national civil assistance centre for prisons “Hope for the Future” (Speranţa pentru viitor), addressed a letter to the Colibaşi prison authorities stating that the applicant had been monitored by their advice and social reintegration service. The manager expressed his concern about the confiscation by the prison authorities of a small radio-cassette player awarded to the applicant for good results obtained while attending the “Christian moral education” programme.', '36.  By a letter dated 24 December 2002 the prison management informed the applicant that according to the applicable law prisoners only had the right to have battery-operated radios and television sets. They added that, on request, he could listen to his audio cassettes on the cassette player belonging to the prison’s cultural and education department.', '37.  On 20 November 2002 the applicant informed the Registry of the Court that he had sent two letters for which he had not received any acknowledgement of receipt. He expressed suspicion that the prison staff were obstructing his right of recourse to the Court. He specified that one of the letters contained photocopies of the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court of Justice and the criminal complaints filed against the prison authorities.', '38.  On 22 January 2004 the applicant asked the prison authorities to provide him with photocopies of the documents requested by the Court. He enclosed the letters sent by the Court’s Registry on 1 and 9 December 2003.', '39.  In 1996 the applicant had been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for a minor offence. For the same offence he had been ordered to pay a fine of RON 100,000 (equivalent to USD 3). As he had executed both punishments he lodged a request for the return of the sum paid as a fine.', '40.  By a final decision of 22 April 1997, the Câmpulung District Court allowed his request and ordered the return of the money.', '41.  According to the applicant, on 4 June 2003 he lodged a request for the enforcement of the decision of 22 April 1997.', '42.  By a decision of 8 February 2001 the Argeş District Court pronounced the divorce of the applicant and his wife and awarded custody of their two minor children to the paternal grandmother. It also ordered the mother to pay a monthly sum towards the children’s maintenance.', '43.  The applicant alleged that on 12 February 2004 he had lodged a criminal complaint against his former wife for failure to pay the monthly allowance, but had received no reply from the authorities. He also complained about the passivity of the authorities in enforcing that decision.', '44.  On 3 January 2000 the applicant lodged a civil action for the partition of the inheritance left by his father. By a decision of 10 December 2001 the Câmpulung District Court allowed his action in part, allocating him a house and other movable assets.', '45.  The applicant lodged a request for the enforcement of the decision. By a letter dated 28 March 2003, the bailiff M. informed him that he had to pay the enforcement fees. According to information supplied by the Government, the applicant had submitted a new request for the enforcement of the decision in January 2006.

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Shumen. At the relevant time he was an officer in the Bulgarian Army.', '6.  On an unspecified date in 1989‑91 he was charged with stealing instruments and technical equipment belonging to individuals with whom he was acquainted. On 30 July 1991 he was indicted.', \"7.  On 28 October 1991 he was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended.\", '8.  On 30 October 1991 the former Supreme Court (Върховен съд) quashed his conviction and sentence and referred the case back to the prosecuting authorities for additional investigation (реш. № 360 от 30 декември 1991 г. по н. д. № 369/1991 г., ВС, военна колегия).', '9.  It seems that the case remained dormant until 2001.', '10.  On 6 June 2001, following a request by the prosecuting authorities, the migration authorities decided to prohibit the applicant from leaving the territory of Bulgaria and requested that he surrender his international passport. They relied on section 75(3) of the 1998 Bulgarian Identity Papers Act (see paragraph 24 below). On 22 August 2001 the applicant surrendered his passport. He did not seek judicial review of the decision.', \"11.  After that the applicant was indicted and put on trial. On 20 March 2002 the Varna Military Court (Варненски военен съд) found him guilty of theft and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment, suspended for four years. It noted that the stolen items had been found in the applicant's cellar and recognised by their owners, and held that the applicant's assertion that he had bought the items was not credible. Lastly, the court found that even though the applicant had been on night duty at the time when one of the thefts had been committed, he did not have an alibi, because his barracks were close to the building where the theft had taken place, he had come to work by car, and had not been seen by his colleagues for several hours.\", '12.  On an appeal by the applicant, on 5 June 2002 the Military Court of Appeal (Военноапелативен съд) reversed the Varna Military Court judgment and acquitted the applicant.', '13.  On an appeal by the prosecution, on 10 February 2003 the Supreme Court of Cassation (Върховен касационен съд) quashed the Military Court of Appeal judgment and remitted the case (реш. № 636 от 10 февруари 2003 г. по н. д. № 546/2002 г., ВКС, II н. о.).', \"14.  On 20 April 2003 the Military Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's conviction and sentence.\", \"15.  On an appeal by the applicant, on 23 February 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Military Court of Appeal judgment (реш. № 42 от 23 февруари 2004 г. по н. д. № 657/2003 г., ВКС, I н. о.). It noted that all the applicant's evidentiary requests had been allowed and that the charges against him had been sufficiently established on the basis of the available evidence.\", \"16.  On 13 October 2004 the Shumen Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs, having received the applicant's criminal record, decided to take away his international passport until he had been rehabilitated. It relied on section 76(2) of the 1998 Bulgarian Identity Papers Act (see paragraph 25 below). The applicant did not seek judicial review of the decision.\", '17.  Article 35 § 1 of the 1991 Constitution provides that “[e]veryone shall have the right to ... leave the country” and that this right “may be subject to restrictions provided for by act of Parliament, in the interest of national security, for the protection of public health and the rights and freedoms of others.”', '18.  An amendment to the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure that entered into force in June 2003 introduced the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial if the investigation had not been completed within two years in cases concerning serious offences and one year in all other cases (new Article 239a). On 29 April 2006 it was superseded by similarly worded provisions, Articles 368 and 369 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure, which were, however, repealed with effect from 28 May 2010. In a decision of 28 September 2010 (реш. № 10 от 28 септември 2010 г., по к. д. № 10/ 2010 г., обн., ДВ, бр. 80 от 12 октомври 2010 г.) the Constitutional Court rejected a challenge to the repealing legislation.', \"19.  In October 1994 a new provision, Article 147 § 3, was added to the 1974 Code. Under that Article, the imposition of preventive measures, such as detention, house arrest or bail, on individuals charged with an offence punishable by more than three years' imprisonment automatically triggered a prohibition on their leaving Bulgaria. Under Article 146 § 1 of the Code, at least one of the above preventive measures had to be imposed on any person charged with a publicly prosecutable offence.\", \"20.  On 1 January 2000 Article 147 § 3 was repealed and replaced by the new Article 153a. It provided, in paragraph 1, that the public prosecutor could prohibit an individual accused of an offence committed with intent and punishable by imprisonment to leave Bulgaria without permission. Under Article 153a § 2, the prosecutor had to rule on a request for such permission within three days of its lodging. His or her refusal to grant permission was subject to judicial review (Article 153a § 3). The court had to examine the application in private and rule immediately by means of a final decision (Article 153a § 4). At the trial stage, the prosecutor's powers in that respect were taken over by the trial court (Article 153a § 5). The Supreme Court of Cassation has held that a trial court's decisions under Article 153a § 5 are subject to appeal to a higher court (реш. № 129 от 8 май 2003 г. по н. д. № 780/2002 г., ВКС, I н. о.).\", \"21.  On 29 April 2006 Article 153a of the 1972 Code was superseded by Article 68 of the 2005 Code. It repeats its text almost verbatim, but also provides, in paragraph 5, that the court may, in addition to quashing the prosecutor's refusal to grant permission for travel, set aside the travel ban as a whole, provided that there is no risk of the accused fleeing abroad. Paragraph 6 specifies that the court's decisions on such matters during the trial stage are subject to appeal to a higher court.\", '22.  Article 6 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, which came into force on 12 July 2006, provides that an administrative decision and its enforcement must not infringe rights and legitimate interests more than the minimum necessary for achieving the aim sought to be realised. Article 6 § 5 provides that administrative authorities must refrain from acting in a way that causes damage which is out of proportion to the aim sought to be realised.', \"23.  Section 33(1) of the 1998 Bulgarian Identity Papers Act (Закон за българските документи за самоличност) (in October 2009 the Act's title was changed to Bulgarian Personal Papers Act – Закон за българските лични документи) (“the 1998 Act”) provides that any Bulgarian citizen has the right to leave the country and return to it with a passport or an equivalent document. Under section 33(3), that right cannot be subject to restrictions unless they are provided for by law and are necessary for the protection of national security, public order, health, or the rights and freedoms of others.\", \"24.  Section 75(3) of the Act, as in force until October 2009, provided that individuals the prosecuting authorities had barred from travelling abroad could not leave the country and were to have their international passports taken away. The Supreme Administrative Court has consistently held that the prosecuting authorities' decision to impose a travel ban was binding on the migration authorities and that the proper way of challenging such a ban was to seek permission to travel under Article 153a § 2 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 above); the granting of such permission would constitute grounds for the migration authorities to allow the person concerned to travel (реш. № 8385 от 29 декември 2000 г. по адм. д. № 3483/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 6134 от 25 юли 2001 г. по адм. д. № 3226/2001 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 805 от 30 януари 2002 г. по адм. д. № 8371/2001 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 4275 от 30 април 2002 г. по адм. д. № 2556/2002 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 10796 от 29 ноември 2002 г. по адм. д. № 4904/2002 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 11074 от 9 декември 2002 г. по адм. д. № 8178/2002 г., ВАС, петчленен състав; реш. № 37 от 6 януари 2003 г. по адм. д. № 9139/2002 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 2397 от 7 март 2006 г. по адм. д. № 9311/2005 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 11764 от 27 ноември 2006 г. по адм. д. № 5838/2006 г., ВАС, V о.).\", '25.  Section 76(2) of the Act provided that a Bulgarian national who had been convicted of a wilful publicly prosecutable offence and had not been rehabilitated (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below) could be barred from leaving the country and have his or her international passport taken away. On 1 October 2009 Parliament repealed it, on the basis of a bill introduced by the Council of Ministers on 21 August 2009. The explanatory notes to the bill made reference to Directive 2004/38/EC (see paragraph 28 below). The repealing Act came into force on 20 October 2009. In its ensuing case‑law the Supreme Administrative Court held that the repeal did not automatically invalidate travel bans imposed before it had come into force (реш. № 13819 от 17 ноември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 6999/2007 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 15106 от 10 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 7052/2009 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 10449 от 13 август 2010 г. по адм. д. № 1609/2010 г., ВАС, VІІ о.). The matter was settled with the adoption of paragraph 5 of the transitional and concluding provisions of an Act for the Amendment of the 1998 Act. It came into force on 10 April 2010 and specified that within three months of its entry into force all measures imposed under section 76(2) would cease to have effect.', \"26.  Decisions under the above provisions were subject to judicial review (section 79). In its almost constant case‑law under section 76(2) between 2000 and 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court held that the courts did not have jurisdiction to review the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for such measures, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (реш. № 7074 от 22 ноември 2000 г. по адм. д. № 1067/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 4244 от 29 юни 2000 г. по адм. д. № 2634/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 4987 от 20 юли 2000 г. по адм. д. № 2922/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 7727 от 17 октомври 2001 г. по адм. д. № 1760/2001 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 5030 от 29 юни 2001 г. по адм. д. № 3512/2001 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 7172 от 28 септември 2001 г. по адм. д. № 7968/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 9375 от 7 декември 2001 г. по адм. д. № 6604/2001 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 9663 от 31 октомври 2002 г. по адм. д. № 4315/2002 г., ВАС, петчленен състав; реш. № 10819 от 2 декември 2002 г. по адм. д. № 6100/2002 г., ВАС V о.; реш. № 4086 от 24 април 2003 г. по адм. д. № 1587/2003 г., ВАС, петчленен състав; реш. № 8729 от 2 октомври 2003 г. по адм. д. № 4354/2003 г., ВАС, петчленен състав; реш. № 6360 от 6 юли 2004 г. по адм. д. № 10646/2003 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 3167 от 11 април 2005 г. по адм. д. № 8361/2004 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 9883 от 11 ноември 2005 г. по адм. д. № 3562/2005 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 1203 от 1 февруари 2006 г. по адм. д. № 7226/2005 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 7840 от 12 юли 2006 г. по адм. д. № 1722/2006 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 5721 от 6 юни 2007 г. по адм. д. № 2389/2007 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 11504 от 21 ноември 2007 г. по адм. д. № 8005/2007 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 435 от 14 януари 2008 г. по адм. д. № 9455/2007 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 11568 от 3 ноември 2008 г. по адм. д. № 8430/2008 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 7099 от 1 юни 2009 г. по адм. д. № 14157/2008 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 15106 от 10 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 7052/2009 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 16059 от 28 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 7840/2009 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 16147 от 29 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 7284/2009 г., ВАС, V о.; реш. № 5535 от 28 април 2010 г. по адм. д. № 16321/2009 г., ВАС, VІІ о.; реш. № 8688 от 25 юни 2010 г. по адм. д. № 939/2010 г., ВАС, VІІ о.). In two judgments in 2000 and 2001 the Supreme Administrative held that, while having discretion in the matter, the authorities could not just rely on the fact of the conviction, but had to in addition give specific reasons for their decision to prohibit the persons concerned from leaving the country (реш. № 4488 от 7 юли 2000 г. по адм. д. № 2613/2000 г., ВАС, ІІІ о.; реш. № 8727 от 20 ноември 2001 г. по адм. д. № 6533/2001 г., ВАС, петчленен състав). Very recently, in August 2010, in a case in which the majority of the panel examining a case maintained the view that the authorities' discretion to impose such measures was unreviewable, a judge dissented, saying that in view of the requirements of Directive 2004/38/EC (see paragraph 28 below), such measures should be subjected to a strict proportionality assessment, in line with the principles developed by the European Court of Justice. She also expressed the opinion that section 76(2) ran counter to Article 27 of that Directive (реш. № 10449 от 13 август 2010 г. по адм. д. № 1609/2010 г., ВАС, VІІ о., особено мнение на съдия С. Янкулова).\", '27.  In the end of 2006 Parliament added two new subsections to section 23 of the 1998 Act. They came into force on 1 January 2007, the date of accession of Bulgaria to the European Union. New subsection 2 provides that every Bulgarian citizen has the right to leave the country to travel to another Member State with an identity card. Under subsection 3, that right is not subject to restrictions other than those provided for by law in the interests of national security, public safety, public order, the protection of health, or the rights and freedoms of others. In a judgment of 9 March 2009 (реш. № 3116 от 9 март 2009 г. по адм. д. № 10475/ 2008 г., ВАС, V о.), the Supreme Administrative Court overruled a lower court, which had held that, to impose a travel ban under section 76(2) of the Act (see paragraph 25 above), the authorities had to provide a specific justification meeting the requirements of section 23(3), which reflected those of Article 27 § 1 of Directive 2004/38/EC (see paragraph 28 below). The Supreme Administrative Court held that the two prerequisites laid down in section 76(2) amounted to sufficient justification for the purposes of section 23(3).', '28.  The chief instrument currently governing the free movement within the European Union of individuals who are nationals of a member State is Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. Article 27 of the Directive provides, in so far as relevant:\\n“1.  Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of nationality, on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. These grounds shall not be invoked to serve economic ends. 2.  Measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned. Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures.\\nThe personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted. ...”', '29.  In a judgment of 24 March 2010 (реш. № 3909 от 24 март 2010 г. по адм. д. № 13704/2009 г., ВАС, VІІ о.) the Supreme Administrative Court held that a travel ban imposed under section 76(3) of the 1998 Act – which provided that individuals who owed judicially established debts of more than a certain amount could be barred from leaving the country – was in breach of the above provision, which, in spite of not being transposed at the time of the ban, was directly applicable in Bulgaria and had precedence over domestic‑law rules which ran against it.', '30.  Under Article 86 § 1 (1) of the 1968 Criminal Code, an individual who has been given a suspended sentence and does not commit another offence during the probationary period is automatically rehabilitated. However, automatic rehabilitation is not possible if the person concerned has already been rehabilitated for an offence committed during adulthood (Article 86 § 2).', '31.  Apart from automatic rehabilitation, a convicted individual can benefit from judicial rehabilitation. Such rehabilitation may be granted by the court which convicted him or her, if the sentence has been served more than three years previously and the individual concerned has not committed another offence punishable with imprisonment, has shown good behaviour and, in the case of offences committed with intent, has made good any damage done (Article 87 § 1).

The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Lipcani.', '7.  After divorcing her husband more than twenty-two years prior to the relevant events, the applicant was living in her own house next to that belonging to her former husband, A.M. On 31 December 2009 A.M. broke into her house and beat her up. He did the same on 19 February 2010, since which date he has remained in the applicant’s house permanently, while the applicant has occasionally sought refuge with her neighbours.', '8.  The applicant obtained a medical report confirming that she had been beaten up on 19 February 2010. The applicant and her lawyer have made numerous complaints to the local police, the prosecutor’s office and other authorities, asking for protection for the applicant and for A.M. to be punished. The first such complaint was made on 18 March 2010 and was addressed to the local police. She also complained to other authorities that the local police had been aware of the situation but had done nothing to protect her.', '9.  On 27 March 2010 the applicant was again beaten up by A.M. On 30 March 2010 the local police informed her that the events complained of had been confirmed, but that A.M. could not be punished as he was mentally ill.', '10.  On 9 June 2010 the Ocniţa police instituted criminal proceedings against A.M. for breaking into the applicant’s house. According to the Government, on 24 June 2010 he was subjected to the preventive measure of an undertaking not to leave town.', '11.  On 22 June 2010 a court adopted a protection order, deciding A.M.’s eviction and ordering him to stay away from the applicant and her house. However, that order was not enforced. On 17 July 2010 the applicant was again injured by A.M. in the yard of her house, as confirmed by the police and a medical report. She lodged a new complaint and on 23 July 2010 another court order was issued, similar to that of 22 June 2010. This order was not enforced either.', '12.  On 16 August 2010 criminal proceedings were instituted against A.M. for failure to abide by the protection order of 22 June 2010. This set of proceedings was subsequently joined to the one instituted on 9 June 2010.', '13.  On 26 August 2010, during the criminal proceedings, A.M. underwent a psychiatric examination. The medical commission established that he was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and recommended in-patient psychiatric treatment.', '14.  On 7 October 2010 a prosecutor submitted the case against A.M. to the court in order to determine whether A.M. should undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. In his decision the prosecutor noted, inter alia, that A.M.’s medical history revealed that in 1965 he had suffered a blow to his head; from 1981 he had started to believe that his wife wanted to poison him and he had begun beating her; from June to September 1987 he had been treated as an in-patient in a psychiatric hospital and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; he had been under psychiatric supervision since 1988 and had undergone psychiatric treatment five more times with the same diagnosis, the last treatment period having ending on 25 December 2004; and he had been monitored by the authorities as mentally ill and dangerous to society. The parties did not inform the Court of the outcome of the prosecutor’s request.', '15.  In a letter dated 6 December 2010 the Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and Family stated that on 23 November 2010, Police Officers V.V. and R.P. from the local police station and a social assistant had visited the applicant’s house and talked with her and A.M. The latter had refused to leave the house or to sign a document stating that he had been warned not to commit acts of violence against the applicant.', '16.  On 5 December 2010 the applicant was again beaten up by A.M. On 16 December 2010 she obtained a third court order, similar to the two already issued. The court noted, inter alia, that on 5 December 2010 A.M. had again beaten the applicant up and that the police had gone to her house the following day and had imposed an administrative sanction on him for intentional destruction of property. On 24 December 2010 the applicant’s neighbour, E.C., gave a witness statement to the Ocniţa police officers. She described the many conflicts that A.M. had had with the applicant and the neighbours, the many visits by the police to the applicant’s house to warn A.M. not to commit acts of violence towards the applicant, and the fact that the head of the local police had often been in contact with her about the situation in the applicant’s house.', '17.  On 4 January 2011 the Ocniţa District Court found A.M. guilty of breaking into the applicant’s house. Having regard to the findings of the medical commission, the court absolved A.M. of criminal responsibility because he had committed the crime in a state of insanity. It also decided that A.M. should undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment.', '18.  On 14 January 2011 the applicant’s lawyer asked for a copy of the decision of 4 January 2011, stating that she had not been informed of the hearing. Moreover, her client had been unaware of it until the morning of 4 January 2011, when she had been invited to attend court by the local police. Therefore, the applicant’s procedural rights had been breached. On the same day the lawyer asked the local police and the social assistance service about the measures taken to enforce that court decision.', '19.  On 21 January 2011 the Ocniţa Police informed the applicant that they did not have the power to evict anyone and that it was the bailiff’s job to do so.', '20.  On 24 January 2011 Ocniţa police officers escorted A.M. to a specialised psychiatric hospital for medical treatment.', '21.  On 31 January 2011 the Ocniţa prosecutor’s office decided not to start a criminal investigation against Ocniţa Police Officers V.V. and R.P. in respect of an allegation by the applicant that they had been complicit in the private violence committed by A.M.'], 'applicants': ['MUDRIC'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['14', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['14', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['10', '11', '12', '14', '16', '19', '22', '23', '24', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '51', '7', '8', '9'], '14': ['14', '15', '16', '30', '51', '8', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13], 'explained_indices': [2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'explained_distances': [0.22906615, 0.13030991, 0.11074868, 0.09862754, 0.05304438, -0.004910499, -0.02198115, -0.1077435, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438, -0.2058438], 'number_of_sentences': 16, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1939 and currently lives in Pirot.', '6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '7.  On 14 September 1990 the applicant was granted an old-age pension as from 1 September 1990 by the Pirot branch (Filijala Pirot) of the Serbian Pensions and Disability Insurance Fund (Republički fond za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje zaposlenih – hereinafter “the Fund”).', '8.  Following a successful claim for unpaid wages against his former employer, on 8 December 1993 the applicant asked the Fund to amend its decision of 14 September 1990. In particular, he asked the Fund to apply a more favourable period for the calculation of his base pension and to increase his pension on account of the additional income that he had earned in the period before retirement (during 1989-90) which had not initially been taken into account (da se utvrdi nov penzioni osnov i izvrši obračun razlike u plaćanju).', '9.  Following a remittal, on 16 May 1994 the Fund issued an amended decision (hereinafter “the 1994 decision”): (i) establishing a new increased pension (14,015.66 old dinars (YUD)); (ii) establishing an increased \"base pension\" (penzijski osnov) to be applied from 1 September 1990, applying an adjustment rate of 45.30% as from 1 January 1991 and another adjustment of 28.13% as from 1 April 1994; (iii) determining that a supplementary pension should be paid on the basis of the difference between the pension received for the prior period starting on 1 September 1990 and the new pension granted retroactively by this decision; and (iv)  noting that the calculations for the pension were attached to the decision and formed an integral part of it. In addition, the reasoning in the 1994 decision contained an exact figure to be used as the base pension and determined that the applicant’s pension should be 85% of that amount.', '10.  The decision of 16 May 1994 became final on 22 July 1994.', '11.  On 31 December 2003 the applicant lodged a motion with the Pirot Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) for the enforcement of the part of the 1994 decision concerning the outstanding supplementary pension, and also sought payment of statutory interest from 25 January 1994 on the amounts due. The applicant supplied, together with his request for enforcement, an expert’s calculation determining the exact amount due.', '12.  On 20 January 2005 the Municipal Court issued the enforcement order as requested.', '13.  On 3 February 2006 the Municipal Court quashed that enforcement order following the Fund’s objection (prigovor) that there was no proof that the 1994 decision was enforceable.', '14.  On 16 February 2006 the Municipal Court requested that the Fund provide it with a reissued copy of the 1994 decision containing an enforceability clause (klauzula izvršnosti) within three days. On 22 February 2006 both the Fund and the applicant supplied the court with reissued copies of the 1994 decision containing an enforceability clause.', '15.  On 15 March 2006 the Municipal Court rejected the applicant’s fresh enforcement request. The Municipal Court firstly noted that the 1994 decision had established the applicant’s entitlement to a pension, his base pension and the date on which the applicant had acquired his right to a pension. The court found, however, that the decision in question was not “liable to enforcement” as it had not set the exact, total amount to be paid, which rather had been subject to recalculations depending on statistical data. It concluded that the outstanding debt should be therefore established only in special administrative proceedings conducted by the Fund’s accounting department - apparently the so-called “likvidatura”.', '16.  On 23 March 2006 the applicant lodged an objection against the decision of 15 March 2006, claiming that the enforcement request had contained all the figures and information necessary to calculate the amount due, also supplying an expert opinion to that effect.', '17.  On 26 June 2006 the Municipal Court upheld the decision of 15 March 2006. The competent panel, in particular, (i) noted, without making reference to the applicable domestic law, that the applicant should have asked for the mandatory enforcement of the 1994 decision in the administrative proceedings (prinudno izvršenje u administrativno-upravnom postupku (sic.)); and (ii) summarised the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the preceding civil proceedings concerning the application of the principle of monetary nominalism and revaluation of the claim (see paragraph 24 below).', '18.  In the meantime, as the Fund had failed to pay the supplementary pension to the applicant, on 25 January 1996 he filed a civil claim with the Municipal Court for the determination and payment of the outstanding supplementary pension as from 1 September 1990, and also sought statutory default interest and damages to compensate him for the effects of inflation (naknada inflatorne štete) and maladministration on the part of the Fund.', '19.  During the proceedings, on 26 May 1997, a court-appointed financial expert determined the nominal amount of the supplementary pension for the period between 1 September 1990 and 24 January 1994. The expert utilised a method of revalorisation of the pecuniary claims (metod valorizacije novčanih potraživanja).', '20.  On 8 April 2001 the court obtained an additional expert report on the statutory default interest accrued as from 17 May 1994 to that date.', '21.  Following two remittals, on 12 June 2001 the Municipal Court, noting the pension payment slips issued between 1990 and 1994, as well as the exact amounts of the new pension and the base pension as determined by the 1994 decision, awarded the applicant the outstanding difference in the pension actually paid and the applicant’s pension entitlement, plus statutory interest accrued, as well as costs.', '22.   On 4 December 2002 the Pirot District Court upheld the judgment of 12 June 2001. It clarified, as regards the Fund’s appeal, that the impugned dispute could not be the subject of administrative proceedings, as the applicant had not challenged the lawfulness of the 1994 decision, but rather had sought the payment of the pension debt and damages.', '23.  Following a remittal in the enforcement proceedings, on 6 March 2003 the Municipal Court ordered the enforcement of the judgment of 12 June 2001. On 24 July 2003 the awarded amount, including the accrued statutory interest, was transferred from the debtor’s account to that of the applicant.', '24.  Acting upon the Fund’s subsequent appeal on points of law, on 19 June 2003 the Supreme Court overturned the lower courts’ judgments. It stated that (i) in accordance with the law of obligations (the principle of monetary nominalism), the applicant was not entitled to damages to compensate him for the effects of inflation or any damages whatsoever in disputes of a public-law nature (such as the one in question); (ii) pension rights could only be established or enforced through administrative proceedings (“administrativno-upravni postupak”); (iii) even assuming that the Fund’s debt was to be considered as a statutory obligation, the applicant could not be awarded statutory interest in the civil proceedings (being a condition for a revaluation of the nominal claim), as the administrative enforcement of the 1994 decision had not been sought; (iv) the applicant could arguably seek such an award in enforcement proceedings; and (v) each party should cover its own costs and expenses. Lastly, the Supreme Court appears not to have addressed the nominal debt in its judgment.', '25.  On 7 August 2003 the Fund filed a motion for recovery of the entire sum paid to the applicant on 24 July 2003 (see paragraph 23 above) in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of 19 June 2003.', '26.  On 19 September 2003 the Municipal Court issued an enforcement order whereby half of the applicant’s pension was to be transferred to the Fund’s account each month until the sum had been repaid in full. It would appear that for the purpose of securing the debt the Municipal Court blocked the applicant’s access to his entire pension for a certain period of time.', '27.  By 30 August 2010 the applicant had repaid the total amount that he was required to pay in accordance with the above order.', '28.  The Pirot Branch of the Fund informed the Government that it was undisputed that it had failed to pay the difference between its past payment and the applicant’s pension entitlement for the period between 1 September 1990 and 31 December 1993. In that regard, the Fund explained that it had been unable to calculate and pay its debts that arose during the period of high inflation in Serbia to all beneficiaries of the pension insurance system, including the applicant, due to limitations in its computer software (iz tehničkih i programskih razloga).', '29.  The pension system in Serbia is a “pay as you go” system. The Fund is a State administrative body which is tasked with awarding and administering pensions and disability insurance payments. It is a legal entity authorised to levy compulsory social insurance contributions, in accordance with the rights and obligations determined by applicable law and its internal regulations. All pension and disability insurance contributions are transferred to the Fund’s accounts, together with the funds paid by the central government of the respondent State. The State guarantees the Fund’s obligations.', '30.  In the period between 1984 and 1994, the domestic currency heavily depreciated on several occasions, resulting in its redenomination on a number of occasions. In 1993 the annual inflation rate was calculated at more than 1.5 billion per cent, while the average daily rate of inflation was nearly 100 per cent. In October 1993 the Government created a new currency unit. One new dinar was worth one million of the \"old\" dinars.

In his appeal he wrote, inter alia:\\n“Of course, we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge, thus the fact... that he appointed a guardian ad litem despite explicit objection...is the first proof of his bias...\\nQuestioning whether or not the general assembly of the respondent was entitled to suspend its session, continue at a later point and call another general assembly is not a question of bias but that of clear-cut professional incompetence ...\\nBecause the judgment reflected the personal opinion of the judge and was not based on any evidence, we cannot but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge.

In a State based on the rule of law where proceedings should be based on the constitutional independence of judges, such judicial bias cannot be permissible.\\nBased on the above, besides our request for appeal, we also request the County Regional Court to forward our motion to the authority responsible for initiating proceedings to examine the professional [in]competence of the judge.”', '7.  The motion was transferred to the Békés County Regional Court, whose vice-president indicated to the Békés County Bar Association that, in his view, the applicant’s submissions should give rise to disciplinary proceedings.\\nOn 11 April 2003 the President of the Bar Association informed the applicant about the opening of disciplinary proceedings.\\nOn 24 April 2003 the applicant submitted his observations, contesting the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings.', '8.  In the ensuing proceedings, the Szeged Bar Association Disciplinary Board dealt with the case. On 10 June 2004 it fined the applicant 300,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 1,000 euros (EUR)) for having committed a serious disciplinary offence. On appeal, on 5 November 2004 the National Bar Association Disciplinary Board upheld this decision in essence.\\nThe applicant sought judicial review. On 19 September 2006 the Budapest Regional Court remitted the case to the disciplinary instances, essentially on procedural grounds.', '9.  In the resumed disciplinary proceedings, on 11 April 2008 the Disciplinary Board fined the applicant HUF 170,000 (EUR 570) for having committed a deliberate disciplinary offence. The Board was of the opinion that the expressions “of course, we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge”, “this is not a question of bias, but that of clear-cut professional incompetence” and “we cannot but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge” amounted to disrespecting the court’s dignity and to denying the judge the requisite respect. This was a disciplinary offence consisting of the applicant’s breaching the relevant ethical obligations.', '10.  On 3 November 2008 the National Bar Association Disciplinary Board upheld this decision, endorsing the first-instance Disciplinary Board’s position that the tone and language of the impugned statement was unacceptable and prejudicial to the reputation of lawyers.', '11.  On 2 June 2009 the Budapest Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action challenging the disciplinary sanction. The court did not agree with the applicant’s contention that in expressing the impugned statements he had merely exercised his procedural rights, that is, that he had requested the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias. It also found that the statements had accused the court as an institution, and not merely the sitting judge, of circumventing the law.', '12.  On 20 April 2010 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s petition for review, endorsing the Regional Court’s reasoning. It dismissed the applicant’s argument that the disciplinary measure had infringed his procedural right, exercised in his capacity as defence counsel, to lodge a motion for bias. Reiterating the Regional Court’s findings, the Supreme Court held that, contrary to what the applicant had argued, his notice – submitted following the closing of the first-instance proceedings (see paragraph 6 above) – could not possibly serve the purpose of seeking the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias. It further found that, in as much as the applicant’s request could be interpreted as initiating proceedings to have the judge’s professional competence examined, the reason for which he had been subjected to a disciplinary measure was not the very request, but its tone.'], 'applicants': ['KINCSES'], 'defendants': ['HUNGARY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['11', '12', '34', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 6, 7], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 6, 7], 'explained_indices': [1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'explained_distances': [0.26835018, 0.14691848, 0.10266572, 0.011166096, -0.014945269, -0.014945269, -0.014945269, -0.014945269], 'number_of_sentences': 8, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1948, and at the time of lodging the application lived in Milton, Ontario, Canada.', '6.  Malta has gone through various legislative regimes in order to regulate its housing situation. The first regime came about in 1931 and protected tenants from the termination of their leases. This was followed by the 1944 Rent Restriction (Dwelling Houses) Ordinance which, apart from regulating termination of the lease of dwelling houses, also controlled rents and the initial conditions of contracts. The Housing Act was then enacted in 1949, with the aim of providing a solution to homelessness caused by the Second World War. In 1959 the Housing (Decontrol) Ordinance, Chapter 158 of the Laws of Malta (hereinafter “the HD Ordinance”) was enacted, which provided incentives to encourage landlords to rent their property, and created a special class of dwelling houses free from rent control.', '7.  The applicant owns a property in Gozo (a maisonette measuring 105 square metres) which he inherited from his parents, his mother having passed away in 1984.', '8.  On 12 January 1960 the property was registered as a “decontrolled dwelling house” in accordance with Article 3 of the HD Ordinance. At the time, Article 5 (1) of the HD Ordinance provided that the provisions of the “Rent Ordinances” (the Reletting of Urban Property (Regulation) Ordinance, Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta and the Rent Restriction (Dwelling Houses) Ordinance, Chapter 116 of the Laws of Malta) were not applicable to dwelling houses decontrolled in accordance with Article 3 of the HD Ordinance.', '9.  In 1970 the applicant’s mother leased the premises to couple C., who are Maltese citizens (born in 1943 and 1950 respectively), for a rent of 35 Maltese Liri (MTL) (approximately 81.50 euros (EUR)) every six months, which was later decreased to the equivalent of EUR 75.70 every six months. At the time, the law permitted her to increase the rent, to refuse to renew the lease or to change its terms on renewal.', '10.  In 1979 the Maltese parliament enacted an amendment to the HD Ordinance, which provided that the rent restrictions set out in the Rent Ordinances would apply where tenants were Maltese citizens and occupied houses as ordinary residences. It further provided that landlords could not refuse to renew leases, raise their rent, or impose new conditions on renewal, except as provided for by law (see “Relevant domestic law” below). The applicant submitted that the contractual freedom of parties was greatly restricted as a result of the new provisions, in that his family could not charge a fair rent or recover possession of their property, despite the fact that his tenants owned substantial immovable property.', '11.  By a decision of the Rent Regulation Board (RRB) of 7 July 1998, the rent was further reduced to EUR 65.22 per year. The applicant did not appeal.', '12.  In 1995 new laws were enacted in respect of new leases which could again be free from rent control. They did not apply to the applicant’s case.', '13.   In 2009 and 2010 new concepts and provisions were introduced, aimed at gradually eliminating the restrictive regimes applicable to leases entered into before 1995.', '14.   Thus, while a rent of EUR 65.22 per year had been paid to the applicant since September 1998, a rent of EUR 185 had been paid from September 2010 onwards in view of the above-mentioned amendments. However, the applicant refused to accept any rent as from 2007 and it was duly deposited in court by the tenants by means of a schedule of deposit.', '15.  According to a court-appointed architect’s evaluation made in the context of constitutional proceedings instituted in 2005 (see paragraph 17 below), the property at that time had a rental value of EUR 2,912 per year. According to an architect’s report commissioned by the Government, the rental market value in 2013 was EUR 2,900 per year, and the sale value EUR 58,000.', '16.  To date, couple C still reside in the applicant’s property. It does not at present appear that they have any children formally residing with them.', '17.  In 2005 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining, inter alia, that the 1979 amendments (in particular Article 5 (2) and (3) of the HD Ordinance, which prohibited landlords from refusing to renew existing leases or from raising their rent) had breached his property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.', '18.  On 4 June 2008 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction rejected his complaint. Basing its judgment on domestic case-law relating to the same subject matter, it considered that he remained the owner of the property at issue, which was being used as a dwelling house, that he could still evict the tenants if they failed to fulfil their obligations under the lease, and that although the amount of rent was low, the law provided for an increase in rent every fifteen years, amounting to double the actual rent. The interference with his rights was therefore proportionate given the needs of society. Moreover, his mother had not been forced to lease out the property.', '19.  The applicant appealed on 25 June 2008.', '20.  On 3 November 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed his appeal as being lodged out of time, the statutory time-limit having expired on 16 June 2008.', '21.  On 29 April 2009 he lodged an application with the Court, relying on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.', '22.  By a decision of 10 November 2009 the Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, declared the applicant’s application inadmissible. It found that he had lodged his appeal with the Constitutional Court out of time. The domestic remedies had therefore not been exhausted as required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.', '23.  In 2010 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that the 1979 amendments, which prohibited landlords from refusing to renew existing leases or from raising their rent when the tenant was a Maltese citizen, had breached his property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. He submitted that the amendments introduced in 2009 had not improved his situation, even assuming they (in particular Article 1531C of the Civil Code) applied to the case in question, a matter which was unclear in the domestic context. With a new rent of EUR 185 per year (see Relevant domestic law below), he remained a victim of the alleged violation, not least because he was also prevented from refusing to renew the lease. He cited the then recent case of Amato Gauci v. Malta (no. 47045/06, 15 September 2009), in which the Court had found a violation in analogous circumstances.', '24.  By a decree of 30 April 2010 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction ruled that the defendant in the case should be the Attorney General of Malta, not the State of Malta as purported by the applicant.', '25.  On 15 October 2011 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction, upholding the objection raised by the third party who joined in the suit (kjamat fil-kawża), rejected the applicant’s complaint on the basis that the matter had already become res judicata by virtue of the decision of 4 June 2008 (see paragraph 18 above). It noted that such a conclusion required three elements, namely the same parties (eaedem personae), the same object (eadem res) and the same cause of action (eadem causa petendi). Moreover, where the arguments raised were different, it had to be seen whether they could have been raised at the time of the principal judgment. In the present case, it considered that there had been no doubt that the requirement of eaedem personae had been met, despite the fact that the applicant had attempted to bring the present proceedings against the State and that the other proceedings had been against the Attorney General, as it was clear that the defendant in both cases was the Maltese Government. The element of eadem res had also been satisfied in so far as the present case concerned the same lease of the same property, with the same tenants and the same circumstances that had led the applicant to institute proceedings the first time round. Similarly, the element of eadem causa petendi had also been satisfied, since the applicant’s applications to the court were to a great extent the same, if not identical, despite the fact that he had made further arguments and submitted that his situation had remained unchanged notwithstanding the 2009 amendments to the Civil Code. The court considered that the changes to the application had not changed the nature of the action, namely a claim that the restrictions on the rent imposed by the law had been disproportionate. This matter had already been dealt with by the court in the first set of proceedings (no. 49/05), where it had decided that a fair balance had been struck by the authorities; it was not therefore open to the applicant to relitigate the matter. The court further held that even though the applicant had argued that despite the 2009 amendments (if they applied at all) he had remained a victim of the alleged violation, there was already a judgment in his respect stating that the law in so far as it applied to his case had not breached his rights, and the more recent amendments had not worsened his situation. Thus, the Civil Court (First Hall) held that there could not have been a breach of his rights even under the new law. Lastly, it concluded that any new arguments put forward by him should have been incorporated into the first set of proceedings. As to the Court’s recent case-law, it considered that the judgment cited did not entitle the applicant to ask for a fresh examination of his case.', '26.  By a judgment of 24 June 2011 the Constitutional Court upheld the first-instance judgment, considering the appeal to be frivolous and vexatious.'], 'applicants': ['ANTHONY AQUILINA'], 'defendants': ['MALTA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1'], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-1': ['15', '29', '44']}, 'silver_rationales': [10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [10], 'explained_indices': [1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 10, 11, 20, 9, 8, 7, 6, 12, 21], 'explained_distances': [0.060864925, 0.055288076, -0.0069280863, -0.015054822, -0.017807603, -0.017925978, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886, -0.017954886], 'number_of_sentences': 22, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Opole, Poland.', '5.  In 1998 the prosecution service filed with the Opole District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a bill of indictment in which it charged the applicant with making unlawful threats. In the course of the court proceedings the applicant was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. On 6 November 2001 the trial court held a hearing at which the applicant and his court‑appointed lawyer were present. During the hearing, the court scheduled the next hearing for 4 December 2001 about which the applicant was informed.', '6.  On 4 December 2001 a hearing took place before the trial court. The applicant did not attend the hearing but his counsel was present. The applicant failed to give any reasons for his absence and the trial court finished the proceedings and decided in the presence of the counsel that the judgment would be delivered on 11 December 2001.', '7.  On 11 December 2001 the Opole District Court delivered a judgment in which it convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to a prison term of one year and six months. Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present at the delivery of the judgment.', '8.  The applicant did not appeal against the judgment of 11 December 2001 and did not apply for a copy of the reasons of that judgment.', '9.  Subsequently, the applicant lodged an application for leave to apply for a reasoned judgment out of time. In his application, he argued that his absence at the hearing held on 4 December 2001 was justified because he had been recently released from the detention and on 5 December 2001 he had been assaulted. The applicant also complained that he had not been informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment. On 9 April 2002 the Opole District Court examined the application and dismissed it. The court, in a reasoned decision, established that the applicant had known about the hearing scheduled for 4 December 2001. He failed to attend it without providing any justification for his absence. Therefore, the trial court was entitled to terminate the proceedings in his absence on the basis of Article 376 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further examined the reasons for the absence submitted by the applicant. It established that in fact he had been released on 22 November 2001 - two weeks prior to the hearing. Moreover, while it was true that the applicant had been assaulted, nevertheless, that had happened the day following the hearing and the injuries sustained by the applicant, according to a hospital certificate, were not serious and the applicant was not admitted to hospital. With regard to the complaint that he was not informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment, the court found that the applicant had not been diligent since he had not contacted his lawyer. The applicant was aware of the scheduled hearing and knew the address and the name of his court‑appointed lawyer.\\nThe applicant appealed against this decision. On 16 May 2003 the Opole Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) examined the reasons given by the District Court and upheld the decision.', '10.  On 14 January 2002 the applicant started serving the prison sentence ordered by the judgment of 11 December 2001.', '11.

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Bucharest.', '6.  The case concerns the criminal investigations against the applicant, a police officer; two other police officers, I.U. and R.B; and two business people, H.S. and S.B. The applicant was suspected of having facilitated contact between the other two police officers and H.S., who acted on behalf of S.B., in order for the two police officers to convince a prosecutor to revoke, in exchange for a significant bribe, an international arrest warrant issued in the name of S.B. in the context of a different criminal investigation concerning financial crimes.', '7.  On 18 June 2002, the applicant was summoned to the office of the Military Prosecutor attached to the Supreme Court of Justice for questioning. He was informed that he was suspected of conspiracy to commit bribery and on the same date he was placed in pre-trial detention.', '8.  On 11 July 2002 an indictment was issued and on 12 July 2002 the file was transferred to the Bucharest Military Tribunal. The evidence submitted by the prosecutor included transcripts of recordings of telephone conversations between the accused, some of which were in Romanian and some in Hebrew.', '9.  The applicant’s pre-trial detention was regularly extended by the competent courts and his requests to be released on bail were all dismissed.', '10.  On 4 December 2002, the military court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the case. On 7 January 2003, the Supreme Court of Justice established that the Bucharest Court of Appeal was the competent court to hear the case.', '11.  By an interlocutory judgment of 12 March 2003, the Bucharest Court of Appeal ordered a technical expert examination of the audio tapes submitted to the file by the prosecutor. In a hearing held on 19 March 2003, all the accused denied that the voices on the audio tapes were theirs and disputed the authenticity of the tapes. In the interlocutory judgment issued on that date, the Court of Appeal stated the following:\\n“In respect of the [prosecutor’s] request to review the decision to adduce as evidence a technical expert examination of the audio tapes, the court considers that it is ill-founded, given that the basis for the indictment as well as the main evidence against the accused are precisely these audio recordings and their transcriptions and that the accused denied that the voices on the tapes were theirs or that those discussions took place; therefore it is necessary to draw up an expert report on the recordings.”', '12.  The hearings were postponed several times, among other reasons because the technical expert report was not ready. The expert report had to be drawn up by the National Institute for Forensic Expertise (“the INEC”), an institution governed by the Ministry of Justice.', '13.  In a hearing on 13 October 2003, the Court of Appeal took note of the fact that the accused had requested that the audio tapes be played in court in order to establish and verify whether the transcripts from the case file corresponded with the recordings, whether the recordings had been made in line with the legal requirements, and whether some excerpts had been taken out of context. The domestic court further considered that given the fact that it had ordered a technical expert report on the tapes, the tapes could not be played in court until they had been analysed.', '14.  In a hearing on 24 November 2003, the parties discussed a letter sent by the INEC in which it stated that it did not have experts qualified to carry out voice identification. The accused insisted that a new date be set for the hearing once an expert report had been included in the materials of the file.', '15.  In a hearing on 15 December 2003, the parties were informed that the technical report was not ready. The lawyer representing S.B. insisted that if the transcripts were to remain in the case file, it was essential to have the report. The applicant’s lawyer stated that the accused contested the evidence itself, as the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been respected, and that it should be completely removed from the case file. The lawyer representing R.B. stated that the tapes could not be heard by the court until they had been analysed in order to verify their authenticity. In a last address to the court, the applicant stated that he had not been presented with the transcripts of the tapes and was not aware of their content.', '16.  On 22 December 2003, the Court of Appeal concluded that, given the letter from the INEC and the conditions under which the tapes had to be analysed, the time it would take and the position of the accused, it was impossible to prepare the report. Considering also that the expert report was superfluous since there was already enough evidence in the file, the court revised its decision to adduce this evidence.', '17.  The final hearing was held on 12 January 2004. The prosecutor declared that the applicant’s guilt had been proved by the statements of the co-accused and by the recordings of the applicant’s phone conversations, the transcripts of which were available in the investigation file. The applicant was charged with having put H.S. in contact with two of his fellow officers, who were closer to the husband of the prosecutor who was to be bribed, in the knowledge that the purpose of the introduction was to bribe the prosecutor to revoke the arrest warrant in the name of S.B. The co‑accused changed their statements during the judicial proceedings, stating that the applicant had not been aware of the reason why H.S. had wanted to get in touch with the prosecutor and that he had never attended the meetings at which they had discussed the matter. The prosecution held that they were aware that the statements had been changed and considered the new statements to be insincere.', '18.  In his final submissions before the first-instance court, the applicant asked to be acquitted on the ground that he had not committed any offence. He insisted that he had never taken part in any discussion between S.H. and the prosecutor’s husband.', '19.  From the information submitted by the applicant, it appears that on 21 January 2004 the INEC submitted its report, which concluded that the audio tapes were not original. It stated that in the absence of any additional information, the tapes could be copies, mixings done with or without the intent to present a false reality, or fabricated. It also stated that voice identification could only be carried out on original recordings using the same equipment as that used for the recording.', '20.  By a first-instance judgment of the Bucharest Court of Appeal of 26 January 2004, the applicant was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for conspiracy to commit bribery. After presenting at length the prosecutor’s submissions, the court proceeded with its own reasoning. It presented the facts, as established by the evidence in the file, and then stated:\\n“Even if all the other evidence adduced can be considered subjective to some degree, the transcripts of the phone conversations between the accused do not leave room for much doubt as to their activity, their behaviour, the way in which they intended to solve the problem, their attitude towards the State institutions, as well as their opinions concerning certain colleagues (police officers), prosecutors, judges, representatives of the Secret Services and even leaders of the Romanian State.\\n...\\nAs has been mentioned above, the telephone conversations between the accused, which were recorded over several months, show clearly and without any doubt that the accused committed with intent the crimes with which they have been charged and accepted the risks deriving from them. During the criminal trial, in an attempt to defend themselves, they argued that the recordings had been unlawfully obtained, that the transcripts did not conform to the recordings, that in parts the voices were not theirs, and that excerpts of the transcripts had been taken out of context and had not been extensively presented, all of which led to the request to hear the tapes in the presence of a Hebrew-speaking assistant witness, and later to the request for a technical evaluation to be carried out. (...) At the same time, it should be noted that the only institution which had a legal obligation to carry out the technical evaluation of the recordings did not comply with that obligation and with the order of the court, rendering it impossible to adduce this piece of evidence.”', '21.  The applicant and all the other accused lodged an appeal on points of law. The applicant asked for the quashing of the first-instance judgment on several grounds: that the courts examining the case had lacked jurisdiction and the composition of the courts had been unlawful; that his arguments concerning the evidence adduced in the case had not been addressed; that the constitutive elements of the crime for which he was convicted had been lacking; and that the decision was contrary to the law.', '22.

The applicants were born in 1966 and 1972 respectively and live in Amsterdam.', '9.  The first applicant entered the Netherlands in October 1989. From his relationship with the second applicant, who has been lawfully residing in the Netherlands since the age of seven and holds a permanent residence permit (vestigingsvergunning), a child, Adem, was born on 27 June 1990. The applicants married on 25 October 1990. One month later, the first applicant filed a request for a residence permit for the purposes of forming a family unit (gezinsvorming) with his wife and working in the Netherlands. This permit was granted on 12 February 1991. On 24 January 1992 the first applicant acquired the right to remain in the Netherlands indefinitely ex jure pursuant to Article 10 para. 2 of the Aliens Act 1965 (Vreemdelingenwet 1965).', '10.  On 31 July 1992 the first applicant was arrested and placed in detention on remand. The Regional Court of Amsterdam convicted the first applicant on 20 January 1993 of participating in an organisation aimed at committing offences and of being a co-perpetrator (medepleger) of intentionally being in the possession of about 52 kilos of heroin, committed on or around 31 July 1992. The first applicant was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. In respect of the determination of this sentence, the Regional Court held as follows:\\n“... in the decision to impose a sentence involving a deprivation of liberty and the duration thereof, the Regional Court is in particular taking account of the fact that the accused has for a long time let his house be used as a safe house for quantities, of considerable size and suitable for further distribution, of a substance harmful to public health, so that only a prison sentence of considerable duration is appropriate.”\\nThe first applicant was released on 11 April 1995. He went back to live with his wife and child and found a job.', '11.  Due to marital problems, the applicants did not live together for some time in 1995/1996. On 28 November 1995 the first applicant’s name was removed from the municipal register as living at the same address as his spouse. He was registered as once again living in the matrimonial home on 25 June 1996.', '12.  On 14 May 1996 both applicants went to the Aliens’ Police Department as they were going to resume cohabitation and wanted to prolong the first applicant’s residence permit. However, an official at that Department told them it would be better if the first applicant applied for an independent residence permit. For that reason, an application was made for prolongation of the first applicant’s residence permit or for an amendment of the restrictions attached to that permit so that it would enable him to reside in the Netherlands for the purpose of working in salaried employment without being required to live with his spouse.', '13.  On 14 October 1996 a second child, Mahsun, was born to the applicants. Both children have Turkish nationality.', '14.  The Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) informed the first applicant on 7 March 1997 of her intention to impose a ten-year exclusion order on him by declaring him an undesirable alien (ongewenst vreemdeling). The first applicant was invited to submit his views on the matter. By letter of 24 March 1997 the first applicant declared that he would never again do anything wrong and asked to be given a second chance.', '15.  The Deputy Minister rejected the request for prolongation of the residence permit on 5 June 1997. According to the Deputy Minister, the first applicant had lost his indefinite right to remain on 28 November 1995 when he had ceased to cohabit with his wife. The fact that the spouses had in the meantime resumed cohabitation did not have the effect of reviving this right ex jure. Although Netherlands policy provided that aliens, following the dissolution or breakdown of their marriage on the basis of which they had acquired an indefinite right to remain, could under certain circumstances, relating to the duration of the marriage, be eligible for an independent residence permit, the prolongation of a residence permit could also be refused on general interest grounds. In view of the first applicant’s criminal conviction of 20 January 1993, the Deputy Minister considered that it was justified to deny the first applicant further residence and to impose a ten-year exclusion order. The interference with the first applicant’s right to respect for his family life was held to be justified in the interests of public order and for the prevention of crime. Having regard to the seriousness of the offences committed by the first applicant and the duration of the prison sentence imposed on him, the Deputy Minister concluded that the interests of the State outweighed those of the first applicant.', '16.  The first applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against this decision. It was rejected on 19 March 1998 by the Deputy Minister who adopted the advice issued by the Advisory Board on Matters Concerning Aliens (Adviescommissie voor Vreemdelingenzaken). This Board was of the opinion that the first applicant’s request should be considered as a request for an independent residence permit (onafhankelijke verblijfsvergunning) in view of the fact that the right to remain indefinitely, pursuant to Article 10 § 2 of the Aliens Act 1965, did not constitute a residence permit which was eligible for prolongation or for amendment of the restrictions attached to it. The Board further considered, notwithstanding the fact that the first applicant had moved back to the matrimonial home after a separation of six or seven months, that the breakdown of the applicants’ marriage had been of a permanent nature given the duration of the separation and the first applicant’s request for an independent residence permit which did not require him to cohabit with his wife. Therefore, the question to be examined was whether, at the time of losing the indefinite right to remain, the first applicant had been eligible for continued residence (voortgezet verblijf).', '17.  Having regard to the first applicant’s criminal conviction, which implied that he had violated public order, the Board considered that the request for a residence permit should be refused and an exclusion order imposed. It saw no merit in the first applicant’s expressions of regret nor in his arguments to the effect that his wife and two children resided in the Netherlands and that he had been working in the Netherlands since 21 June 1995. In this connection the Board, referring to the duration of and the reasons for the prison sentence as set out in the judgment of the Regional Court of 20 January 1993, had regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence of which the first applicant had been convicted. The Board did not consider that the period of time between the conviction and the imposition of the exclusion order was so long that for that reason alone the authorities ought to refrain from taking that measure. In this respect it was borne in mind that the first applicant had held an indefinite right to remain from 24 January 1992 until 28 November 1995 which, pursuant to the policy in force, stood in the way of an exclusion order being imposed.\\nFinally, as far as the first applicant’s rights under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention were concerned, the Board considered that the interests of the State outweighed those of the first applicant.', '18.  The first applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of The Hague, sitting in Amsterdam. He argued, inter alia, that there had not been any breakdown of his marriage, let alone one of a permanent nature. The spouses had merely not cohabited for a number of months because of marital problems; however, the first applicant had remained in contact with his wife. Moreover, during this time their child Mahsun had been conceived. The first applicant was gainfully employed, did not constitute a threat to public order and he had extricated himself from the criminal circles in which he had previously been involved. In the view of the first applicant, it was unreasonable to deny him continued residence and to impose an exclusion order on him more than four years after his criminal conviction.', '19.  In its judgment of 12 November 1998 the Regional Court agreed with the Deputy Minister that the applicants’ actual close family ties (feitelijke gezinsband) had been severed as a result of their temporary separation and that as a result the first applicant had lost his indefinite right to remain. It upheld the Deputy Minister’s decision in so far as the denial of continued residence was concerned. Having regard to the nature of the offence of which the first applicant was convicted and the length of the prison sentence imposed, the Regional Court considered that the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for family life was necessary in the interests of the protection of public order. In respect of the exclusion order, which denied the first applicant the right to visit the Netherlands even for short periods, the Regional Court quashed the impugned decision. It found that insufficient weight had been accorded to the interests of the applicants and their children. Thus, no attention had been given to the consequences which the exclusion order would have for the applicants and their children, both in the case where the other family members would follow the first applicant to Turkey and in the case where they would remain in the Netherlands. In this connection the Regional Court noted that the children, who had close links with the Netherlands as they had been residing there since their birth, might at this stage of their lives have a great need for regular contacts with their father within their own surroundings (levenssfeer), and not exclusively abroad. The exclusion order rendered such contacts – including occasional contacts – impossible.', '20.  On 6 May 1999 the Deputy Minister decided anew on the first applicant’s objection in so far as this concerned the exclusion order. She declared the objection well-founded and lifted the exclusion order.', '21.

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Istanbul.', '7.  On 12 February 1993 the applicant started working as a judge in Tufanbeyli district in Adana.', \"8.  On 14 August 1995 the General Command of the Gendarmerie submitted a formal complaint to the judicial inspection board attached to the Ministry of Justice concerning the applicant's behaviour. A disciplinary investigation into the allegations was conducted by a judicial inspector.\", '9.  On 1 March 1996 the judicial inspection board notified the applicant in writing that a disciplinary investigation had been carried out under Section 82 of Law no. 2802 into a number of acts which he had allegedly committed and which were considered incompatible with his status as a judge. The letter set out the charges against the applicant and he was requested to submit his defence in writing.', '10.  The charges, five in all, included the accusation that the applicant had undermined the honour and dignity of the judiciary as well as respect for his own position as a judge (the first charge). The other four charges related, inter alia, to reported incidents of his conflictual behaviour towards his colleagues and to his failure to respect the dress code of the profession and working hours.', '11.  The judicial inspector drafted a report dated 27 March 1996, according to which there was no evidence to justify opening an investigation into the first set of charges. However, he stated that evidence had been obtained that the applicant had behaved in a conflictual way with his colleagues and that he shaved only once a week, came late to work and did not wear a tie. This report was submitted to the judicial inspection board of the Ministry of Justice. The Government submitted that the judicial inspector heard evidence from the Governor, the public prosecutor, the applicant and his colleagues.', '12.  On 29 April 1996 the Minister of Justice approved the transfer of the whole case file to the Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors (“the Supreme Council”) with a view to the consideration of possible disciplinary measures under Section 87 of Law no. 2802.', '13.  With regard to the first set of charges concerning the accusation that the applicant had undermined the honour and dignity of the judiciary as well as respect for his own position as a judge, the applicant was accused of introducing himself at various social events as being “of Kurdish origin” and of behaving in a manner which displayed his sympathy for the PKK[1]. It was stated that the applicant had said: “If they throw me out of the judiciary, I will go to Germany to join the organisation.” It was further alleged that the applicant talked to Kurdish-speaking citizens in Kurdish in order to gain their sympathy. He was also accused of regularly reading a legal publication of the PKK, Özgür Ülke, until it was banned and of watching Med TV a PKK-controlled television channel, via a satellite, antenna at his home.', '14.  In respect of the remaining sets of charges, the applicant was accused of quarrelling on various occasions with the public prosecutor, of shaving only once a week, of not wearing a tie at work and of coming to work late.', '15.  In his written submissions to the Supreme Council, the applicant denied the accusations against him, maintaining that they were false, inaccurate and incomplete or had been misinterpreted. He assumed that the evidence against him consisted of statements given by his colleagues and other civil servants. He alleged that certain persons were hostile to him since he had previously lodged formal complaints against them. In this connection, he submitted that, in the past, he had made formal complaints against the public prosecutor, Mr H.A. and the elected major, Mr H.K. The applicant therefore maintained that the public prosecutor, as a result of certain personal and professional disagreements which they had had, spread false accusations against him and had convinced other local government officials to make further similar accusations. The applicant gave some examples of situations where he had been in conflict with the public prosecutor. He affirmed that he believed in all the fundamental principles of the Turkish Republic and served the State faithfully.', \"16.  He admitted, inter alia, that, on certain occasions and during private conversations, he had stated that he was a Kurd, had criticised certain unlawful acts of the State authorities and had maintained that a distinction should be made between the innocent population of Kurdish origin and the PKK. The applicant submitted that he condemned terrorist acts and that it was an insult to suggest that he sympathised with the PKK. He asserted that while none of his family members and close friends had ever been interrogated for terrorist offences, the public prosecutor's brothers were in custody on allegations of aiding and abetting the PKK and his nephew had been remanded in custody for alleged PKK membership.\", '17.  The applicant further admitted reading Özgür Ülke which, in his opinion reported, on the events in south-east Turkey, albeit in a biased manner. He argued that the incidents reported in the region were a problem which the country was facing and he, like everyone else, had the right to be informed about them. He pointed out that he also read various other lawful publications for the same purpose. Moreover, he argued that the fact that he read certain lawful partisan publications did not convey his approval of the views expressed therein. As to the allegation that he regularly watched MedTV at home, the applicant explained that he had never been able to watch the channel due to technical difficulties with the reception. He argued that, even if he had watched the channel in question, this was not unlawful. The applicant further refuted the remainder of the accusations brought against him.', '18.  On 11 July 1996 the Supreme Council, after assessing the evidence in the file as well as the written defence previously submitted by the applicant, found by a majority that the evidence in the file was sufficient to conclude that the allegations against the applicant were well‑founded. In respect of the first set of accusations, the Supreme Council concluded that the applicant should be transferred to another jurisdiction as a sanction pursuant to Section 68 (a) and (b) of Law no. 2802. In respect of the remaining accusations, the applicant received a reprimand. The contents and the sources of the evidence in the file which were relied on were not restated in the decision.', '19.  On 4 November 1996 the applicant requested the Supreme Council to rectify its decision. In his petition, he reiterated his previous submissions and requested that evidence be heard from his colleagues. The applicant maintained, inter alia, that the accusations against him were the result of lies propagated by the public prosecutor and his friends. He affirmed that he had always maintained his impartiality. He also submitted that as a young judge he might have made certain mistakes due to his inexperience, but that he should not be punished in such a harsh manner for his mistakes.', \"20.  On 14 November 1996 the Supreme Council unanimously rejected the applicant's request for a rectification of its decision.\", \"21.  On 17 April 1997 the Supreme Council's appeals board dismissed the applicant's objections.\", '22.  The applicant was transferred to Şenpazar district in Kastamonu.', '23.  Following an enquiry by the applicant, the Supreme Council decided on 2 October 1997 that the applicant could not be promoted for a period of two years on account of the disciplinary sanction of transfer to another jurisdiction imposed on him pursuant to Section 30 § 4 of the Law no. 2802.', '24.  The applicant was subsequently appointed to Çamoluk district in Giresun. His requests of 9 January 1998 and 29 December 1998 to be appointed to a region carrying a higher rank were rejected by the Supreme Council in decisions of 12 February 1998 and 14 April 1999 respectively.', \"25.  On 9 December 1999 the Supreme Council dismissed the applicant's request for a retroactive promotion. It noted that the disciplinary sanction against the applicant had been erased pursuant to Law no. 4455 and that it would not be an obstacle to future promotions. However, it considered that this situation did not render null and void the Supreme Council's decision not to promote the applicant for two years.\", '26.

The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Novosibirsk.', \"7.  The applicant receives an old-age pension. The Law of 21 July 1997 on the Calculation and Upgrading of State Pensions (“the Pensions Act”) introduced, from 1 February 1998 onwards, a new method for calculating pensions. The idea behind this method, based on what is known as an “individual pensioner coefficient”, was to link the pension to the pensioner's previous earnings.\", \"8.  The authority in charge of the applicant's pension, the Pension Fund Agency of the Sovetskiy District of Novosibirsk (“the Agency”), fixed the applicant's coefficient at 0.525. The applicant challenged the Agency's decision in the Sovetskiy District Court of Novosibirsk. He argued that his coefficient should be 0.7.\", \"9.  On 26 August 1999 the District Court found for the applicant, considering that the Agency had misinterpreted the Pensions Act. In particular, it held as follows:\\n“... the vague wording of the Article [Article 4 of the 1997 Pensions Act] permits the law to be interpreted in two ways, and this has resulted in the unfounded reduction of calculated pensions and in pensioners' complaints.”\\nThe District Court decided that the Agency was to recalculate the applicant's pension using a coefficient of 0.7 from 1 February 1998.\", '10.  The Agency appealed against the judgment. On 11 November 1999 the Novosibirsk Regional Court upheld the judgment, which became enforceable on the same day. The judgment was never executed.', '11.  On 29 December 1999 the Ministry of Labour and Social Development (“the Ministry”) issued an Instruction on the “Application of Limitations” established by the Pensions Act (“the Instruction”). The Instruction clarified how to apply the Pensions Act.', \"12.  On 24 January 2000 the Agency lodged an application with the District Court for the reconsideration of the applicant's case owing to newly discovered circumstances. They asked the court to take account of the Instruction, which supported their arguments that had been rejected by the court during the initial examination of the case. They pointed out that the Ministry was empowered to give an official interpretation of laws.\", \"13.  Some time thereafter a group of individuals challenged the Instruction before the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. On 24 April 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint. It found that, contrary to what the complainants had suggested, the Ministry of Labour had not acted ultra vires in issuing the Instruction, and that the Ministry's interpretation of the Pensions Act had been correct. On 25 May 2000 the Cassation Division of the Supreme Court upheld this judgment on appeal.\", \"14.  From 1 August 2000, following changes to the pension regulations, the applicant's pension was calculated based on a coefficient of 0.7125. After 1 May 2001 the coefficient was fixed at 0.9.\", \"15.  On 6 June 2001 the District Court examined the Agency's request. The Agency submitted at the hearing that the Instruction had been upheld by the Supreme Court. The applicant argued that the Instruction was subordinate to the Pensions Act, that it was not a newly discovered circumstance and that the Agency had missed the statutory time-limit for requesting the reconsideration.\", \"16.  The District Court noted that the Instruction had been issued after the judgment in the case had become enforceable, that the Pensions Act itself had not changed and that the Instruction had been required because of the “different interpretation of the [Pensions] Act's provisions by claimants, officials and the RF Pension Fund”. The court further noted that the Instruction had been upheld by the Supreme Court. It held as follows:\\n“When delivering its judgment on 26 August 1999 the court interpreted the provisions of the [Pensions] Act on its own. The newly discovered circumstances in this case are the official interpretation of the [Pensions] Act in the Instruction of the RF Ministry of Labour and the case-law of the RF Supreme Court”.\\nThe court noted that the Agency's application had reached the court on 24 January 2000 and that, therefore, it was not time barred.\", \"17.  In a decision of 6 June 2001 the District Court granted the Agency's application, under Article 337 of the Code of Civil Procedure, quashed the judgment of 26 August 1999, as upheld on 11 November 1999, and ordered a fresh examination of the case. It stated that its decision was final and not subject to appeal.\", \"18.  As a result of the fresh examination of the case the District Court delivered a judgment of 21 June 2001 in which it relied on the Instruction and rejected the applicant's claims in full.

According to the applicants, who cited articles published in the Cyprus Mail newspaper of 5, 6 and 7 June 1996 in this connection, had access not been denied to the persons seeking to provide medical assistance there would have been a good chance of saving Stelios Kalli Panayi's life.\", '11.  The applicants produced a report from the UN Secretary-General dated 7 June 1996. In so far as relevant, this document reads as follows:\\n“The third incident took place on 3 June 1996. An unarmed National Guard soldier was shot and killed inside the UN buffer zone in central Nicosia. The investigation has revealed that the lethal round was fired by a Turkish-Cypriot soldier whom UNFICYP had observed entering the buffer zone with his rifle strung across his back. Shortly thereafter a single shot was heard and the Turkish-Cypriot soldier was seen running back in a crouched position to the Turkish ceasefire line holding his rifle in his right hand. UNFICYP soldiers were prevented from reaching the National Guard soldier by Turkish-Cypriot soldiers who fired shots in the direction of the UNFICYP soldiers each time the latter tried to move forward. UNFICYP strongly protested to the Commander of the Turkish forces in Cyprus the unauthorised entry of an armed Turkish Cypriot soldier into the buffer zone, the shooting incident and the hostile action, including live fire against UNFICYP. UNFICYP is pursuing with the Turkish forces in Cyprus and with the Turkish-Cypriot authorities the question of appropriate action and has requested that UNFICYP police investigating the killing be able to interview the Turkish-Cypriot soldier involved in the incident. The military authorities on both sides have been urged once again to respect the UN buffer zone and ensure its integrity.”', \"12.  The applicants' lawyer requested a copy of the relevant reports from UNFICYP. However, his request was refused as the documents in question were considered to be internal UN documents.\", '13.  According to the Government, the chain of events which led to the death of Stelios Kalli Panayi could be summarised as follows.', \"14.  The incident took place in a part of Nicosia where the Pedios River marked the boundary of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”). In the Turkish part of the buffer zone were the Yıldırım sentry post and the positions of the Turkish-Cypriot security forces. The positions of the Greek-Cypriot army (the National Guard) were on the Greek-Cypriot administration's defence line, 2-3 metres west of the UNFICYP patrol road. The UN-60 observation post was about 250 metres south of the sentry positions of each of the two sides. The Yıldırım sentry post was located on high ground which ran down steeply to the river bed; the latter was marshland, covered with high reeds; on the Greek-Cypriot side there were huge eucalyptus trees.\", '15.  The UN patrol road was on the other side of the river and entry into “TRNC” territory by UNFICYP soldiers was possible only by crossing a wooden bridge. The area starting five metres west of the Yıldırım sentry post in the direction of the Greek-Cypriot sentry post could not be observed from the UN observation post building, which had a view over the Turkish and Greek-Cypriot positions but not the area in between.', '16.  On the day of the incident it was observed from the Yıldırım sentry post that a fully armed soldier of the National Guard, who was wearing army uniform, had come out of his duty station and had entered the buffer zone. He made gestures by hand and called to the Turkish-Cypriot soldiers on sentry duty to go over to him. One of the Turkish-Cypriot soldiers on duty warned him in a loud voice in Turkish, English and Greek not to approach; another Turkish-Cypriot soldier asked the Turkish-Cypriot patrol to come to the area. Ignoring the verbal warning, Stelios Kalli Panayi proceeded into the buffer zone and descended towards the river bed; a Turkish-Cypriot soldier came out of his sentry post and walked about 5 metres in a westerly direction in order to be able to observe the National Guard soldier advancing. At this moment another Turkish-Cypriot soldier took up position on the southern side of the communication trench; a soldier was also located above the trench at a point where he could have a better view of the vicinity of the river. He shouted once more to the Greek-Cypriot soldier, using the Greek word “Ochi” (“No”), and instructed him to leave the area.', '17.  In spite of this Stelios Kalli Panayi entered into “TRNC” territory by crossing the wooden bridge which only UNFICYP soldiers were allowed to use. Two warning shots were fired by a Turkish-Cypriot soldier (one into the air and one towards the ground); as Stelios Kalli Panayi proceeded further into “TRNC” territory, causing a serious threat to the lives of the Turkish-Cypriot soldiers, one more shot was fired to stop him.', '18.  On hearing the gunshots, a UNFICYP soldier came out of his observation post, located 250 metres south of the scene of the incident and started to look around; as he did not have a clear overall view, he proceeded towards the place where the gunshots had been heard and was about to cross the bridge. However, he was warned by means of two shots fired into the air by the Turkish soldiers not to advance any further. In fact, the situation was still critical as it was not known whether Stelios Kalli Panayi had adopted a more advantageous crawling position.', '19.  At 7.01 a.m. an ambulance arrived in the area by the Peace Force patrol road. Stelios Kalli Panayi was placed in the ambulance, which left for the hospital. Later, the Turkish-Cypriot authorities were informed that he had died.', '20.  The Government produced a number of documents, including:\\n(a)  a map and some photographs of the area where the incident had taken place;\\n(b)  a list of the “incidents that took place at the Greek-Cypriot Guard Post”, giving details of 69 episodes, including firing into the air, provocation by throwing stones and use of abusive language;\\n(c)  several articles published by Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot newspapers concerning the circumstances of the killing of Stelios Kalli Panayi, the differences between the versions of the facts given by the two sides and political reactions to the incident.', \"21.  The Government further produced the following documentary evidence[1]:\\n(a)  A note dated 6 June 1996 from the “TRNC” Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence addressed to the Office of the Prime Minister (with a copy to the Director of Intelligence, Counter-Intelligence and Security), which reads as follows:\\n“Upon being informed that a Greek Cypriot pathologist accompanied by UNFICYP will conduct an investigation at the scene of the incident whereby on 3rd June 1996 a GCNG soldier was shot, the UNFICYP has been contacted so that a pathologist from our side could also conduct a similar investigation at the scene of the incident on the basis of the principle of equality as well as reciprocity.\\nIn accordance with the agreement reached with UNFICYP, the same day Dr. Engin Arkan from Dr. Burhan Nalbantoğlu State Hospital has conducted an investigation at the scene of the incident and the report that he prepared is enclosed herewith.”\\n(b)  The following note dated 6 June 1996 signed by Dr Engin Arkan and addressed to Dr Burhan Nalbantoğlu of Lefkoşa (Nicosia) General Hospital (with a copy to the Director of Intelligence, Counter-Intelligence and Security):\\n“Regarding the shooting of a Greek-Cypriot soldier today in the buffer zone, accompanied by UNFICYP I went to the scene of the incident. In order to reach the scene of the incident, we crossed the bridge known as the Normandy bridge in the buffer zone by vehicle, went to the vicinity where the GCNG and UNFICYP positions are located and stepped out of the vehicle. From there we proceeded to the north by crossing a wooden bridge and from right after there we reached the scene where the incident took place, which is approximately 50-75 meters from the Turkish positions in the North. At the said place there were [a] trail of blood with 15cm diameter and a GCNG cap. According to the explanation given to me the bullet entered from the side of the right rib cage and exited from the left and it was also explained that the bullet also smashed the right arm from below the shoulder.\\nAlso according to the explanation given to me, the corpse [was] found lying with his head towards North-West and foot South-East direction.\\nAfter having this information, accompanied by UNFICYP, [I] returned to Ledra Palace and entered TRNC by walk.”\\n(c)  A statement by the “TRNC” Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence, which reads as follows:\\n“This morning at 6.30 hours in Köşklüçiftlik area of Lefkoşa a fully equipped GCNG soldier was observed approaching the Turkish position in the area, upon which he was warned to stop by our guard first in Turkish, then in Greek and English. GCNG soldier continued to proceed towards our guard and our guard fired two warning shots, one in the air and one to the ground. Despite numerous verbal warnings and warnings by fire, the GCNG soldier continued to proceed and violated the border, a shot was fired and he was observed to fall down. At 7.00 hours with the arrival of UNFICYP ambulance to the scene the GCNG soldier was evacuated.\\nWe protest and condemn this irresponsible act which resulted in the violation of the borders of TRNC and remind once more the necessity for application of required measures by the parties concerned to prevent recurrence of such incidents.”\\n(d) An “information document on death incident”, a copy of which was addressed to the Director of Intelligence, Counter-Intelligence and Security and which contained the following information:\\n“1. TYPE OF INCIDENT: Firing on the Greek-Cypriot National Guard (GCNG) soldier who violated the Turkish Contact Line. 5. DETAILS OF INCIDENT: On the 3rd of June, 1996 at 6:30, the guards situated at the YILDIRIM Guard Post, in the 3rd Infantry Battalion, saw a fully equipped GCNG soldier approaching the wooden bridge on KANLI DERE, which only UNFICYP Patrol is permitted to use. Then, the guards at the post called the Patrol guards, who were 250 meters to the south of the Guard Post and at the same time they verbally warned the GCNG soldier. Since the GCNG soldier suddenly disappeared, one of the guards from the Guard Post moved 10 meters forward from the post and continued observing.\\nOne of the Patrol Guards, who came to the area warned the GCNG soldier verbally and by gun, and then fired and shot him, while he was passing the wooden bridge and violating the TRNC border. After the arrival of UNFICYP and Turkish officers to the area, the GCNG soldier, who fell down, was taken by ambulance at 07:05 and it was found out that he was dead.\\nThe guards of ZYAD Guard Post, which is to the south of the YILDIRIM Guard Post, Infrantry Private Ecevit AKSU and Infantry Private Dogan GURCE observed the acts of UN-60 UNFICYP Guard, when the incident occurred. They stated that the UNFICYP Guard was sitting at the guard post when the incident occurred and he went out after he heard the first gun shot. Then he started to observe the YILDIRIM Guard Post. 3-5 seconds later, he heard 2 gun shots and he ran to the area of the incident. After 5-6 minutes, 2-3 more bullets were fired. The total number of shots heard was 6 or 7.\\nDuring the incident, the Patrol Guards Infantry Corporal Zafer Ali SECKIN fired 5 times (one bullet into the air as a warning, one bullet at the ground as a warning, one bullet to the target, and 2 bullets into the air as warning to stop the UNFICYP soldier). The other Patrol Guard Infantry Corporal Ibrahim OGUT fired 2 times (as warning to prevent the UNFICYP soldier from approaching), so 7 bullets were fired in total. 6. THE REASON FOR THE INCIDENT: The GCNG soldier's persistent violation of the Buffer Zone and the Turkish Contact Line despite the verbal warnings and warnings by fire. 7. PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN INCIDENT: The guards of the YILDIRM Guard Post, Infantry Private Kemal GIYINER and Infantry Private Huseyin CUMBUSCU were present during the incident; however, the personnel who fired were Infantry Private Zafer Ali SECKIN, the son of Ahmet, born in 1977 and registered in Magosa, and the other patrol was Corporal Ibrahim OGUT. 8. CONDITION OF THE AFFECTED PERSON: It was observed that the GCNG soldier, who fell down after being shot was taken by ambulance and it was found out that he died. 10. PROCEDURE FOLLOWED AFTER INCIDENT:\\na. The GCNG soldier who was shot was taken from the place of incident by ambulance and was brought to the Greek-Cypriot Hospital in Southern Cyprus.\\nb. Rapid Reaction Squad was sent to the place of incident.\\nc. All units were informed about the incident, steel vests and steel helmets were distributed especially to all the guards at the contact line, guard posts were reinforced and observation activities were increased.”\\n(e)  A note from the “TRNC” Security Forces Command (1st Infantry Regiment) dated 5 June 1996 concerning “the National Guard soldier who was shot for violating the line of contact”, which reads as follows:\\n“The incident that took place at 06.30 on 3 June 1996 at the YILDIRIM observation post – (coordinates 31750-93190); located within the area under the control of the 8th Infantry Division of the 1st Infantry Regiment's 3rd Infantry Battalion – during which a GCNG soldier was shot dead, is described below. 1. On the day of the incident a fully equipped GCNG soldier, whose weapon was not visible, came out of the GCNG squad post – which is located 100 metres to the west of the YILDIRIM observation post at the Southern Cyprus Greek Administration's line of contact (coordinates 31750-93100) – and entered the buffer zone. He then waved at two guards at the YILDIRIM observation post and called them by saying “come here brother”. The guards warned the GCNG soldier by shouting in Greek “OXİ” and asked him, in Turkish, Greek and English, to stop. After the Greek Cypriot soldier had entered the buffer zone, one of the guards radioed patrols who at the time were 100 metres away to the north, and asked them to come to the area. One of the guards then walked 10 metres to the west of the YILDIRIM observation post in order to be able to observe the GCNG soldier who, by then, had gone into the river bed and was out of sight. In the meantime, the patrols who came from the communication trenches and who took up positions told the guard to return to his post and shouted at the Greek Cypriot soldier to leave the area.\\nWhen the Greek Cypriot crossed the wooden bridge, which had been built on Kanlı River in the 1980s for the exclusive use of the P.F. patrol personnel, and started advancing into the TRNC territory, one of the patrols fired two warning shots, first into the air and then at the ground. When the GCNG soldier ignored the warning shots and continued to advance, he was fired upon. When the Greek Cypriot soldier fell to the ground the patrols thought that he had taken up a position and continued to observe him. The patrols also reported the incident to the duty officer by radio. 2. A P.F. soldier at the UN 60 observation post – which is located at approximately 250 metres to the south of the place of the incident – heard the shots and came out of his observation post and then started looking around. He saw our guard, who had been warned by the patrols, running back to the YILDIRIM observation post. [The P.F. soldier], unable to see the incident from his position, advanced in the direction of the shooting and arrived at the place of the incident. The patrols were concerned about a possible attack by the Greek Cypriot soldier and they warned, first orally and then by firing two warning shots into the air, the P.F. soldier who, by then, had been attempting to cross the wooden bridge. [The patrols] thus prevented the P.F. soldier from approaching the place of the incident. A P.F. officer then arrived in the area. 3. At 06.55, when the ambulance arrived at the scene using the P.F. patrol road, it was established that the Greek Cypriot soldier had been injured. With the permission of a Delegation of Guards and the Commanding Officer who had arrived at the scene in the meantime, [the ambulance] was allowed to take the Greek Cypriot soldier away. This was photographed by the Commanding Officer. 4. The subsequent investigation of the place of the incident and of the relevant personnel [revealed that] the GCNG soldier who crossed into the TRNC soil and who was deemed to be carrying an assault weapon which could have posed a risk to our guards, was warned and then shot in accordance with the existing orders, instructions and rules of engagement.”\\n(f)  Two notes which read as follows:\\n“THE POSSIBILITY OF THE P.F. GUARD AT THE UN 60 GUARD POST WITNESSING THE INCIDENT\\nThe UN 60 guard post is located at a 250 metre distance from the place of the incident and 200 metres away from the YILDIRIM S.F.C. guard post. 3 metre-long reeds covering the river bed and the trees in the area prevent the place of the incident from being seen from the UN guard post. However, the P.F. guard can see the actions of the Turkish soldiers at the YILDIRIM guard post within a radius of 5 metres. At the time of the incident the Turkish guard at the YILDIRIM guard post advanced 10 metres away from his post in order to observe the GCNG soldier and asked the GCNG soldier to stop and leave the area. When the GCNG soldier insisted in continuing, the patrols who arrived at the scene warned the GCNG soldier and asked the Turkish guard – a corporal – to return to his trench. The guard then returned to his guard post. It might have been possible for the P.F. guard to see the Turkish soldier returning to his guard post. The Turkish soldier in ZİYAD guard post, which is at a distance of 20 metres from the UN 60 guard post, saw the P.F. guard sitting in the UN 60 guard post. Both the P.F. guard and the Turkish guards left their posts after the first shot was fired. The P.F. guard, who is said to have witnessed the incident, then continued to observe the incident. Furthermore, it is not possible to go down to the scene of the incident from the YILDIRIM guard post because the river bed is too steep and is covered with 3 metre-long reeds. Even entering the river bed from another direction would not enable the P.F. guard to see.”\\n“THE TAKING AWAY OF THE GCNG SOLDIER FROM THE AREA BY THE P.F. PERSONNEL\\nThe incident took place at 06.30. As stated in the UN report, the P.F. guard called for an ambulance only at 6.45 and reported the incident. The P.F. personnel arrived in the area at 06.50 and were given permission to approach the scene of the incident by the duty Turkish officer, commander of the duty [soldiers] and the commander of the Division. The ambulance arrived at 7.01, the GCNG soldier was put in the ambulance immediately and the [ambulance] left the area at 7.05.”\", '22.  The Government drew the attention of the Court to the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (hereinafter “the UN Force and Firearms Principles”), adopted on 7 September 1990 at the Eighth UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. The relevant provisions of this document read as follows:\\nParagraph 5\\n“Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall:\\n(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved;\\n(b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life;\\n(c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment;\\n(d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.”\\nParagraph 7\\n“Governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their law.”\\nParagraph 9\\n“Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.”\\nParagraph 10\\n“In the circumstances provided for under principle 9, law enforcement officials shall identify themselves as such and give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would unduly place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the incident.”\\nParagraph 11\\n“Rules and regulations on the use of firearms by law enforcement officials should include guidelines that:\\n(a) Specify the circumstances under which law enforcement officials are authorized to carry firearms and prescribe the types of firearms and ammunition permitted;\\n(b) Ensure that firearms are used only in appropriate circumstances and in a manner likely to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm;\\n(c) Prohibit the use of those firearms and ammunition that cause unwarranted injury or present an unwarranted risk;\\n(d) Regulate the control, storage and issuing of firearms, including procedures for ensuring that law enforcement officials are accountable for the firearms and ammunition issued to them;\\n(e) Provide for warnings to be given, if appropriate, when firearms are to be discharged;\\n(f) Provide for a system of reporting whenever law enforcement officials use firearms in the performance of their duty.”'], 'applicants': ['KALLIS', 'ANDROULLA PANAYI'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['2'], 'violated_articles': ['2'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['11', '17', '20', '21', '22', '39', '42', '43', '45', '60', '66', '73']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 11, 14, 15, 16], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 11, 14, 15, 16], 'explained_indices': [8, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 15, 16, 6, 7, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2], 'explained_distances': [-0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.10483691, -0.16433623, -0.19881395, -0.2006934, -0.3035522, -0.3247144, -0.33139417], 'number_of_sentences': 17, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The first applicant is a limited liability company with its registered seat in Brno. It owns a five-storey tenement house in Brno, which it bought in 1994 for 1,450,000 Czech korunas (CZK 52,920[1] euros (EUR)). There is a shop on the ground floor and one flat on each remaining floor. In three of these four flats the rent was regulated. The rent in those three flats was CZK 2,037 (EUR 74), CZK 2,007 (EUR 73) and CZK 1,392 (EUR 50.80) respectively per month. The monthly rent for the fourth flat was fixed at CZK 5,200 (EUR 190).', '7.  On 10 February 2004 the first applicant sued the State for damages in the amount of CZK 229,563 (EUR 8,378) corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the usual rent in the given area as estimated by the first applicant for the period between February 2002 and end of January 2004.', '8.  On 22 December 2004 the Prague 1 District Court (obvodní soud) dismissed the first applicant’s action. It held that it was not possible to award damages under the State Liability Act since failure to enact deregulating legislation could not be qualified as an “incorrect official procedure” within the meaning of the Act. Moreover, the adoption by the Ministry of Finance of decrees nos. 01/2002 and 06/2002 could not be qualified as an incorrect official procedure either.', '9.  On 28 February 2006 the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud) dismissed an appeal by the first applicant. It held that the impossibility of reaching an agreement on deregulating legislation in Parliament could not be qualified as an “incorrect official procedure” within the meaning of the State Liability Act. The court added that in respect of the period from February 2002 to 20 March 2003 rents had been regulated by Government Decree no. 567/2002.[2] Although that decree had subsequently been repealed by the Constitutional Court, the latter’s judgments were not of retroactive effect and thus previous contractual relationships remained unchanged. Accordingly, there was no legal basis for compensation for that period.', '10.  On 24 October 2007 the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud) dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the first applicant. It found that the legislative procedure in Parliament could not be described as an “administrative procedure” under the State Liability Act and that it was impossible to engage liability on the part of the State for the result of voting in Parliament.', '11.  On 27 November 2008 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) dismissed a constitutional appeal lodged by the first applicant as manifestly ill-founded, holding that actions for damages against the State had a subsidiary character and that the applicant company should have started by bringing an action for rent increase.', '12.  The applicant owns a tenement house in Prague consisting of eleven flats and three non-residential premises. The application concerns seven of these flats for which the applicant collected regulated rent in the total amount of CZK 398,196 (EUR 14,533) for the period between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004 while the usual rent in the given locality would have amounted to CZK 1,757,160 (EUR 64,130) according to an expert report commissioned by the applicant. The applicant and his sister acquired the house under the restitution law in 1992. The applicant’s sister later transferred her share to the applicant.', '13.  On 4 January 2005 the applicant sued the State for damages in the amount of CZK 1,358,964 (EUR 49,597) corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the usual rent in the given locality for the period between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004.', '14.  On 12 October 2005 the Prague 1 District Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It held that it was not possible to qualify the failure by Parliament to enact deregulating legislation as an “incorrect official procedure”. While the previous regulations had been repealed by the Constitutional Court, this did not produce a retroactive effect and thus no damages could be awarded for the period of time during which they were in force. The applicant should have brought an action against the tenant requesting the court to determine the amount of rent according to the local and material conditions (nahrazení projevu vůle nájemců k určení výše nájemného, které by odpovídalo všem místním i věcným podmínkám).', '15.  On 2 February 2006 the Prague Municipal Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant. It held that the impossibility of reaching an agreement on deregulating legislation in Parliament could not be qualified as an “incorrect official procedure” within the meaning of the State Liability Act. As regards the period until 20 March 2003, the court added that rents had been regulated by Government Decree no. 567/2002. Although it had subsequently been repealed by the Constitutional Court, the latter’s judgments did not have retroactive effect and thus the previous contractual relationships remained unchanged. Accordingly, there was no legal basis for compensation for that period.', '16.  On 28 February 2008 the Supreme Court declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant.', '17.  On 30 October 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional appeal as manifestly ill-founded, holding that actions for damages against the State had a subsidiary character and that the applicant should have started by bringing an action for rent increase.', '18.  The applicant owns a tenement house in Brno consisting of seven flats and two non-residential premises. She became the sole owner of the house on 11 July 2004 as a result of restitution (in March 1992), gifts (in October 1994), inheritance (in September 1997) and purchases from five other family members (July 2004). She collected regulated rent for three of those flats in the total amount of CZK 251,484 (EUR 9,178) for the period between 1 July 2002 and 31 August 2005 while the usual rent in the given locality would have amounted to CZK 1,158,059 (EUR 42,265) according to an expert report commissioned by the applicant. The applicant occupied one flat and let two flats to her son and daughter.', '19.  On 14 October 2005 the applicant sued the State for damages in the amount of CZK 906,575 (EUR 33,087) corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the usual rent in the given locality for the period between 1 July 2002 and 31 August 2005. On 19 January 2006 she withdrew her claim in respect of an amount of CZK 166,077 (EUR 6,061).', '20.  On 9 May 2006 the Prague 1 District Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It held that it was not possible to qualify the failure by Parliament to enact deregulating legislation as an “incorrect official procedure”. The applicant should have brought an action against the tenant requesting the court to determine the amount of rent according to the local and material conditions.', '21.  On 24 January 2007 the Prague Municipal Court upheld that decision. In respect of the period up to 20 March 2003, it held that rents had been regulated by several regulations. Although these had subsequently been repealed by the Constitutional Court, its judgments were not of retroactive effect and thus the previous contractual relationships remained unchanged. As a result, no compensation could be awarded for that period. As regards the subsequent period, the court held that the impossibility of reaching an agreement on deregulating legislation by Parliament could not be qualified as an “incorrect official procedure” within the meaning of the State Liability Act. State responsibility could however flow from general liability under civil law. Yet, it would be very difficult to establish a causal link between the damage and an unconstitutional failure on the part of the State to enact deregulating legislation. Referring to the Constitutional Court’s judgments nos. Pl. ÚS 20/05 and I. ÚS 489/05 (see paragraphs 105 and 118 of Annex II), the court held that as of 2 June 2006 at the latest the applicant could have brought an action pro futuro. As regards the period between 20 March 2003 and 2 June 2006 the Municipal Court stated that the applicant should have brought an action against the tenants for forfeiture of the proceeds of unjust enrichment. Given that the litigation stemmed from an unlawful situation which was to a substantial extent caused by the State’s inactivity, and the persisting evolution of the case-law, which had not yet been settled, the applicant was exempted from payment of the costs of the proceedings incurred by the State both for the first-instance and the appellate proceedings.', '22.  On 26 March 2008 the Supreme Court declared inadmissible the applicant’s appeal on points of law. It found that the legislative procedure in Parliament could not be described as an “administrative procedure” within the meaning of the State Liability Act and that it was impossible to engage liability on the part of the State for the result of voting in Parliament.', '23.  On 21 April 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. She explained, inter alia, that an action against the State was the only avenue she could use. It was not possible to bring an action against the tenants. First of all, the lower courts had been dismissing such actions between 1 July 2002 and 31 August 2005, which was the period to which her claim related. Moreover, that judicial practice corresponded to the established case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 167 of Annex II) and the result of any action against the tenant was thus fully foreseeable. Further, the possibility of bringing an action for rent increase had been created by the Constitutional Court only in its landmark judgment no. Pl. ÚS 20/05 of 2 June 2006. In any event, contrary to the opinion of the Municipal Court, it was not possible to use that avenue in the applicant’s case. Referring to the Constitutional Court’s judgment no. I. ÚS 489/05 (see paragraph 118 of Annex II), the applicant argued that her only option was to bring actions against the tenant pro futuro whereas her action concerned the past.', '24.  On 18 December 2008 the Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant as manifestly ill-founded, holding that actions for damages against the State had a subsidiary character, and the applicant should have started by bringing an action for rent increase.', '25.  On 15 May 2003 the applicant bought a tenement house in Domašov nad Bystřicí at public auction. The rent was regulated in nine out of the twelve flats. The rent in one of the flats was set at CZK 1,081 (EUR 39) per month. The non-regulated rent for a smaller flat was CZK 2,000 (EUR 73). Had there been no rent regulation, then rent in a flat affected by the control would be CZK 2,541 (EUR 93) a month (calculation based by compering yield per sq. m. of regulated and non-regulated flat).', '26.  On 26 April 2006 the Olomouc District Court (okresní soud) ordered the tenant of that flat to vacate it. On 30 August 2006 the applicant filed a request for enforcement of that decision.', '27.  On 9 October 2007 he lodged an action for payment of CZK 14,650 (EUR 530) corresponding to the outstanding rent for the period between 1 July 2006 and 30 April 2007. On 14 December 2007 the District Court dismissed that action on the ground that the tenant had actually vacated the flat on 30 June 2006.', '28.  In 2008 the applicant lodged an action for payment of CZK 14,514 (EUR 530) for the period between 1 February and 31 July 2006 corresponding to the difference between the regulated rent and the rent that he considered usual in the given locality.', '29.  On 28 April 2008 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. It referred to the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court and held that rent could be increased only pro futuro. Moreover, the applicant’s action could not be granted on the basis of forfeiture of the proceeds of unjust enrichment either because the parties had concluded a valid tenancy agreement.', '30.  On 4 December 2008 the Ostrava Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld the District Court’s analysis and dismissed an appeal by the applicant.', '31.  On 21 May 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant, holding that landlords were not entitled to claim retroactively from tenants the difference between the regulated rent and the usual rent in the given locality. It noted that previous opinions to the effect that it was possible to lodge retroactive claims against tenants had been overruled by its Opinion no. 27/09 of 28 April 2009.', '32.  The applicant owns numerous other tenement houses where the rent was regulated. He introduced separate domestic proceedings regarding those houses and ultimately lodged eleven other applications (nos. 25463/05, 32090/06, 36658/09, 36687/09, 38720/09, 39868/09, 43750/09, 46064/09, 53957/09, 3968/10, 8463/10) before the Court where he complains of the rent regulation scheme in the Czech Republic.', '33.  The applicants own a tenement house in Prague consisting of six flats, one of which was rented under the rent-control scheme. The rent was set at CZK 2,396 (EUR 87) per month. The applicants bought the house in May 2001 for CZK 4,000,000 (EUR 145,985).', '34.  On 17 July 2003 the applicants informed the tenants of an increase in rent that would newly be CZK 9,000 (EUR 328) monthly, which the tenants refused to pay. On 22 September 2003 they sent a letter of reminder to the tenants, who, on 5 October 2003, again refused to pay the increased rent.', '35.  On an unspecified date the applicants brought the case before the Prague 8 District Office, which was empowered to determine the level of the rent according to the rent agreement (dohoda o užívání bytu). On an unspecified date the District Office had declined jurisdiction and informed the applicants that they should bring an action before the courts. The final reminder before the court action was sent to the tenants by the applicants on 19 June 2005.', '36.  On 30 June 2005 the applicants thus lodged an action for payment of the increase in rent for the period from July 2003 to December 2004 amounting to CZK 118,874 (EUR 4,338).', '37.  On 22 February 2006 the Prague 8 District Court dismissed their action.', '38.  On 25 October 2006 the Prague Municipal Court upheld the first-instance judgment. Referring to the case-law of the Constitutional Court, and especially its judgment no. I. ÚS 489/05 of 6 April 2006 (see paragraph 118 of Annex II), it held that rent could not be increased retroactively.', '39.  On 8 April 2009 the Supreme Court declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants.', '40.  On 16 July 2009 the Constitutional Court, referring to its Opinion no. 27/09 of 28 April 2009, dismissed a constitutional appeal lodged by the applicants, holding that a rent increase could be claimed only pro futuro from the date of lodging the action against the tenants.', '41.  On 2 January 2008 the applicants also lodged a claim for damages against the State under the State Liability Act for the period from July 2004 to December 2006.

The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in İzmir.', \"5.  On 7 June 1997 the applicant passed an exam for the post of a private security guard and was subsequently employed to work for Etibank, a State-owned company. However, the exam results were subsequently annulled on the basis of a report prepared by inspectors who had found a number of wrongdoings in the conduct of the examination. The applicant's contract of employment was terminated.\", '6.  On 27 November 1997 the applicant brought an action before the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court, challenging the annulment of the exam results. He also asked to be reassigned to his post. The Ankara Administrative Court decided on 9 December 1997 that it had no jurisdiction to examine the case and forwarded the case file to the Konya Administrative Court.', '7.  On 5 March 1998 the Konya court decided that it also did not have jurisdiction to examine the case and sent the file to the Supreme Administrative Court which decided, on 15 June 1998, that the Ankara Administrative Court had jurisdiction.', '8.  On 14 April 1999 the 7th Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court decided in favour of the applicant and he was reinstated in his previous post.

The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently in Frosinone Prison.', '9.  On 28 November 1999 the applicant was discovered in possession of a package containing 485 grams of heroin and was arrested by the Rome carabinieri. Proceedings were instituted against him for drug trafficking. On 23 December 1999 the applicant appointed a lawyer of his own choosing, Mr M., who represented him throughout the proceedings.', '10.  The applicant subsequently requested, through the intermediary of his lawyer, adoption of the summary procedure (giudizio abbreviato) provided for in Articles 438 to 443 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). The representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office gave a favourable opinion. The Rome preliminary hearings judge, taking the view that the charges against the applicant could be determined on the basis of the steps in the proceedings taken at the preliminary investigation stage (allo stato degli atti) ordered that the summary procedure be adopted.', '11.  At the private hearing held on 24 March 2000 in the presence of the applicant, the latter, through the intermediary of his lawyer, pleaded not guilty on the ground that the drugs had been intended for his personal use and not for sale.', '12.  In a judgment of 24 March 2000 the Rome preliminary hearings judge sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment and a fine of 40,000,000 lire (approximately 20,658 euros). He observed that the quantity of drugs permitted for personal use must not exceed what was required to meet immediate needs. At the time of his arrest, the applicant had just purchased a quantity corresponding to more than 8,000 average daily doses.', '13.

In his final submissions, the public prosecutor requested that the impugned decision be set aside.', '18.  In a judgment of 24 January 2002 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It observed that neither the Convention nor the CCP required the steps in the proceedings to be translated into the language of a non-national defendant in Italy. However, the latter had the right to be assisted free of charge by an interpreter in order to be able to understand the charges against him and follow the progress of the proceedings. As to the other complaints, the Court of Cassation observed that the presence of the defendant was not required under the summary procedure, the adoption of which had been requested by the applicant himself of his own free will.

The applicants were born in 1979 and 1971 respectively. The first applicant lives in Bucharest, and the second in Afumaţi, Ilfov county.', '5.  On 11 November 2003 the prosecutor started criminal proceedings against “George” and “Florin”, later identified as the applicants, based on information that they were trafficking in drugs. No other details were given in this decision of the prosecutor.', '6.  On 18 November 2003 the police division responsible for the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking (“the police”) sought authorisation from the prosecutor’s office to use an undercover agent and to obtain two grammes of heroin in order to gather evidence of the applicants’ alleged involvement in drug trafficking. It relied on Law no. 143/2000 on the fight against drug trafficking and illegal drug use (“Law no. 143”). The same day, the organised crime and drug trafficking section of the prosecutor’s office at the Bucharest Court of Appeal (“the prosecutor’s office”) authorised the operation for ten days and handed over the two grammes of heroin to the undercover agent (referred to in the domestic proceedings as “Alex 1”).', '7.  The police set up the surveillance operation in the car park of McDonald’s Dristor (Bucharest), where the trafficking was thought to happen. Meanwhile G.M., a police collaborator (referred to in the domestic proceedings as “Alex 2”), set up a meeting with the first applicant, whom he had known previously.', '8.  At 13.45 Alex 1 arrived by car in the parking area together with Alex 2. The first applicant and another man were sitting in another car. Alex 2 got out and approached the applicant; he was to tell him that Alex 1, whom the applicant did not know, wanted to contact a person who could sell him two grammes of heroin. After a short talk, Alex 2 returned accompanied by the first applicant; the latter then left by car with Alex 1. The police followed the car until it stopped in front of a building on Zizin Street. The applicant made a phone call from Alex 1’s mobile phone. He left the car and entered the building, where he remained for 10-15 minutes. He then returned with the second applicant to Alex 1’s car. The first applicant took the right front seat, while the second applicant remained standing near the right front door of the car. Alex 1 handed money to the first applicant; the latter passed it to the second applicant who took it and walked away.', '9.  At that moment the police got out of their cars and shouted: “Police, stop!”. The second applicant started running, abandoning his jacket and the money. He managed to escape into one of the neighbouring buildings.', '10.  The first applicant was identified and searched. Sixteen tablets of methadone were found on him. He admitted that the tablets belonged to him and declared that he was a rehabilitated drug user and was authorised to take methadone. A small package containing 1.5 g of heroin was visible in the car near the gear lever. The police seized it.', '11.  The same day a search was conducted in the flat from where the second applicant had come, and where he lived with S.F., his partner. No drugs were found.', '12.  The first applicant was taken into custody for 24 hours, but released on 19 November 2003. While in custody, he was taken to hospital under suspicion that he had swallowed a package of heroin. The treatment did not confirm the suspicions.', '13.  The second applicant was apprehended on 18 May 2004 after being noticed on the street by Alex 1. He was taken into police custody. On 20 May 2004 the Bucharest County Court ordered his pre-trial detention for thirty days. His detention was subsequently extended by the court every thirty days until the end of the proceedings before the first-instance court.', '14.  On 18 November 2003 the first applicant made a statement to the police, in the presence of a lawyer. He admitted to having facilitated the drugs sale between Alex 1 and the second applicant. He stated that he had taken the money from Alex 1 and handed it to the second applicant, who had then put a small bag of heroin near the gear lever. He also stated that he had obtained the methadone tablets from a nurse in Badgasar Hospital in exchange for a bag of coffee.', '15.   The prosecution file contains a second statement in the same terms, which is not dated and is signed only by the first applicant. He claimed it had been taken the same day, on his arrest.', '16.  The next day, however, the first applicant, in the presence of his lawyer, changed his position and stated before the Bucharest County Court that he was not a drug dealer and had not taken drugs for two years. He also stated that G.M. had requested him to make the second applicant come out of his house, where the police would be present. He had only agreed to help because he understood that it was a covert police operation. He maintained that an exchange of money for a small bag had occurred between Alex 1 and the second applicant. He also confirmed that the sixteen tablets of methadone were for his own use and that he had obtained them without prescription.', '17.  When interviewed by the prosecutor on 5 and 7 July 2004 the first applicant took the same position as before the County Court. He explained that he had given the statement of 18 November 2003 thinking that he would be participating in the criminal proceedings only as a witness and not as an accused.', '18.  On 19 May 2004 the second applicant told the prosecutor that he had not handed anything to the first applicant, that he had not known what the small package found in the car contained and that he had only agreed to accompany the first applicant to the car because the latter had told the second applicant that he had money for the second applicant’s partner, S.F. He also declared that at that moment he had not known that S.F. was a drug dealer. On 1 March 2004 S.F. was also arrested for drug trafficking in the context of a separate investigation.', '19.  The second applicant maintained his above statements on 20 May 2004 before the Bucharest County Court and on 7 July 2004 in an interview with the prosecutor.', '20.  On 12 July 2004 the prosecutor’s office indicted the applicants for possession and sale of dangerous drugs in violation of Law no. 143. It established, based on the evidence gathered, that the second applicant had given the small bag of heroin to the first applicant, who had handed it to Alex 1, and that in exchange Alex 1 had given him the money, which he had then handed to the second applicant.', '21.  The prosecutor noted that the first applicant had been found guilty of possession and consumption of drugs in 2001 and that the second applicant had no known criminal record.', '22.  The applicants gave statements on 7 September 2004. The first applicant reiterated that he had only agreed to contact the second applicant because he had been informed of the covert police operation. The second applicant maintained his position and denied trafficking in drugs.', '23.  The undercover agent and the collaborator supported the prosecutor’s version of the facts and maintained that the first applicant had not been aware of the police operation.', '24.  Some of the witnesses who had been unfavourable to the applicants during the investigations changed their statements before the court and claimed that they had signed without reading statements drafted entirely by the police.', '25.  At the hearing on 20 May 2005, after several reminders left unanswered by the prosecutor’s office, the applicants’ lawyers no longer insisted on obtaining an answer concerning the fate of the bag of heroin released to Alex 1 for the covert operation.', '26.  On 25 May 2005 the Bucharest County Court gave judgment, acquitting the applicants. It considered that the elements in the file indicated that on 18 November 2003 the police had sought to provoke a drug sale and had failed. Consequently, the heroin received by Alex 1 from the prosecutor’s office had been placed in the car to prove the alleged commission of the criminal offence. The court also noted that the criminal proceedings had been started illegally on 11 November as at that date there had been no relevant information on the applicants’ alleged criminal behaviour, and the facts under investigation had only taken place on 18 November. It also noted that the exchange of money for drugs was not proved, and that the witnesses could not support the prosecution’s version. The court ordered the second applicant’s immediate release.', '27.  On 3 October 2005 the appeal proceedings started before the Bucharest Court of Appeal, on an application lodged by the prosecutor’s office. The Court of Appeal heard evidence from the prosecutor and the applicants’ lawyers. The applicants used their right to address the court before the end of the hearing (ultimul cuvânt al inculpatului). No other evidence was requested by the parties or heard by the court.', '28.  On 10 October 2005 the Court of Appeal convicted and sentenced the first applicant to seven year’s imprisonment and the second applicant to six years’ imprisonment. It considered that the detailed description of the events made by the undercover agent and the collaborator should have been given more weight as they corroborated the police reports on the arrest in flagrante delicto and thus reflected the truth. The court decided that the first applicant had not been honest in his statements and that he had only claimed to have been aware of the covert police action because he knew from his own experience that collaborators were protected by law. It also concluded that the second applicant’s aim had been to protract the investigations. The court took the fact that the witnesses changed their position as proof of their dishonesty.\\nThe Court of Appeal set aside the County Court’s finding of incitement as follows:\\n“The court considers, unlike the first-instance court, that Article 68 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable so long as the evidence does not show that Constantin Marius Georgian was threatened or coerced to commit the facts. Likewise it is not proved that he was persuaded by the police to commit a crime, ... he agreed to facilitate the drug sale, but no longer admitted to it before the court.”\\nIt considered the arguments based on the origin of the heroin found as follows:\\n“... Constantin Marius Georgian himself stated when apprehended by the police and in subsequent statements that the drugs found in the car had been handed over by Stoian Florin, in exchange for 6,000,000 lei.”', '29.  The first applicant was also convicted of illegal possession of sixteen tablets of methadone.', '30.  The court deducted the second applicant’s preventive detention from “19 May 2004 to 25 May 2004”. It also confiscated, under Article 17 § 1 of Law no. 143/2000, the eight tablets of methadone and 1.48 g of heroin left after the laboratory tests from the first and the second applicant respectively.', '31.  On 11 May 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice upheld the conviction following an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants.\\nIt also corrected the material error in the appeal decision concerning the second applicant’s preventive detention, and in an interlocutory judgment of 14 July 2006 noted that he had been detained from 19 May 2004 to 25 May 2005.', '32.  On 7 July 2004 and on 2 June and 16 August 2006 the applicants lodged criminal complaints against G.C., the prosecutors in charge of their investigation, the undercover agent and the witnesses alleging that they had given false testimony to the investigative authorities. In addition, the first applicant, in the appeal of 7 July 2004, complained that several items adduced by him as evidence had disappeared from the criminal file. On 11 October 2004 and 23 May and 13 June 2007 the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided not to prosecute G.C. and Alex 1. On 25 February 2008 a similar decision was taken in respect of the witnesses by the prosecutor’s office at the Bucharest District Court.'], 'applicants': ['CONSTANTIN', 'STOIAN'], 'defendants': ['ROMANIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['10', '11', '12', '21'], 'X': ['30', '31']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 7, 8, 17, 26, 27], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 7, 8, 17, 26, 27], 'explained_indices': [14, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 27, 28, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 13, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2], 'explained_distances': [-0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.0023194999, -0.054828867, -0.067105755, -0.1617842, -0.28377122, -0.44742075], 'number_of_sentences': 29, 'article_id': 11, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants are German nationals born in 1979 and 1978 respectively. They are currently serving prison sentences in Germany, following their conviction by the Romanian authorities for drug trafficking, as described below.', '6.  At the time of the impugned events, S.R.B., one of the applicants’ acquaintances, was in police custody accused of drug-related offences. In the context of a covert operation, S.R.B. agreed to contact the applicants by phone in order to arrange a drug transaction. It appears that following several phone conversations between S.R.B. and the first applicant, the latter agreed to deliver 5,000 Ecstasy pills to Romania.', '7.  On 9 November 2007 the prosecutor in charge of investigating S.R.B.’s case issued an order (ordonanta) in which he authorised the intervention of three undercover agents, namely D.D., N.A. and L.C., who were mandated to purchase 6,000 Ecstasy pills with the assistance of S.R.B. The justification given for such an intervention was that, based on S.R.B.’s statements, there existed a strong indication that individuals as yet unknown to the police intended to commit the offence of drug trafficking. The undercover agents were necessary in the operation because the individuals in question “belonged to a drug-dealing network which acted very cautiously, taking a lot of precautions in their activities and relying exclusively on highly trustworthy persons”.\\nOn the same date, the prosecutor authorised the undercover agents N.A. and L.C. to be provided with 35,000 euros (EUR), to be taken from the special funds of the police, with the purpose of using it to purchase the drugs.', '8.  On the night of 9 to 10 November 2007 the applicants entered Romania and met S.R.B. in a petrol station in Timişoara. Subsequently, they requested to be directed to a mechanical workshop, where they asked to be left alone. S.R.B. was asked to wait for their phone call before returning to the garage with the money for the drugs.', '9.  The applicants’ activity of removing the drugs from hidden compartments under the front passenger seat of the vehicle was video recorded by the investigators, based on an authorisation issued by the court on 25 October 2007.\\nAfter more than an hour, the applicants called S.R.B. to return to the garage together with the buyers, who were the undercover agents. One of them, N.A., handed over EUR 35,000, and the second applicant verified the authenticity of some of the bank notes with a special pencil.\\nAt the same time, the applicants presented the drugs, packed in zip-locked plastic bags, to the undercover agents. The investigators then intervened in order to ensure that the applicants were caught in flagrante delicto.', '10.  On the same day the applicants were placed in custody in the detention facility of the Timiş police station, in connection with drug-trafficking charges.', '11.  In his statement given before the prosecutor on 10 November 2007, the first applicant declared that he and the second applicant had come to Romania for personal reasons, namely to visit relatives. He claimed that they had intended to spend the night at the home of S.R.B., a friend of theirs, and that they had no knowledge of the content of the plastic bags found in the garage.\\nThe second applicant refused to give any statements, claiming that he was overwhelmed by the situation.\\nOn 5 December 2007 the first applicant specified before the prosecutor that when they had been in the garage, the two individuals who had entered with S.R.B. had taken some plastic bags out of another car that was parked in the garage, and had placed them on a table. A third person who had come in later had taken out some money and asked him and the second applicant to count it, without indicating why.', '12.  In his statement given before the prosecutor on 10 November 2007 in the presence of his lawyer, S.R.B. admitted that he had agreed to cooperate with the police in order to benefit from the provisions of Law no. 143/2000 granting certain benefits to those who contributed to or facilitated the identification of perpetrators of crime; he had therefore told the police that he had knowledge of a group of people who was involved in the international trafficking of Ecstasy pills. With the permission of the prosecutor, he then contacted the first applicant on the phone; the latter agreed to bring to Romania 5,000 Ecstasy pills for the price of 40,000 EUR. Several other phone calls were made in order to arrange the details of the transaction, which took place on the night of 9 to 10 November. S.R.B. confirmed that the phone calls and his being taken out of custody for the operation had been approved by the prosecutor.', '13.  On 6 March 2008 the applicants and S.R.B., were charged with drug-related offences.', '14.  During the proceedings before the first-instance court, namely until the hearing of 4 February 2009 (see paragraph 16 below), the applicants pleaded not guilty, claiming that they had had no knowledge of the plastic bags, which they believed had been placed in the garage by the three persons who had accompanied S.R.B., in order to set them up.\\nUp until the same hearing, S.R.B., legally assisted by Mr Fanu Moca Adrian and his substitute lawyer, Mr S.D., maintained the statements he had given before the investigating authorities.', '15.  At the hearing of 16 October 2008 the court watched the video recordings made on the night of 9 to 10 November 2007, in the presence of the applicants, S.R.B. and their respective lawyers. The recordings were not contested and their authenticity was not questioned.', '16.  At the hearing of 4 February 2009, the applicants, then represented by lawyer S.D., changed their plea and claimed that they had been pushed to commit the offence by the investigators, who had acted as agents provocateurs. They invoked in their defence the Court’s case-law in relation to police entrapment, namely Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal (9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV) and Ramanauskas v. Lithuania ([GC], no. 74420/01, ECHR 2008).\\nThe applicants contended that they had first declined S.R.B.’s proposal, but had finally agreed to deliver the drugs to Romania in order to help S.R.B., who had claimed that he had been facing financial difficulties. The first applicant stated that he had been called by S.R.B. on a daily basis for one month. Each time he had refused S.R.B.’s proposal, and each time the latter had increased his offer, namely from 3 euros per pill initially to the final price of 8 euros per pill.\\nAt the same hearing, S.R.B. also changed his statement and alleged that he had been coerced by the police to act as he had. He stated that during the telephone negotiations, the investigating authorities had asked him to increase both the quantity of pills requested and their price so that the first applicant would accept the transaction. He claimed that he had known the applicants as drug consumers, but not as drug dealers. He mentioned that some of the conversations he had had with the first applicant on a mobile phone had been recorded.', '17.  On 19 March 2009 the Timiş District Court sentenced the applicants to fifteen years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking. In its ruling, the court relied on the video recordings made on the day on which the applicants had been caught red-handed by Timiş police officers, as well as on the statements given by witnesses, including S.R.B. and the undercover agents.\\nThe court ruled that the procedure used by the applicants to conceal the drugs showed that they were experienced in international trafficking of narcotic drugs and had sought to make a significant profit, while the operation to catch them red-handed could not be considered as entrapment. The court found that the method used by the applicants to hide the drugs in the cavities of the front passenger seat of the vehicle and the large quantity of drugs that they managed to transport across several borders showed that they were not unfamiliar with drug trafficking.\\nThe court held that S.R.B.’s change of testimony could not be taken into account, as there was no other evidence to corroborate it and it contradicted his previous testimonies.', '18.  The applicants appealed against that judgment.', '19.  On 18 June 2009 the Timişoara Court of Appeal heard the applicants and S.R.B. They all maintained their previous statements according to which S.R.B., coerced by the police, had incited the applicants to commit the crime.', '20.  At the hearing, the applicants also submitted a request that the prosecution make available the recordings of the telephone conversations between S.R.B. and the first applicant, or at least a list of those conversations and of the telephones used. The applicants argued that the recordings proved on the one hand that S.R.B. had been coerced to cooperate with the police and on the other hand that there had been a high degree of incitement in the negotiations in order to persuade them to accept the deal.\\nThe court allowed the request.\\nOn 14 July 2009 the prosecutor’s office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice submitted that such recordings did not exist because the court had not been requested to authorise the recording of the phone conversations. Furthermore, according to the indictment, it was S.R.B. who had asked to be allowed to contact the applicants, under the supervision of the prosecutor, in order to take advantage of the lenient conditions prescribed in section 16 of Law no. 143/2000.', '21.  By its judgment of 21 October 2009, the appellate court upheld the lower court’s judgment.\\nThe court stated that the authorities had been legally entitled to bring to the attention of S.R.B. the benefits of cooperating with the police by virtue of section 16 of Law 143/2000, a reduction of his sentence.\\nThe applicants’ allegation that they had been entrapped was refuted by the court, which noted that the international case-law they had invoked was not applicable. In the case of Teixeira, the undercover agent and the collaborator had dealt with the applicant in person, while in Ramanauskas the applicant had been contacted by the agent claiming to be an acquaintance of the collaborator, whereas in the present case the applicants had never been contacted by the undercover agents, since S.R.B. had taken the initiative to ask to be allowed to make contact with the applicants in order to benefit from section 16 of Law no. 143/2000.\\nFurthermore, in the present case the applicants had freely chosen to travel to Romania with the drugs. Nothing had prevented them from refusing S.R.B.’s proposal.', '22.  The applicants further appealed against that judgment. They maintained before the High Court of Cassation and Justice that they had been entrapped, having been incited to sell drugs by S.R.B. He in turn had been forced to incite them to do so by the investigators, who had promised him a reduction in his sentence.\\nThe applicants also denounced the use of the undercover officer N.A., who had sought, through S.R.B., to purchase the drugs.', '23.  By a judgment of 28 January 2010, the High Court of Cassation and Justice, taking into account as a mitigating factor the applicants’ lack of a previous criminal record, partly allowed the appeal and reduced their sentences to seven years’ imprisonment. The High Court upheld the lower courts’ reasoning in dismissing the entrapment pleas. It held that S.R.B., interested in the reduction of his sentence, had collaborated with the police and contacted the applicants in order to buy drugs; however, the applicants had had the opportunity to refuse the transaction proposed by him. Therefore, the court considered that the applicants’ pleas of entrapment were unfounded.', '24.

According to the Government, the applicants were placed in separate cells measuring 12 square metres, which they shared with five other inmates.\\nOn 11 March 2008 the applicants were transferred to Timişoara Prison.

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Pyatigorsk, the Stavropol Region.', '6.  On 29 September 2002 a certain Ms Sh. was murdered. On the next day the police initiated criminal proceedings in that connection.', '7.  On the same day a certain Mr M., who had been arrested for the administrative offence of public drunkenness, complained to the police that the day before the applicant had allegedly sworn at him and attempted to start a fight.', '8.  On 2 October 2002 an administrative offence record was drawn up in respect of the applicant by police officers K. and B. The applicant denied Mr M.’s allegations.', '9.  On 3 October 2002 he was found guilty of disorderly conduct and sentenced to five days’ administrative detention by the Justice of the Peace of the 1st Circuit of the Kirovskiy District of the Stavropol Region.', '10.  On 3 October 2002, pursuant to the aforementioned judgment of the same date, the applicant was placed in the temporary holding facility of the Kirovskiy District Police Department of the Stavropol Region (“the district police department”).', '11.  According to the applicant, between 3 and 6 October 2002 police officers forced him to confess to the murder of Ms Sh. by beating him up and threatening him with rape with a rubber truncheon.', '12.  On 6 October 2002 the applicant signed a confession to the murder of Ms Sh. He stated, in particular, that he had strangled her with a TV power cable.', '13.  On 7 October 2002 the investigator in charge recorded the applicant’s arrest on suspicion of murder.', '14.  The investigator also ordered a forensic medical examination of the applicant, which was carried out on 7 October 2002 by a medical expert with ten years’ experience, who certified that he had no injures (certificate no. 181).', '15.  On 8 October 2002 the Kirovskiy District Court of the Stavropol Region (“the District Court”) ordered the applicant’s placement in custody as a preventive measure, stating that he was suspected of having committed a particularly serious criminal offence, might abscond from justice and had been given negative character references at the place of his residence. The applicant was then transferred to the remand centre “SIZO-26/2” of Pyatigorsk.', '16.  On 9 October 2002 the applicant was formally charged with murder.', '17.  On 6 December 2002 the District Court extended the term of the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 7 January 2003. The applicant’s counsel argued that there were no grounds to believe that the applicant might abscond, that he had a permanent place of residence and permanent work and had confessed to the crime. The fact that he was accused of a serious criminal offence could not, as such, be the basis for his continued pre-trial detention. The court decision read as follows:\\n“Bearing in mind that it is impossible to complete the pre-trial investigation within two months ... there are no grounds to change or quash the preventive measure [with regard to the applicant], considering that [the applicant] is charged with a particularly serious crime associated with a high risk to society, which does not exclude the possibility of him absconding from the investigating bodies and the court, the judge finds it necessary to grant the investigator’s request for the extension of the term of detention ...”\\nThe applicant did not appeal against that decision.', '18.  On 27 December 2002 the applicant requested the investigator to exclude his self-incriminating statements of 6 October 2002 from the body of evidence, alleging that he had confessed to the murder under physical and psychological pressure by the police officers during his administrative detention. The applicant alleged that every night they had taken him out of his cell to their office and had psychologically pressurised him to confess.', '19.  On 30 December 2002 the District Court examined the investigator’s application for the extension of the applicant’s detention. The applicant stated that he had no intention of absconding or influencing witnesses and asked to be released. The court extended the term of his pre-trial detention until 7 February 2003 for the following reasons:\\n“Bearing in mind that it is impossible to complete the pre-trial investigation within two months ... there are no grounds to change or quash the measure of restraint [with regard to the applicant], considering that [the applicant] is charged with a particularly serious crime, and might impede a thorough, comprehensive and objective investigation or abscond from the investigating bodies, the judge finds it necessary to grant the investigator’s request for the extension of the term of detention ...”\\nIt does not appear that the applicant appealed against this decision.', '20.  On 31 January 2003 the applicant was served with a copy of the bill of indictment for the murder.', '21.  On 6 February 2003 the case was sent to the District Court for trial.', '22.  Upon receipt of the case file, on 6 February 2003 the District Court scheduled a preliminary hearing for 17 February 2003. It also ordered that the preventive measure of detention should remain unchanged. It does not appear that the applicant appealed against this decision.', '23.  On 19 May 2003 the District Court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. It relied, in particular, on his self-incriminating statements. It took into account statements by the police officers, who denied ill-treating the applicant, and the medical expert report, according to which the applicant’s examination on 7 October 2002 had not revealed any injuries on him, and dismissed the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment as unsubstantiated.', '24.  On 20 July 2003 the applicant’s counsel obtained written statements from a certain Mr I. Sh. who stated that he had been detained in the same cell as the applicant in the temporary holding facility of the district police department from 3 to 5 October 2002. He stated that the applicant had been taken out of his cell in the night. After his return the applicant had told him that the police officers had beaten him up and that they had threatened him with rape with a rubber truncheon.', '25.  On 31 July 2003 the Regional Court examined the applicant’s appeal against his conviction. It found that the evidence on which the judgment was based contained a number of discrepancies which had not been resolved by the trial court and that the failure to summon witnesses for the applicant properly had undermined the adversarial nature of the trial. It also held that the applicant’s allegations that his self-incriminating statements had been obtained under duress had not been thoroughly examined; that the police officers’ statements did not constitute sufficient evidence of their proper conduct; and that the applicant’s counsel’s complaint to the prosecutor’s office of the Kirovskiy District (“the district prosecutor’s office”) about the unlawful acts of the police had been left unanswered and no inquiry in that connection had been conducted. The Regional Court thus quashed the judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination by the first-instance court. It also ordered that the applicant remain in custody.', '26.  On 11 August 2003 the case file arrived at the District Court.', '27.  On 12 August 2003 the District Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention until 6 November 2003, stating that the applicant was charged with a particularly serious criminal offence and that, if released, he might impede the criminal proceedings or evade trial. It also noted that the case had been before the courts for more than six months; that the initial term of the applicant’s detention established in Article 255 § 2 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure had expired and that it should be extended for the next three months. The applicant, who was neither present nor represented at the hearing, did not appeal against this decision.', '28.  On 12 September 2003 the applicant’s lawyer obtained further written statements from Mr I. Sh., who stated that he had been detained in the same cell as the applicant in the temporary holding facility of the district police department in October 2002. The applicant had been taken out of his cell in the night. After his return the applicant had told him that the police officers had beaten him in the area of the kidneys and liver. Mr I. Sh. further stated that he had seen fresh scratches on the applicant’s left shoulder and elbow and that the applicant’s lower lip had been hurt.', '29.  On 6 November 2003 the District Court rejected the applicant’s request for release under an undertaking not to leave a specified place and, with reference to Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, extended his detention for three months until 6 February 2004 on the same grounds as those given in its decision of 12 August 2003. The applicant’s lawyers referred to the length of detention, the applicant’s innocence and the deterioration of his health. The applicant appealed against the decision, arguing, in particular, that it was insufficiently reasoned.', '30.  On 10 December 2003 the Regional Court quashed the decision of 6 November 2003, referring to the absence of a transcript of that hearing in the materials of the case, and remitted the matter to the same court for a fresh examination.', '31.  On 8 January 2004 the District Court ordered, under Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, that the term of the applicant’s detention be extended until 6 February 2004. It relied on the same reasons as those which were set out in the decision of 12 August 2003. The applicant’s lawyers referred to the absence of reasons for the applicant’s continued detention, in particular the lack of grounds for the risk of him absconding, his permanent place of residence and work, positive references and the length of his detention. The court stated that at that stage it could not take into account the argument concerning the applicant’s innocence. It did not address any other arguments put forward by the applicant’s lawyers. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.', '32.  On 5 February 2004 the District Court again examined the question of the preventive measure applied to the applicant. The applicant asked to be released, referring to the deterioration of his health and stomach complaints. His lawyers referred to the excessive length of his detention, the absence of reasons to believe that he might abscond or otherwise impede the proceedings and the fact that he had received positive character references. The court dismissed their request for release and extended, on the basis of Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant’s detention for a further three months, until 6 May 2004, for reasons identical to those cited in its previous decisions. It did not address the applicant’s lawyers’ arguments. It does not appear that the applicant appealed against that decision.', '33.  On 22 March 2004 the applicant’s father’s flat was searched. The applicant’s father’s complaints about the unlawfulness of the search were dismissed by the district prosecutor’s office on 13 April 2004 and by the District Court on 14 May 2004.', '34.  On 26 April 2004 the District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. It examined, in particular, witness I. Sh. (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above) who stated before the court that the applicant had not complained about any ill-treatment by the police officers and that he had not seen any injures on the applicant. According to Mr I. Sh., his previous statements to the contrary had been false and had been given at the request of the applicant’s parents and defence counsel in order to help the applicant. Two other witnesses, Mr R. and Mr S., who had also been held in the applicant’s cell at some point in October 2002, also stated that they had neither heard from the applicant about any pressure by the police nor seen any injures on him.', '35.  On appeal, on 3 August 2004 the Regional Court found that the trial court had failed to assess the arguments put forward by the defence properly and that the applicant’s right to defend himself had been violated. It quashed the judgment of 26 April 2004 and remitted the case to the District Court for a fresh examination. The Regional Court also ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand as a preventive measure remain unchanged.', '36.  On 18 August 2004 the case file arrived at the District Court.', '37.  On 23 August 2004 the District Court scheduled a preliminary hearing in the case for 1 September 2004. It also ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant in the form of detention on remand remain unchanged. It does not appear that the applicant appealed against that decision.', '38.  On 1 September 2004 the District Court extended, with reference to Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the term of the applicant’s detention for three months, to be calculated from 13 August 2004 until 13 November 2004. The court noted that the term of the applicant’s detention, as previously extended on 5 February 2004 (see paragraph 32 above), had expired on 13 August 2004, and that it had received the case file from the Regional Court only on 18 August 2004. The applicant requested the court to release him, referring to the deterioration of his state of health and his stomach ulcer. The court held as follows:\\n“... the accused ... is charged with a particularly serious crime; the circumstances of the case were not ... established in detail ... in the course of the trial, the evidence which could have determined [his] guilt [or innocence] was not examined ...\\nThe positive character references of the accused ... do not constitute sufficient grounds to release him ... because, if released, he might abscond ... and hinder the establishment of the truth in the case.\\nThe court cannot take into account ... the claim that the accused is ill and needs medical treatment as he has not submitted any relevant documents.\\nThe court has not established any procedural violations in respect of his detention on remand.”', '39.  The applicant and his counsel appealed against the decision of 1 September 2004, arguing that the previously authorised term of the applicant’s detention had expired on 13 August 2004 and had not been extended by the court. According to them, the applicant had therefore been detained unlawfully for 18 days from 13 August to 1 September 2004.', '40.  On 17 September 2004 the Regional Court upheld the decision of 1 September 2004 on appeal. It stated that the fact that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious criminal offence had rightly been taken into account by the first-instance court; that the applicant’s state of health did not preclude his being kept in custody and that there had, therefore, been sufficient reasons for extending his detention.', '41.  On 1 November 2004 and 26 January 2005 the District Court further extended the term of the applicant’s detention on remand until 13 February and 13 May 2005 respectively. In its similar decisions the court relied on the same reasons to justify the applicant’s continued detention as those set out in the decision of 1 September 2004. The applicant did not appeal against either of those two decisions.', '42.  On 25 April 2005 the District Court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. During the hearing witness I. Sh. (see paragraphs 24, 28 and 34 above) stated that the applicant had sometimes been taken out of his cell for interrogation after 10 p.m., that he had seen a scratch on the applicant’s lip and that the applicant had told him that he had been beaten up. According to Mr I. Sh., he did not remember whether there had been other injuries on the applicant. Mr I. Sh. also stated that he had lived at the applicant’s parents’ home for several days and had done some work for them and that the applicant’s family had supported him when he had been detained in the context of another criminal case.', '43.  On 22 September 2005 the Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the District Court for a fresh examination. It found, in particular, that the first-instance judgment was based on conflicting evidence. It also held that the preventive measure should remain in place as there were no grounds to release the applicant.', '44.  On 11 October 2005 the case file arrived at the District Court.', '45.  On 26 October 2005 the District Court held a preliminary hearing in the case for the purpose of taking a decision on the preventive measure to be applied in respect of the applicant. The applicant requested the court to replace his detention with any preventive measure other than deprivation of liberty. His counsel requested that the preventive measure be changed to an undertaking not to leave a specified place and an undertaking of good behaviour, since the applicant had been held in custody for more than three years, had positive character references and did not intend to evade the trial. The prosecutor asked for the preventive measure to remain the same.', '46.  The District Court noted that the applicant’s criminal case had been pending before the court since 6 February 2003, and that from that date onwards his detention had been regulated by Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, which allowed it to be extended beyond the initial six-month period for further periods of three months. It further noted that the term of the applicant’s detention had been extended on numerous occasions, and that the last time, on 26 January 2005, the District Court had authorised his detention until 13 May 2005. It also noted that before the expiry of that period, on 25 April 2005, the applicant had been convicted by the trial court. The court then noted that the term of the applicant’s detention, as extended on 26 January 2005, should be considered as having run out on 9 October 2005, provided that the period between 25 April 2005, the date of the conviction, and 22 September 2005, the date of its quashing on appeal, was excluded from the term of detention on remand, in accordance with paragraph 26 of resolution no. 1 of the Supreme Court of Russia dated 5 March 2004. The court thus held that the term of the applicant’s detention had not been extended in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and that therefore, despite the seriousness of the charge against him, there were no legal grounds for his further detention on remand. It ordered that the preventive measure be changed to an undertaking not to leave a specified place and an undertaking of good behaviour and that the applicant be released immediately.', '47.  On 3 November 2005 the prosecutor appealed against that decision, arguing that the District Court had erred in its interpretation of paragraph 26 of resolution no. 1 of the Supreme Court of Russia dated 5 March 2004, since it followed from the meaning of Article 255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure that the term of detention should run from the day of a criminal case’s arrival at a first-instance court and not from the day of delivery of an appellate court’s decision. Therefore, in the prosecutor’s opinion, the term of the applicant’s detention should have run out on 29 October 2005. The applicant disagreed, pointing out the fact that he was employed, that he did not intend to evade justice and that he simply wanted the trial to be concluded as soon as possible and his good name restored.', '48.  On 30 November 2005 the Regional Court found that the District Court had violated Article 255 § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, as the term of detention of a person who had committed a serious or particularly serious criminal offence had to be extended by a court decision each time, and such extension could not be authorised for a period longer than three months at any one time. It went on to agree with the prosecutor’s submissions and stated that the term of the applicant’s detention should have started running on 11 October 2005, the date when the case file had been received by the District Court, and that therefore it should be regarded as having expired on 29 October 2005. The court then held that this procedural breach was grounds for the annulment of the decision of 26 October 2005, and ordered that the case be sent to the District Court for a new examination. According to the applicant, he attended the hearing of 30 November 2005 and was placed in detention immediately after that hearing.', '49.  On 21 December 2005 the District Court ordered the applicant’s release on an undertaking not to leave his place of residence. It stated that the applicant had been held in detention on remand for more than three years, that after his release on 26 October 2005 he had immediately started working and that he had been given positive character references from his employers. The court held that there were no reasons to believe that he would evade the trial or put pressure on witnesses and thus obstruct the establishment of the truth, and therefore there were no grounds to keep him in detention. The applicant was released immediately.', '50.  On 2 May 2006 the District Court examined the criminal case against the applicant for the fourth time. At the hearing, the applicant insisted that he was innocent and reiterated that he had made his confession at the pre-trial stage because he had been beaten and threatened by the police.', '51.  The District Court observed that the charge against the applicant had mainly been based on his self-incriminating statements and written confession made during the preliminary investigation, which he had later repudiated as having been made under duress. It further noted, as regards the applicant’s medical examination on 7 October 2002, which had not revealed any injuries on him, that the applicant had not been apprised of the investigator’s order to carry out that examination until it had been over. Therefore, in the District Court’s opinion, a note on the resulting expert report to the effect that the applicant had had no comments or questions for the expert, and had not wished to call into question the expert’s authority, was devoid of any legal meaning.', '52.  The court further stated that on 6 February 2006 the decision of 27 January 2003, by which the district prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment during his administrative detention in October 2002, had been quashed, and that on 15 February 2006 the district prosecutor’s office had again refused to institute criminal proceedings owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence in the police officers’ actions. In the District Court’s opinion, however, the applicant’s allegation that he had made self-incriminating statements and had signed his confession as a result of coercion by the police was corroborated by the evidence in the case.', '53.  In particular, the court examined the register of detainees of the temporary holding facility where the applicant had been held and noted that the applicant had been taken out of his cell on 3 October 2002, from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., and on 4 October 2002 from 6.25 p.m. to 6.50 p.m. and from 9.40 p.m. to 9.55 p.m. The court further observed that, according to the applicant’s written confession, it had been given on 6 October 2002 in office no. 36 of the temporary holding facility and not in his cell. However, the register did not contain any records confirming that he had been taken out of his cell on that day. Therefore, the District Court doubted the reliability of the official records. It found that the applicant’s confession could not be regarded as having been given voluntarily and was therefore inadmissible as evidence.', '54.  The District Court also noted that, when the applicant had been interviewed as a suspect on 7 and 9 October 2002, he had not been warned that his statements could be used as evidence, in breach of the domestic law. Having examined the body of evidence in the case, the District Court further stated that it had been contradictory in a number of aspects. In particular, a report on the medical forensic examination of Ms Sh.’s body had attested to the presence of numerous internal injuries. The investigating authorities, however, had never attempted to establish the circumstances in which the victim had sustained those injuries, and the applicant had never admitted inflicting any such injuries on the victim, simply having confessed to having strangled her (see paragraph 12 above). In this respect the District Court noted that, as was clear from the materials of the case, at the time when the applicant had made his self-incriminating statements and signed his confession, the aforementioned expert examination had not yet been carried out and the investigating authorities had not known of the existence of those injuries.', '55.  The court further listed a number of other shortcomings in the preliminary investigation and discrepancies in the adduced evidence. It found it unproven that the applicant had committed the imputed offence. The court thus acquitted the applicant and acknowledged his right to rehabilitation.', '56.  On 4 July 2006 the Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. It agreed with the trial court’s finding that the confession had been signed as a result of coercion by the police officers. The court noted in this respect that the very fact that the applicant had been taken out of his cell in breach of relevant regulations had been the proof of coercion, and therefore the arguments of the prosecuting party in the appeal submissions to the effect that the trial court had failed in its judgment to specify the methods of that coercion and to identify those responsible were unfounded. It also agreed with the trial court that the applicant’s self-incriminating statements, which he had later repudiated, had contradicted the other evidence in the case.', '57.  On 24 January 2003 the applicant’s counsel lodged a complaint with the district prosecutor’s office about the applicant’s ill-treatment by the police officers from the district police department. An inquiry was carried out in connection with that complaint. Several police officers were questioned. They all denied the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment.', '58.  On 27 January 2003 the district prosecutor’s office decided, relying on their statements and medical expert certificate no. 181 of 7 October 2002, to dispense with criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment owing to the absence of evidence that any crime had been committed. The applicant did not appeal against the decision in court.', '59.  On 4 December 2003 the district prosecutor’s office received a complaint from the applicant’s mother about alleged ill-treatment of the applicant by the officers of the district police department.', '60.  On 5 December 2003 a decision not to prosecute the police officers was taken. The Court has not been furnished with a copy of that decision. It does not appear that the applicant attempted to challenge the decision in question before a court.', '61.  On 11 August 2005 the district prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 5 December 2003 and ordered an additional inquiry.', '62.  During that inquiry Mr A., the head of the investigation department, responsible for the investigation of Ms Sh.’s murder at the time of the events in question, and Mr Z., deputy head of the temporary holding facility of the district police department at the material time, were interviewed. They stated that no physical or psychological pressure had ever been exercised on the applicant and that the applicant had voluntarily confessed to the murder and later confirmed his self-incriminating statements during an interview in the presence of his lawyer.', '63.  On 18 August 2005 the district prosecutor’s office, with reference to the aforementioned statements of Mr A. and Mr Z., decided not to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant’s allegations owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence in the police officers’ actions. The applicant did not appeal against that decision in court.', '64.  On 6 February 2006 the prosecutor’s office of the Stavropol Region quashed the decisions of 27 January 2003 and 18 August 2005 as unlawful and unfounded in view of the investigating authorities’ failure to establish all the relevant facts. In particular, it pointed out that the applicant had not been questioned; that the materials of the inquiry lacked an extract from the official records of requests for medical aid in the period from 3 to 6 October 2002; that the register of detainees of the temporary holding facility, where the applicant had been held during the relevant period, had not been examined with a view to establishing when and by whom the applicant had been taken out of his cell(s) for interrogation and to identifying who had been in the cell(s) with him so that they could be questioned in respect of his allegations; that a police officer who had been present when the applicant had signed his confession had not been questioned in that connection; that another police officer who had drawn up the administrative offence record in respect of the applicant had not been questioned in that connection; and that Mr R. and Mr S., who had allegedly shared a cell with the applicant, had not been interviewed either. The district prosecutor’s office was thus ordered to eliminate those defects in the course of an additional inquiry.', '65.  In a decision of 15 February 2006 the district prosecutor’s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers owing to the absence of the constituent elements of a crime in their actions.', '66.  According to the decision, when interviewed during an additional inquiry, the applicant had stated that on 2 October 2002 he had been taken from his home to a police station where he had met police officers G. and B. The latter had drawn up, on Mr G.’s instructions, an administrative offence record which stated that that the applicant had used obscene language in public. The applicant had been held at the police station from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and then transported to the district police department. On 3 October 2002 he had been placed under administrative arrest for five days and placed in the temporary holding facility of the district police department. Each night the officers of the Kirovskiy district police department, Mr A. and Mr G., had taken him to an office on the third floor in which they had subjected him to psychological pressure. On 6 October 2002, because of that pressure, he had been compelled to make a written confession to the murder of Ms Sh., which had been dictated to him by Mr G.', '67.  The decision went on to quote police officer A., who had stated that he had been present when his subordinates, Mr P. and Mr G., had interviewed the applicant. No physical or other form of coercion had been used on the applicant, who had voluntarily confessed to the murder and then confirmed his statements in the presence of his counsel.', '68.  Mr Z., deputy head of the temporary holding facility of the district police department at the material time, had stated that no force had ever been applied to the applicant, who had made no complaints during his detention in that facility. Mr Z. also stated that the applicant, Mr R. and Mr S. had never been held in the same cell at the same time.', '69.  Mr G. had stated that on 6 October 2002 he had been told that the applicant wished to see him. He had met the applicant at the temporary holding facility. The applicant had told him that he had killed Ms Sh. and had voluntarily written out his confession.', '70.  Mr B. had stated that on 2 October 2002 Mr M. had complained to him that the applicant had sworn at him. He had drawn up an administrative offence record and sent it to the court.', '71.  Mr R., who had been detained in the temporary holding facility from 1 to 6 October 2002 for committing an administrative offence, had confirmed that he had shared a cell with the applicant and stated that the applicant had not made any complaints concerning the police officers who had questioned him. Mr S., another detainee during the relevant period, had also been interviewed but had not given any relevant information regarding the applicant’s allegations.', '72.  The decision then indicated that, according to the temporary holding facility records concerning medical aid, the applicant had never applied for medical assistance. Nor had he made any complaints concerning his health.', '73.  The decision further stated that, according to the temporary holding facility register of detainees, the applicant had been taken out of his cell on 4 October 2002 at 6.45 p.m. by Mr G. and brought back at 6.50 p.m.; on the same day he had been taken away at 9.40 p.m. by Mr P. and brought back at 9.55 p.m. On 7 October 2002 the applicant had been taken out of his cell from 9 a.m. until 6.15 p.m. for the examination of his statements on the scene of the crime. For the rest of the time the applicant had stayed in his cell.', '74.  The decision thus concluded that during the inquiry the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment had proved unfounded. The applicant did not appeal against that decision in court.'], 'applicants': ['CHUMAKOV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['145', '17', '19', '22', '27', '29', '31', '32', '37', '38', '39', '41']}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 14, 17, 22, 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 36], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [12, 14, 17, 22, 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 36], 'explained_indices': [34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 36, 61, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 60, 35, 69, 33, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 68, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 22, 8, 1, 0, 2, 10, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5, 9], 'explained_distances': [-0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.072712004, -0.10421017, -0.13872817, -0.15526631, -0.2808573, -0.3305221, -0.3404049, -0.35048392, -0.35464332, -0.37571695, -0.3909473, -0.39182076], 'number_of_sentences': 70, 'article_id': 8, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Tbilisi.', '6.  The applicant had served as a judge of the Supreme Court of Georgia since 1956, first when the country formed part of the Soviet Union and then after it became independent.', '7.  On 4 May 2000 the applicant retired on age grounds and was granted, under section 36 of the Act of 12 May 1999 on the Supreme Court of Georgia (“the Supreme Court Act”), a pension of 1,073 Georgian laris (GEL – 492 euros (EUR)[*].), corresponding to her final salary.', '8.  The original version of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, in force at the time of the applicant’s retirement, stated that, upon retirement, a Supreme Court judge was entitled to a life-long pension in an amount equal to his or her final salary and adjustable in line with changes in the salary scales of serving Supreme Court judges.', '9.  Section 36 of the Supreme Court Act was later amended on several occasions. Thus, by an amendment of 16 March 2001, its second clause concerning the adjustment requirement (“the adjustment clause”) was removed.', '10.  By an amendment of 10 March 2005, the adjustment clause was reintroduced to the Supreme Court Act in a slightly altered form, extending the adjustment benefit to cover, in addition to retired Supreme Court judges, those who agreed to relinquish office between 1 January and 31 December 2005, providing they had served for at least three years (sections 36 and 40(7) of the Act, as of 23 June 2005).', '11.  Finally, by an amendment of 23 December 2005, which entered into force on 1 January 2006, section 36 was rephrased as follows:\\n“A Supreme Court judge who has retired either on reaching pension age or on expiry of his or her term of office shall be entitled to State compensation in the amount of GEL 1,200 [EUR 551]”.', '12.  Section 40(7) of the Act, which was amended at the same time, stated that Supreme Court judges who had relinquished office between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2006 would receive State compensation in an amount equal to their final salary for the remainder of the term which they would have normally served if they had remained in office; after expiry of that term the compensation paid to judges who had resigned would be recalculated in accordance with the latest version of section 36.', '13.  Unlike previous amendments to that provision, the 23 December 2005 version of section 36 was given retroactive effect by virtue of section 40(7)(1), inserted in the Supreme Court Act on the same day.', '14.  On 3 September 2004 the applicant, dissatisfied with the procedure for payment of her pension, brought an action against the State seeking compensation for pecuniary damage, challenging, in particular, the lawfulness of the application of the amendment of 16 March 2001 to the Supreme Court Act. Relying on the original version of section 36 of the Act, she requested that her pension be adjusted in line with the Supreme Court judges’ pay rise which had occurred after her retirement, and that she be compensated for the resulting arrears. The Georgian State Social Insurance Fund (“the Fund”) was a respondent in the proceedings.', '15.  On 27 December 2004 the Krtsanisi-Mtatsminda District Court in Tbilisi allowed her claim in part, reasoning, inter alia, that the amendment of 16 March 2001 could not be given retroactive force under Article 6 of the Civil Code in so far as, by removing the adjustment clause, it worsened the applicant’s situation.', '16.  On 23 May 2005 the Tbilisi Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s decision, stating that there were no signs of a worsening of the applicant’s pre-existing situation.', '17.  Finally, in a judgment of 21 February 2006 following a cassation appeal, adopted by a majority vote, a three judge bench of the Administrative Division of the Supreme Court (“the majority”) quashed the appeal decision of 23 May 2005 and allowed the applicant’s claim in full.', '18.  At the outset, the majority noted that, in so far as the Fund had paid the applicant, by error, her January 2006 pension in an amount corresponding to the latest salary of a serving Supreme Court judge (GEL 3,000 – EUR 1,378), the applicant’s claim should be limited in time up to and including December 2005.', '19.  The majority then stated that the amendment of 16 March 2001 could not have retroactive force because it did not contain any indication to that effect as required by section 47(1) of the Act on Normative Acts (see 38 below). In the absence of such an explicit indication, it could not legitimately be inferred that the legislature had intended to deprive judges who had already retired of their “adjustment right” ex post facto; the respondent administrative authority’s decision to do so had therefore been arbitrary.', '20.  The majority also stated that, in so far as section 8 of the Act of 25 June 1996 on Supreme Court Judges’ Social Security Entitlements ruled out the possibility of a reduction in a Supreme Court judge’s salary, it was logical to assume that the adjustment clause was, in principle, meant to protect the right to an increase in pension.', '21.  The majority further ruled that, when deciding on a dispute, the courts must apply the statute in force at the time material to the critical event, even if the legal consequences of that event only emerged later under a different statutory regime. To hold otherwise, in the opinion of the cassation court, “would undermine legal certainty ... and ... allow the legislature’s arbitrariness to replace a stable legal order.” Despite the fact that the applicant’s pension rights were obviously of a continuous nature, those rights had arisen, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, as a result of the material fact of the applicant’s retirement in May 2000, when she had been granted a pension for life under the original version of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act.', '22.  In view of the above, the majority concluded that the impugned amendment of 16 March 2001 should apply only to those judges who had voluntarily relinquished office or retired on reaching pensionable age or on expiry of their term of office, and had thus acquired their pension rights after its entry into force. In no way could that amendment be understood to replace the original section 36 of the Supreme Court Act and to apply to retired judges who had already obtained their pension rights.', '23.  The majority also noted that the original version of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act set a very high standard of retirement benefit for Supreme Court judges. It stated in this regard that “the creation of generous pension benefits is not only a question of providing social protection for any particular retired judge, it also aims to maintain the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in general, by providing serving judges with the expectation of obtaining the same benefits upon their future retirement...”', '24.  One of the members of the Supreme Court, Judge S., expressed a dissenting opinion. He reasoned, in so far as relevant, that the removal of the adjustment clause from the original version of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act could not be said to have necessarily caused the applicant’s situation to deteriorate, as the pension might equally have been reduced and not just increased. Contrary to the majority’s opinion, he stated that section 8 of the Act of 25 June 1996 on Supreme Court Judges’ Social Security Entitlements had nothing to do with the protection of judges’ retirement pensions. As to the question whether a Supreme Court judge’s pension could be reduced, Judge S. replied in the affirmative, arguing that such a mechanism existed under section 81(4) of the Act on the Courts of Common Jurisdiction. In his opinion, the amendment of 16 March 2001 could be held applicable to the applicant’s situation because it did not affect her right to receive the pension as such, but simply redefined its amount.', '25.  Judge S. also stated that “neither the amendment of 16 March 2001 nor the amendment of 23 December 2005, which fixed the pension for judges who had already retired at GEL 1,200, breached ... the principle of legal certainty”. He concluded that the applicant’s pension should be adjusted in line with the Supreme Court judges’ pay rise only between 10 March 2005, when the adjustment clause had been reintroduced into section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, and 1 January 2006, when the ex post facto amendment of 23 December 2005 had entered into force.', '26.  The judgment of 21 February 2006 ordered the Fund to compensate the applicant for all the arrears accumulated as a result of the failure to adjust her pension in line with the Supreme Court judges’ pay rises up to and including December 2005, as required by the original version of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act.', '27.  The Fund discharged the judgment debt of 21 February 2006 in the applicant’s favour in due time.', '28.  With effect from February 2006, the Fund, relying on the amendment of 23 December 2005 to the Supreme Court Act, fixed the applicant’s pension at GEL 1,200 (EUR 551).', '29.  In view of the above, on 31 May 2006 the applicant brought another action for damages against the Fund, challenging the lawfulness of the application of the amendment of 23 December 2005 to her situation.', '30.  On 19 September 2006 the Tbilisi City Court dismissed the applicant’s action as manifestly ill-founded. Its reasons mostly corresponded to those given by Judge S. in his dissenting opinion on the judgment of 21 February 2006. The first-instance court added that the impugned amendment of 23 December 2005, unlike the previous amendments to section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, contained a clear indication of its retroactive effect and was, consequently, compatible with section 47(1) of the Act on Normative Acts.', '31.  The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of 19 September 2006, which was dismissed by the Tbilisi Regional Court on 6 March 2007. Referring to paragraphs 39 and 45 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland (no. 60669/00, ECHR 2004‑IX), the appellate court stated that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not guarantee the right to receive a pension of a particular amount. In reply to the applicant’s complaint that the first-instance court had disregarded the findings of the Supreme Court’s judgment of 21 February 2006, the Regional Court stated that the scope of that judgment had been limited to resolving her pension dispute arising out of the amendment of 16 March 2001; the judgment of 21 February 2006 had never addressed the issue of payment of her pension on the basis of the amendment of 23 December 2005.', '32.  On 9 July 2007 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the appellate judgment of 6 March 2007. Amongst other arguments, the applicant affirmed, referring to the case of Zielinski and Pradal and Gonzalez and Others v. France ([GC], nos. 24846/94 and 34165/96 to 34173/96, ECHR 1999‑VII), that legislative interference retroactively affecting a civil right was incompatible with the Convention. In support of the admissibility of her cassation appeal, the applicant, comparing the Supreme Court’s judgment of 21 February 2006 with the Tbilisi Regional Court’s judgment of 6 March 2007, pointed out that the two decisions had resolved an analogous situation differently, and argued that an examination of her cassation appeal on the merits was indispensable for the consistent development of the domestic case-law on the subject.', '33.  On 10 October 2007 a bench of the Administrative Division of the Supreme Court, composed of Judge S. (see paragraph 24 and 25 above) and two other judges who had not participated in the examination of the applicant’s first pension dispute, declared the cassation appeal of 9 July 2007 inadmissible. The decision was delivered without an oral hearing, under the written procedure. Without specifically addressing any of the applicant’s cassation arguments, the cassation court stated that none of the conditions of admissibility envisaged by the relevant provision of the General Administrative Code had been met.', '34.  The applicant then requested the setting-aside of the decision of 10 October 2007 on the basis of Article 422 § 1 (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. She complained that Judge S. should not have participated in the examination of her cassation appeal of 9 July 2007, in so far as he had already expressed his opinion on the same issue; that constituted a ground for his exemption or withdrawal under Articles 31 § 1 (d) and 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure.', '35.  In a final decision of 26 December 2007 the Supreme Court rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s request to have the impugned decision set aside. The fact that Judge S. had expressed a dissenting opinion on the judgment of 21 February 2006 could not, in the cassation court’s view, be accepted as evidence of bias, actual or implied, against the applicant.'], 'applicants': ['KHONIAKINA'], 'defendants': ['GEORGIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6', 'P1-1'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['46'], 'P1-1': ['11', '26', '39', '40', '47', '62', '68', '7']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 6, 21], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 6, 21], 'explained_indices': [1, 8, 15, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 30, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 29, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 5, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.025716543, 0.0028481483, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, 0.0020186305, -0.017311156, -0.02920276, -0.047386587, -0.07107383, -0.0860253, -0.09952068, -0.13773602], 'number_of_sentences': 31, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant, Mr Abdullah Yaşa (“A.Y.”), a Turkish national, was born in 1993 and lives in Diyarbakır. He was thirteen years old at the time of the events to which the present case relates.\\n A.  The 29 March 2006 incident', '6.  Following the deaths of fourteen members of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party) during an armed clash on 24 March 2006, numerous unlawful demonstrations took place in Diyarbakır between 28 and 31 March 2006, during which eleven demonstrators died. In particular, two persons, namely T. Atakkaya and M. Mızrak, were killed by tear-gas grenades in the course of these events.', '7.  On 29 March 2006 A.Y., who was at the scene of a demonstration, was injured in the nose by a tear-gas grenade fired by the police while he was allegedly on his way to his aunt’s house. He was taken to the Diyarbakır public hospital the same day.', '8.  On 5 April 2006 A.Y. left hospital, where he had undergone an operation for a maxillo-facial trauma on the day of his arrival, according to the discharge report.', '9.  On 14 April 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Diyarbakır public prosecutor’s office (the “public prosecutor’s office”) against the police officers of the Diyarbakır security police headquarters, alleging assault and abuse of power. He explained that he had been hit directly on the nose by a tear-gas grenade.', '10.  On 2 August 2006 the public prosecutor’s office interviewed the applicant and his father and mother. A.Y.’s father said that he had been at work at the time of the incident and demanded the conviction of the police officers responsible for the assault on his son.', '11.  In her depositions the same day, A.Y.’s mother stated that she had been at home at the time of the incident, and she also demanded the conviction of the police officers responsible for her son’s injuries.', '12.  In substance, A.Y. himself testified as follows: while on his way to his aunt’s house he had been hit on the nose by an object as he was watching the police officers. At the time of the incident he had seen the helmeted police officers shooting a projectile in his direction by means of a shoulder-borne device. He had been unable to identify his exact position at the time of the incident, nor had he previously seen anyone throwing objects at the police officers. He did not think that the police officers could have shot at him without noticing his presence, since they had seen him when he had been in the street. He did not know the police officer who had shot at him. He requested the identification and punishment of this officer. He had been taken to hospital by a stranger.', '13.  His lawyer, having confirmed his statements, requested the formulation of a forensic report and the submission of medical reports from Diyarbakır public hospital. He also requested the identification of the police officers involved on the day of the incident.', '14.  On 6 November 2007 the public prosecutor’s office issued the following decision not to prosecute:\\n“... It emerged from the inquiries launched after the complaint ... that A.Y. had not been injured on his way to his aunt’s house. According to video recordings ... and photographs ... the complainant was injured during a demonstration in which he had been actively participating by chanting slogans in support of the PKK terrorist organisation and its leader Abdullah Öcalan, and throwing stones, sticks and Molotov cocktails at the police officers.\\nConsequently, the police officers were not criminally liable because they had acted in self-defence within the meaning of Article 25 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and in the exercise of their functions as set out in Article 24 of the same Code. [They] had shot tear-gas grenades in order to disperse the demonstrators who had gathered illegally and were attacking the officers by throwing stones, sticks and Molotov cocktails.\\nIn the light of the foregoing comments ... no action is required against the police officers accused of overstepping the bounds of the use of force ....”', '15.  On 13 November 2006 the Diyarbakır Department of Forensic Medicine issued a medical report reading as follows:\\n“... A.Y. underwent operations on a haemorrhage, a facial oedema, a fractured nose bone and a series of concave incisions.\\nConclusion:\\nThe patient cannot be treated by means of a straightforward operation,\\nHis condition is not life-threatening,\\nThe bone fractures constitute moderately severe damage to the applicant’s vital body functions.”', '16. On 3 December 2007 the applicant appealed to the Siverek Assize Court (“the Assize Court”) against the decision not to prosecute. He denied his alleged participation in the demonstration in question and argued that the video recordings and photographs on which the decision not to prosecute had been based in no way constituted sufficient evidence of such participation.', '17.  By a decision of 31 December 2007, served on the applicant on 10 March 2008, the President of the Assize Court dismissed the appeal. It considered that the police officers’ acts had remained within the framework of the law, since the officers had not acted intentionally but had merely endeavoured to discharge their duties.', '18.  It emerges from the case-file that an investigation was automatically launched in respect of the applicant for his alleged participation in an illegal demonstration. On 28 November 2007, as part of this investigation, he was questioned by the public prosecutor’s office. The relevant parts of his statements may be summarised as follows:\\n“I completely reject the charges levelled against me. [On the day of the incident] I had left home to visit my aunt, who lives in Bağlar, when I saw a group of police officers near the street where the clinic is located. The officers launched a tear-gas grenade, which hit me in the nose. I had eight days of medical treatment in hospital. I had been alone during this incident, I had not thrown any stones, sticks or Molotov cocktails at the police officers, I did not chant slogans supporting the terrorist organisation, and I reject the photographs taken, the video recordings and the police reports. I agree to have a medical check-up.”', '19.  On 25 February 2008 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on charges of membership of a terrorist organisation, propaganda in support of that organisation and resisting the police.', '20.  In his submissions on the merits of the case the public prosecutor sought the applicant’s acquittal for lack of evidence. He stressed in particular that it was not possible, on the basis of the images studied by the Ankara criminal police laboratory, to establish that the applicant had taken part in the demonstration in question.', '21.  On 10 July 2008, the Assize Court endorsed the prosecutor’s arguments and acquitted A.Y. According to the case file, in the absence of an appeal on points of law, that judgment became final.', '22.  During proceedings before the Court, the Government produced a CD-ROM containing a police video recording. The CD-ROM shows several phases of the demonstrations which took place in Diyarbakır on 29 March 2006, and contains images of the period before and after the launching of the tear-gas grenade which injured the applicant’s head. It also shows that most of the demonstrators were teenagers, some of them with their faces covered, who were throwing stones. Moreover, it is clear that the event took place on a very busy boulevard. Some sequences show the applicant among the demonstrators, although it cannot be clearly ascertained that he was taking part in the demonstration. In the course of the events it can be seen that the applicant has been hit by a tear-gas grenade. Although it is impossible to make out exactly how the police officer fired the tear-gas grenade, it would appear from its impact that it was a direct, flat-trajectory shot (that is, it had been fired horizontally, or else at an angle of under 45o), rather than a high-angle shot (where the launcher is aimed as high as possible so that the tear-gas grenades explode in the air and break up before falling back to earth, thus preventing injuries to demonstrators in the event of an impact).'], 'applicants': ['ABDULLAH YAŞA', 'OTHERS'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '8', '46'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['14', '19', '32'], '5': ['10']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 9, 14], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 9, 14], 'explained_indices': [6, 7, 2, 3, 8, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 17, 9, 16, 10, 5, 4, 1, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.008078575, 0.00369028, -0.0035700575, -0.00971736, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.011482343, -0.012325972, -0.031795874, -0.05119382, -0.05735497], 'number_of_sentences': 18, 'article_id': 4, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

At the time of the events the applicant was the principal of a high school in Chişinău.', '6.  According to the findings of the domestic courts, on an unspecified date, the applicant was contacted by C., who requested that a pupil be transferred to the high school the applicant was a principal of. Since the applicant requested a bribe in exchange for the pupil’s transfer, C. contacted the police and, on 14 January 2004, an undercover operation was organised. For that purpose C. was instructed to meet the applicant and give him money marked with a special dust.', '7.  C. contacted the applicant and they agreed to meet in the Chişinău central park. The scene was secretly observed by numerous police officers and filmed. However, later the police submitted that for technical reasons the actual transmitting of the bribe money had not been filmed. What had actually happened during the applicant’s meeting with C. was a matter of dispute during the criminal proceedings.', '8.  According to the police, the applicant and C. did not shake hands upon meeting each other and sat on a bench for several minutes. C. gave the applicant the bribe money by placing it in a file belonging to the applicant. When apprehended, the applicant dropped the file and all of its contents, including the money, were scattered on the ground. It was later discovered that the applicant had traces of the dust from the money on his fingers.', '9.  According to the applicant, he had been contacted by C. when going to the Ministry of Education and had agreed to meet him shortly afterwards in a park in the immediate vicinity to the Ministry. He shook hands with C. upon meeting him and, after a brief discussion, suggested they sit on a bench in order to be able to write. He placed his file between himself and C. and wrote on a sheet of paper a list of documents necessary for the pupil’s transfer. The applicant, who is missing an eye, did not see C. put the money into his file. When apprehended, he dropped the file. The bribe money was collected from the ground by a police officer, who later gave him a pen to sign the arrest report. The traces of dust on his hands must have come either from shaking hands with C. or from the pen with which he signed the minutes. The applicant alleged that he had been set up by the police.', '10.  According to the applicant, during the arrest the police officers used unjustified violence as a result of which he suffered pain in his wrists. Between 2004 and 2005 the Ministry of Internal affairs issued several press releases in which it was stated, inter alia, that the applicant had taken a bribe from a parent. Several media outlets, including the national television station, reported on this. It does not appear that the applicant initiated proceedings against any of the media outlets or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.', '11.  During the course of the proceedings the Buiucani District Court heard the applicant, seven prosecution witnesses and one forensic expert. The court also viewed the video of the undercover operation and examined other evidence, such as C.’s complaint to the police, the record of the marking of the bribe money with special dust, an expert report finding that following his apprehension the applicant had traces of the special dust on his fingers and a report concerning the search of the applicant’s office and home.', '12.  The court considered C.’s testimony to the effect that the applicant had requested a bribe from him to be unreliable. The court also noted that C. and four other prosecution witnesses, all of whom were police officers, gave different accounts of the moment of the applicant and C. had met and, in particular, of the manner in which the bribe money had been transmitted. In that respect the court noted that according to three witnesses the money had been inserted by C. into the applicant’s file, which had been placed on the bench between the two men, while according to another witness the money had been handed by C. directly to the applicant. One of the witnesses, who was positioned directly in front of C. and the applicant during the undercover operation, did not see the money being transmitted at all. The court also found contradictions in the accounts concerning the shaking of hands by the applicant and C. The court also noted that the video of the undercover operation had not been helpful because, for unknown reasons, the filming had been interrupted precisely during the meeting between the applicant and C.', '13.  In a judgment of 24 January 2006, relying on the above reasons, the Buiucani District Court acquitted the applicant. It concluded that the prosecution had failed to provide reliable evidence in support of the contention that the applicant had requested money from C. and that the applicant had been aware that C. had placed money in his file. In so far as the presence of traces of special dust on the applicant’s fingers was concerned, the court considered that it could not be ruled out that the traces appeared as a result of his shaking hands with C., picking up the money from the ground after apprehension or using a pen given to him by the police to sign the arrest report. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on an expert report stating that the special dust could have been transmitted in any of the above-mentioned ways.', '14.  The Prosecutor’s Office appealed against this judgment.', '15.  On 23 March 2006 the Chişinău Court of Appeal held a hearing at which the applicant, his representative and the prosecutor were present. The court upheld the appeal lodged by the prosecutor and reversed the judgment of the first-instance court. In so doing the Court of Appeal did not hear the witnesses anew but merely gave a different assessment to the testimonies given by them by the first-instance court. The Court of Appeal considered all the witness statements to be reliable and did not find any major contradictions between them.', '16.  The applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to a criminal fine of 60,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (approximately 3,350 euros (EUR)) and to five years’ imprisonment suspended for two years. The applicant was also prohibited from occupying any administrative post for a period of three years.', '17.  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment and argued that the witnesses on whose testimonies his conviction had been based were not credible. In particular, he submitted that C. was being investigated in two separate cases by the police station which had organised the undercover operation. He also submitted that all the prosecution witnesses had been police officers. One of those witnesses could not objectively have seen what had happened from the distance at which he was located because he had serious problems with his eyesight. The applicant also argued that the police had deleted a part of the video of the undercover operation because it was not favourable to the prosecution and submitted that he had been the victim of entrapment.', '18.  On 21 June 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice examined the applicant’s appeal in the absence of the parties and declared it inadmissible.', '19.  The applicant also lodged and extraordinary appeal with the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice in which he claimed a breach of Article 6 of the Convention. However, on 19 February 2007, the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal.'], 'applicants': ['DAN'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['13', '15', '21']}, 'silver_rationales': [8, 10], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [8, 10], 'explained_indices': [3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'explained_distances': [0.19360018, 0.18655956, 0.0746308, -0.023440242, -0.10194671, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474, -0.114474], 'number_of_sentences': 15, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

He lives in Bucharest.', '6.  On 21 November 2001 the Bucharest Appeal Court found the applicant guilty of robbery and two traffic offences and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment.', '7.  He started serving his sentence in Jilava Prison, where he was detained from 28 February 2001 to 4 March 2002; from 27 April 2002 to 23 January 2003; from 28 January to 3rd July 2003; and from 20 February 2006 to 4 December 2008. He also served a part of his sentence in Giurgiu prison from 3rd July 2003 to 26 February 2005; from 5 March 2005 to 11 February 2006; and from 25 February to 23 April 2009.', '8.  The further circumstances on the applicant’s conditions of detention are in dispute between the parties.', '9.  The applicant complained about the conditions of his detention, summarised below, in both Jilava and Giurgiu prisons.\\nHe regularly complained thereof and about the disciplinary measures taken against him to the delegate judge, who dismissed most of his complaints.\\nFor instance, in a decision of 23 March 2007, the delegate judge to Jilava Prison rejected the applicant’s complaints that he did not fully benefit from the rights granted to him by the Regulations implementing Law no. 275/2006, adopted by Decree no. 1897/2006, on the ground, inter alia, that the legal force of the regulations was inferior to that of the law, and that therefore the prison administration was under no obligation to grant detainees rights which were not provided for by Law no. 275/2006 itself.\\n(a)  Jilava Prison', '10.  The cell lacked basic hygiene, it was infested with lice, bugs and rats, the blankets were in a poor condition and the mattresses were dirty. Although the cell was very small and it was only big enough for two to three people, there were nine beds and twelve inmates in the cell (sometimes even fourteen to fifteen).', '11.  The cell window was very small and the cell lacked natural light. Due to the size of the window, the cell was not properly ventilated. The air was even more difficult to breathe as his cellmates were smokers, and the applicant was thus exposed to smoke almost all day long.', '12.  As the sanitary facilities were separated from the rest of the cell only by a makeshift partition, the smell was unbearable.', '13.  The water was undrinkable.', '14.  In addition, the applicant alleges that his daily walk schedule was not observed and that his access to cultural and educational activities was limited.\\n(b)  Giurgiu Prison', '15.  The conditions were similar to those in Jilava Prison: the cell was overcrowded and lacked basic hygiene; also, there were no educational and cultural activities and the walk schedule was not observed.', '16.  He was detained alone in a cell for more than eight months, from July 2003 to February/March 2004. During that period he had no contact with the outside world, his rights to receive visits or parcels and to make phone calls were heavily restricted, the window could not be opened and he could only go out for walks on the roof of the prison building, handcuffed, and in a group of no more than five or six prisoners.', '17.  On 19 March 2004 the applicant was categorised as “dangerous” and treated as such, including during his transfer from Jilava Prison to Giurgiu Prison. This measure was regularly renewed. However, the applicant considered that the decisions to categorise him as dangerous had lacked any factual basis and pointed out that since 29 March 2003 he had not committed any act of indiscipline and had integrated very well into prison life.', '18.  Being categorised as a dangerous prisoner had serious consequences. His rights to receive visits, parcels and correspondence were restricted, and sometimes even withdrawn.\\nThe applicant frequently had to file actions with the courts each time there was a restriction of his right to receive parcels and correspondence; most of his complaints about that were allowed by the domestic courts. However, the decision to categorise him as dangerous had other consequences: it prevented him from participating in a number of activities in the prison, and even restricted his movement; for instance, his hands were handcuffed behind his back whenever he was moved, which proved very painful.', '19.  Generally, the prison staff had a hostile attitude towards him.', '20.  On 4 July 2004 he was taken from Giurgiu Prison to Giurgiu County Court for a hearing. He did not receive any food or water until he was taken back to Giurgiu Prison.', '21.  The Government submitted in their observations that in general, the conditions in Jilava Prison were adequate. In 2001 and 2002 there had been a problem with the overcrowding of the cells, but as of 2003 the situation had improved, and in each cell the number of detainees corresponded to the number of beds at the most. Each cell had power supply, natural light and natural ventilation through the windows. In summer time, the cell doors remained open, being closed off only by grids for better ventilation.', '22.  Each cell was equipped with tables, chairs, benches and a hallstand. The cells were cleaned by the prisoners, the necessary materials being provided by the prison administration. Disinfestation services were provided by professionals at least once every three months. The sanitary facilities were cleaned every morning with disinfectants. Whenever necessary, the cells were cleaned with disinfectants. Every week, upon request, the clothing of the detainees was washed.', '23.  Drinking water was permanently available. The quality of the water was checked monthly by a company under contract with the prison administration; according to the reports of that company, the water was drinkable.', '24.  The applicant was detained in cells nos. 203, 304, 307, 210, 208, 405, 404, 401, 403, 412.\\nDuring 2001-2003 the applicant was entitled to a daily thirty-minute walk; after Law no. 275/2006 entered into force in July 2006, he was entitled to a three-hour walk. In 2006 and 2007 the applicant also took part in educative programmes.', '25.  The fact that the applicant was registered as a detainee with an increased degree of risk did not restrict his right to receive packages, visits, or correspondence; however, appropriate security measures were taken when granting these rights.\\nMoreover, the applicant complained dozens of times both about the security measures and the way they interfered with his rights, as well as about the improper conditions of his detention. The delegated judge often granted the applicant’s appeals concerning disciplinary sanctions against him. The appeals concerning his registration as dangerous and the material conditions of detention were dismissed, on the ground that no breach of law could be found. For instance, on 25 May 2007, the applicant’s complaints about the improper material conditions in his cell and about the lack of medical treatment by a dentist were dismissed by the delegate judge. He found, upon examination of the information submitted to him by Jilava Prison administration, that the conditions of the applicant’s detention did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and that, although there was no dentist in Jilava Prison, a competition for hiring a dentist in that prison was being organised by the Ministry of Justice. The delegated judge concluded that no breach of Law no. 275/2006 could be found.\\n(b)  Giurgiu Prison', '26.  The cells in the prison had two or six beds, and were equipped in compliance with the law. Each detainee had an individual bed and a bedroll.', '27.  The two-bed detention cells measured 10.24 square metres, access to natural light and ventilation through four windows, and were equipped with one sink with utensils, one television stand, one table, one 220V lamp and one night watch light.', '28.  The six-bed detention rooms measured 21.76 square metres, access to natural light and ventilation through six windows, and were equipped with one sink with utensils, one television stand, three tables, one bench, a hallstand, one 220V lamp and one night watch lamp.', '29.  The sanitary facility was separated from the detention room and conformed to hygiene standards and privacy requirements. The detention rooms and water for twice weekly baths were heated by the prison’s own power station. Drinking and non-drinking water was provided by the Giurgiu city supply network and was checked periodically.', '30.  The applicant was registered as a detainee with an increased degree of risk, and therefore security measures were taken when according his rights. For instance, his daily walk took place in one of the eight courtyards specially designed for very dangerous detainees, located on block C.', '31.  Between July 2003 and March 2004 the applicant was detained alone in a cell equipped in a similar way to the other cells. After March 2004 the applicant shared his cell with another detainee. The daily programme was respected by the prison administration, his rights to visits and packages were observed, and he was even able to participate in the football games organised by the penitentiary authorities.', '32.  The applicant’s registration as a detainee with an increased degree of risk was well-founded and repeatedly prolonged throughout his detention in Giurgiu Prison. The applicant complained dozens of times about his conditions of detention, including material conditions, lack of medical treatment and restrictions to his rights as a result of his registration as dangerous.\\nThe delegated judge often granted the applicant’s appeals concerning disciplinary sanctions against him. The appeals concerning his registration as dangerous and the material conditions of detention were dismissed, on the ground that no breach of law could be found.', '33.  The circumstances surrounding the events on 10 and 11 November 2005 are in dispute between the parties.', '34.  The applicant alleged that on 10 and 11 November 2005, while in Giurgiu Prison, he had been beaten by members of the Giurgiu Prison intervention squad wearing balaclavas. His requests to be examined by a forensic doctor immediately after the violent incidents had been ignored. He further alleged that he had immediately duly informed the prison authorities about the violent behaviour of the members of the intervention squad.', '35.  The Government submitted in their observations that on 10 November 2005, upon his return from a court hearing, the applicant had asked to be taken to the prison store room to pick up some personal effects. The officers had informed him that his request would be granted only after all the formalities applicable to detainees returning from court to their cells had been complied with. Unhappy that his request had not been granted immediately, the applicant had become violent, and while he was being taken to the detention room, he had managed to undo his handcuffs and hit C.C., one of the members of the intervention unit, in the face. The incident was settled calmly and the applicant was placed in his cell without further difficulty. The next day C.C. had been taken to a doctor, who had established that he had “a minor head injury of level 0-1”, which required nine days of medical treatment.', '36.  The applicant also alleged that on 14 November 2005, during the morning call, he had been hit and insulted by a supervising officer, N.I., and two members of the intervention unit.', '37.  After the incidents on 10, 11 and 14 November 2005, the applicant lodged with the Prosecution Office attached to the Giurgiu District Court a criminal complaint against the following prison officers:\\na) C.C. and other members of the intervention unit, for hitting him on the evening of 10 November 2005 upon his return from a court hearing;\\nb) S.C., S.V., C.C. and other members of the intervention unit for allegedly beating, threatening and insulting him on 11 November 2005;\\nc) prison warden I.N. for allegedly insulting and hitting him during the morning call on 14 November 2005.', '38.  On 24 November 2005 the applicant was brought before the Giurgiu District Court concerning his request that the prison administration’s decision to grade him as a “dangerous detainee” be revoked (see paragraph 18 above). During the hearing, he complained that he had been repeatedly beaten in Giurgiu Prison by State agents and that his body still bore bruises, and that he suffered pain in the right rib cage. He also indicated that he had filed complaints with the prosecutor and the prison administration, asking to see a doctor, but that he had received no answer.\\nThe court took note of the criminal complaints lodged by the applicant and forwarded them to the prosecutor for further investigation. It also ordered the Giurgiu Prison administration to allow a doctor to see the applicant in order to have a medical certificate drawn up in relation to his allegations of ill-treatment.', '39.  Following the Giurgiu District Court’s order, the applicant was examined by a doctor the next day, on 25 November 2005. A forensic medical report was drawn up, indicating multiple bruises in the area of the applicant’s thighs and lower legs, which were deemed to still require some two to three days’ medical treatment. The report also stated that the bruises could have been caused on 10 or 11 November 2005 by impact with hard objects.', '40.  On 12 December 2005 the Prosecution Office indicted the applicant for assault on a State agent, for having hit C.C. on 10 November 2005 (see paragraphs 46 et seq. below).', '41.  On 31 October 2006 the Prosecution Office decided not to open criminal proceedings against I.N. in relation to the alleged incident on 14 November 2005, on the ground that the complaint had not been substantiated. The prosecution established that the only witness who had supported the applicant’s version of events, S.M., had not been an eye‑witness; he had only heard screams and shouting involving the applicant and I.N from his cell. The other witnesses, who had been sharing the cell with the applicant, had not seen anything.', '42.  The decision not to open criminal proceedings against I.N. was upheld by the higher prosecutor on 22 January 2007.', '43.  On 20 March 2008 Giurgiu County Court upheld the decision not to open proceedings. The court reached this decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution, without any evidence being administered or any witnesses being heard.', '44.  On 12 December 2006 the Prosecution Office decided not to open criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged incidents of 10 and 11 November. The prosecutor established that on 10 November 2005, due to the fact that the applicant had been denied a particular request, he had succeeded in freeing one hand from his handcuffs and hitting one of the agents of the special intervention unit, C.C., in the face. The intervention squad had managed to immobilize the applicant. The prosecutor considered that the forensic certificate drawn up on 25 November 2005 could not constitute evidence showing that the injuries had been inflicted by I.N. and C.C., since there was a possibility that those injuries had been inflicted during the immobilization of the applicant. The prosecutor further indicated that the statements made by those witnesses who were also detainees were subjective, due to the fact that they had been the applicant’s fellow inmates; moreover, they had presented the facts differently.', '45.  The decision not to open criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged incidents of 10 and 11 November 2005 was upheld by the higher prosecutor on 7 February 2007.', '46.  On 11 February 2008 the Giurgiu District Court upheld the decision of 7 February 2007. The court reached its decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution, without administering evidence or hearing witnesses.\\nThe court found that the witnesses did not confirm the applicant’s allegations. In particular, those witnesses in Giurgiu Prison who had seen the applicant being hit by agents wearing balaclavas were unable to provide the names of those agents, while other witnesses had no knowledge at all of the said events. The court found the statement by an inmate, S.M., to the effect that one of the two agents wearing balaclavas who had beaten the applicant had been C.C., unconvincing on the ground that the agents’ faces had been covered by the balaclavas. The court further found, with respect to the forensic medical certificate, that “the mere existence of those bruises does not indicate the respondents’ guilt.”', '47.  On 15 May 2008 Giurgiu County Court upheld the decision of 11 February 2008, finding that the applicant’s allegations had not been fully substantiated. The court reached its decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution. It concluded that despite a number of witnesses confirming the occurrence of incidents between the applicant and the prison wardens in Giurgiu Prison, none of those witnesses had identified the applicant’s aggressors as the defendants indicated by the applicant.', '48.  On 12 December 2005 the Prosecution Office indicted the applicant for assault on a State agent, for having hit C.C. on 10 November 2005. After questioning witnesses to the incident on 10 November 2005 and in the light of the medical certificate issued on 11 November 2005, indicating that C.C. had needed eight to nine days of medical care, the prosecutor established that the applicant had voluntarily hit C.C. on 10 November 2005.', '49.  Before the Giurgiu District Court the applicant claimed that he had not hit C.C. on 10 November 2005. He contended that while he had been vehemently protesting against the guards’ refusal to take him to the store room, two members of the intervention squad had approached him and hit him. During his attempts to defend himself from the blows, one of the agents might have accidentally been hurt. He claimed, however, that he had not behaved aggressively and had not resisted the immobilisation manoeuvres. He relied on the statements of all the witnesses to the incident, which had shown that he had not acted violently when the agents had attempted to immobilize him. He further stressed that numerous witnesses had stated that the State agents had assaulted him, and pointed to the incoherency of the statements of the agents who claimed that he had voluntarily hit C.C.\\nHe finally asked the court to hear evidence from all witnesses to the incident, inmates and State agents.', '50.  On 22 May 2006 the Giurgiu District Court convicted the applicant of assault on a State agent, C.C., sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment and, as required by Article 71 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with Article 64 a) of the Criminal Code, deprived him of his right to vote as an additional penalty.\\nThe court firstly noted that the inmates who had witnessed the incident of 10 November 2005 had withdrawn the statements they had made to the prosecutor in which they had indicated that the applicant had hit C.C. Before the court, they had stated that those statements had been made under duress. They submitted to the court that it was the applicant who had been assaulted by the State agents.\\nThe court found those statements irrelevant, on the ground that they merely proved an alleged provocation by the State agents, and did not exculpate the applicant from the injuries he had caused to C.C. The court further found that those injuries had been caused with intent, as the statements given by the State agents questioned in the court showed.', '51.  Following an amendment of the Criminal Code on certain sentences, an appeal by the applicant was allowed on 18 June 2007 by the Giurgiu County Court, with regard to the prison sentence only, which was reduced to one year. The decision was upheld by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 7 January 2008.', '52.  On 29 April 2004 the Giurgiu prison administration informed the applicant that his common-law wife, P.N.M., was not allowed to visit him, since the prison records indicated that he was married to another woman. Her name was therefore not put on the list of people allowed to visit the applicant.', '53.  On 18 March 2005, relying on Government Ordinance no. 56/2003, the applicant challenged the refusal of the Giurgiu Prison administration to allow him visits from P.N.M. with the Giurgiu District Court. By a decision of 31 March 2005 the court found for the applicant and ordered the decision in question to be quashed and the applicant to be entitled to visits from P.N.M.

The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Moscow.', '5.  According to the applicant, on 27 April 2000 he brought proceedings before the Timiryazevskiy District Court of Moscow seeking compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage against a municipal maintenance enterprise. According to him, the enterprise should have repaired the bathroom or plumbing equipment on upper floors of the building in which he was living. As can be seen from a copy of his statement of claim, submitted to the Court, this statement had a handwritten inscription “lodged on 27 April 2000 [unreadable signature]”. According to the Government the claim was lodged and assigned to a judge on 3 May 2001.', '6.  On 16 August 2001 the District Court discontinued the proceedings considering that there had already been a final judgment in the same matter issued on 2 July 2001. On 6 September 2001 the Moscow City Court quashed the above decision and remitted the case to the District Court. The City Court considered that it had not been properly established by the first-instance court that the above cases concerned the same subject-matter.', '7.  On 21 September 2001 the case was assigned to a professional judge sitting with lay judges. Eight hearings were scheduled and adjourned between October 2001 and February 2002 on account of the lay judges’ failure to attend hearings. On 12 and 27 February 2002 the court requested a local hospital to provide information on the applicant’s state of health. Further six hearings were adjourned to collect evidence and summon witnesses. Two hearings were adjourned because the applicant defaulted.', '8.  By a judgment of 1 August 2002, the District Court granted the applicant’s claim in part and awarded him 2,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The applicant appealed. On 22 January 2003 the City Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case for re-examination. The City Court considered that the District Court had misinterpreted the subject-matter of the applicant’s claims.', '9.  On 29 April 2003 the applicant requested the District Court to examine the case in his absence. The court granted this request. On 18 July 2003 the District Court discontinued the case referring to the applicant’s failure to attend hearings. On 26 August 2003 the City Court quashed the decision and required the District Court to examine the case. According to the Government, on an unspecified date the District Court issued a notice that the applicant’s presence at the hearings had been indispensable.', '10.  By a decision of 29 December 2003 the District Court again discontinued the case on grounds of the applicant’s failure to attend an unspecified number of hearings. The text of the decision indicated that “the plaintiff could challenge this decision by applying to a court within ten days”. Considering that this decision was amenable to appeal to a higher court, on 16 January 2004 the applicant appealed to the City Court alleging that the discontinuation had been unlawful. According to the Government, on an unspecified date, the City or District Court returned the appeal to the applicant and informed him of his right to challenge the decision not to examine the case before the same District Court.', '11.  In March 2004 the applicant complained to the President of the City Court that his appeal had not been examined. This complaint was forwarded to the District Court. No reply was received.', '12.  On 2 October 2006 the applicant sought an extension of the time-limit for his appeal. He also explained that he had waived his right to be present at hearings listed in late 2003 and thus had not attended any of those hearings. On 12 October 2006 the District Court granted his request and quashed the decision of 29 December 2003. The court noted that the above decision did not contain sufficient detail as to the procedure for appeal. It also observed that the applicant had waived his right to be present at hearings in 2003 and that no decision had been taken in order to recognise his personal presence at those hearings indispensable for the proper conduct of the proceedings.', '13.  By judgment of 18 October 2006, the District Court awarded the applicant RUB 3,000.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Mysłowice.', '5.  On 4 October 2002 the applicant was arrested in Blanes, Spain, under an international search and arrest warrant on suspicion of having committed several offences of fraud, forgery, perjury, uttering threats, robbery and kidnapping, while acting in an organised criminal group. On 12 February 2002 the Central Investigating Court in Madrid no. 3 (Juzgado Central de Instrucción) granted a request for the applicant’s extradition. On 28 April 2003 the applicant was brought to Poland.', '6.  On 30 April 2003 the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody until 30 June 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court stressed that this had happened before and had given rise to the issue of the international search and arrest warrant and to the extradition proceedings.', '7.  On 23 September 2003 the Katowice District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 October 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question, the severity of the anticipated sentence, the fear that he might tamper with evidence and the complexity of the case. The applicant appealed.', '8.  On 29 October 2003 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.', '9.  The applicant maintains that when he was detained between 28 April 2003 and 1 April 2004 he was forced to testify, subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and that the conditions of his detention were poor. Moreover, he maintains that he was deprived of contact with his family.', '10.  On 20 December 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Katowice District Court. The bill of indictment listed several charges of fraud, forgery, perjury, robbery and kidnapping brought against thirteen accused, committed in the context of an organised criminal group.', '11.  On 28 December 2004 the Katowice District Court further extended the applicant’s detention until 30 June 2005. The court considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid. The applicant appealed.', '12.  On 9 March 2005 the Katowice Regional Court partly amended the decision of the district court and reduced the further period of his detention, fixing the deadline for 27 April 2005.', '13.  On 20 April 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 27 August 2005.', '14.  At the first hearing, held on 23 May 2005, the Katowice District Court found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the case and referred it to the Katowice Regional Court.', '15.  On 2 June 2005 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice (Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwosci) about delays in the proceedings and his extradition from Spain. His complaint was referred to the Katowice District Court. In a letter of 30 June 2005 the President of the Katowice District Court informed the applicant that the trial court had dealt promptly with the case, which was very complex.', '16.  On 27 June 2005 the applicant made an application for release. He requested that his detention be replaced by another preventive measure.', '17.  On 8 July 2005 the Katowice District Court dismissed the application. The court found that the evidence obtained in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against him. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. The court stressed that the fact that the applicant had acted in an organised criminal group posed in itself a risk of his obstructing the proper course of the proceedings.', '18.  On 24 August 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 March 2006. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.', '19.  On 12 December 2005 the Katowice Regional Court found that the District Court was competent to deal with the applicant’s case and referred it back to the Katowice District Court.', '20.  On 16 January 2006 the Katowice District Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release or as an alternative the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. On 27 February 2006 the Katowice Regional Court upheld that decision. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.', '21.  The hearings scheduled for 21 April, 5 May and 19 May 2006 were adjourned.', '22.  On 29 March 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 August 2006. On 23 August 2006 that court ordered his continued detention until 30 December 2006. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 27 September 2006 by the Katowice Court of Appeal.', '23.  On 2 June 2006 the court held the first hearing on the merits.', '24.  On 1 December 2006 the Katowice District Court released the applicant under police supervision. It also ordered that the applicant be forbidden to leave his place of residence. The proceedings are still pending.', '25.

On 22 February 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed his complaint. The court examined only the proceedings before the Regional Court, namely from 17 August 2005 to 12 December 2005, and held that there were no delays for which the Regional Court could be held responsible. It noted that the court, when deciding on administrative and procedural matters, acted without delay. It further considered irrelevant the fact that at the material time the trial had not yet commenced.', '27.  As regards the proceedings before the Katowice District Court, which began on 20 December 2004 and which are still pending before it, the Court of Appeal referred this part of the complaint to the Katowice Regional Court for consideration.

In 1993 the applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to twenty four years’ imprisonment.', '8.  On 8 March 2002 the applicant was conditionally released from prison.', '9.  On 23 March 2002 at 8.40 p.m. the applicant was arrested at his home on suspicion of leading a criminal organisation and involvement in the attempted abduction of a certain Ş.H. and his son, H.H. He was subsequently placed in custody by the organised crime division of the Istanbul Security Directorate.', '10.  On 24 March 2002 at 8 p.m. the applicant and six other persons were examined at the Haseki Hospital, in Istanbul, by a doctor who recorded on a single sheet of paper that there was no sign of violence on the bodies of these seven persons.', '11.  On the same day at 10.30 p.m. the applicant was once again examined at the Haseki Hospital by a doctor who noted that he had been told that the applicant had hit his head against a wall. The doctor, a general practitioner, observed the following injuries on the applicant’s body: a swelling on the left side of the forehead and a headache, a hyperaemia of 0.5 cm in width around both wrists and a hyperaemia of 2 cm on the right side of the neck. The doctor considered that the applicant should also be examined by a neurosurgeon, who subsequently carried out a number of tests on the applicant and concluded that the applicant did not show any signs of pathology.', '12.  On 25 March 2002 at 9.10 p.m. the applicant underwent a further medical examination at the Haseki Hospital by a doctor who noted in a medical report the same injuries as those mentioned in the medical report of 24 March 2002.', '13.  On 26 March 2002 at 7 p.m. the applicant was once again taken to the Haseki Hospital for an examination. The medical expert noted that there was an erythema of 3 cm in diameter on the right side of the applicant’s forehead, scabbed wounds of 3 cm on the underside of his wrists and a hyperaemia of 2 cm on the right side of his neck.', '14.  On 27 March 2002 the applicant underwent two medical examinations. The first examination took place at the Haseki Hospital at 9.30 a.m. The doctor observed scabbed wounds on the underside of the wrists, a recovering hyperaemia of 2 cm on the right side of the neck and an erythema of 2 cm in diameter on the right side of the forehead. The second medical examination was carried out by a medical expert at the Forensic Medicine Institute branch responsible for the Istanbul State Security Court at 11 a.m. The doctor who examined the applicant observed the following injuries on his body: a scabbed abrasion of 3 cm on the underside of the left wrist, a scabbed abrasion of 1 cm on the underside of the right wrist, a scabbed abrasion of 0.5 cm on the back of the right wrist, two thin abrasions of 1 cm and 3 cm on the right side of the forehead. The doctor concluded that these injuries did not put the applicant’s life at risk but rendered him unfit to carry out daily activities for three days.', '15.  According to the applicant, he was subjected to ill-treatment throughout his detention in police custody. In particular, he was kept blindfolded and handcuffed to an iron bar for five days. He was beaten, given electric shocks and made to lie on a bed over which his arms and legs were stretched, and his genitals were squeezed.', '16.  According to the Government, the applicant sustained his injuries as a result of his own conduct. The scratches and traces on his body were a result of having attempted to break his handcuffs, and he had hit his head on the floor. In support of their submissions, the Government provided video footage from the surveillance camera monitoring the room in which the applicant was detained, recorded between 9.11 p.m. and 9.16 p.m. on 24 March 2002 (see paragraph 21 below).', '17.  On 24 March 2002 at 9.20 p.m. eight police officers and the applicant signed an incident report according to which the applicant was kept attached to a bed in order to prevent him from harming himself. The report states that at around 9.10 p.m., he managed to break one of his handcuffs and hit his head on the floor. The officers recorded that they had used force to handcuff the applicant and that the applicant had sustained injuries on his wrists as a result. According to the report, the injuries on the applicant’s head had occurred when he hit his head on the floor.', '18.  On 26 and 27 March 2002 statements were taken from the applicant by two police officers. According to the document drafted at 00.35 a.m. on 27 March 2002 and signed by the applicant, the police told the applicant that he had been in possession of a mobile phone whilst in prison and that the conversations that he had held using this telephone had been intercepted by the police. The police officers alleged that he had given instructions for the abduction of a number of persons by phone and that it was considered that he had been the leader of a criminal organisation. The applicant denied the allegations that he had made the phone calls in question and that he had been involved in criminal activities. In his statements to the police, the applicant accepted that he knew some of the persons who had been arrested on the same day as him and that he knew that two other arrestees had attempted to abduct Ş.H. He stated that he knew Ş.H. personally, but that he had not been involved in his abduction attempt.', '19.  On 27 March 2002 the applicant appeared before the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court. He denied the allegations against him and submitted that he had been subjected to torture in police custody. He alleged that he had been beaten, given electric shocks and stretched by his arms and legs, had his testicles squeezed, and been handcuffed to an iron bar for five days. On the same day he was remanded in detention by a judge.', '20.  Between 23 and 27 March 2002 the six persons who had been taken into police custody on the same day as the applicant also made statements to the police. According to some of these statements, the applicant had been the leader of a criminal organisation and had given instructions for the abduction of Ş.H. These persons were also medically examined during and after their detention in police custody. Some of them were found to have sustained injuries to various parts of their bodies.', '21.  During the proceedings before the Court, the Government produced a CD-ROM containing a police video recording. The CD-ROM contains images of a room. The part which concerns the applicant was recorded between 9.11 p.m. and 9.16 p.m. on 24 March 2002. It shows that the applicant was kept in a room on a mattress, the top of which is placed on two chairs. The applicant is seen lying down on the mattress with his arms straight out to the sides and attached to the chair legs. He is also blindfolded with a piece of black cloth. On the other side of the room, there are four or five plainclothes police officers standing around a desk and a chair. The applicant begins moving with a view to standing up. Four officers approach the applicant, detach him from the chairs, put him on the floor, kneel around him and for about one and a half minutes keep the applicant under physical restraint on the floor. During this period, the applicant cannot be seen by the camera. Thereafter, another plainclothes officer arrives in the room and instructs the other officers to arrange the mattress and the chairs in a certain way. Subsequently, the applicant is seen without the blindfold and with his arms held behind his back by two officers who are also holding him around his neck. They make the applicant stand in front of the newly-arrived officer, who douses the applicant’s face with water from a plastic bottle. He then hits the applicant on the head with the same bottle. Afterwards, six officers place the top of the mattress on the chairs, force the applicant to lie down on the mattress on his back, handcuff him to the chair legs and blindfold him.', '22.  On 3 April 2002 the applicant lodged a petition with the Fatih public prosecutor’s office and alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during his detention in police custody.', '23.  On 22 May 2002 the applicant made statements to the Fatih public prosecutor in which he complained about his alleged ill-treatment while in police custody. He claimed that he had been insulted, threatened, beaten, stripped naked, stretched by his arms and legs, blindfolded, given electric shocks and had his genitals squeezed. The applicant submitted that there were a superintendent, A.İ., and the director of the Department of Organised Crime of the Istanbul Security Directorate, A.S.S., among those who had tortured him. The applicant also provided the names of several persons who had allegedly witnessed his ill-treatment in police custody and asked the public prosecutor to take their statements as witnesses.', '24.  On 29 July and 6 and 22 August 2002 the Fatih public prosecutor took statements from İ.E., N.K., S.G. and M.G., the police officers who had been on duty at the time of the applicant’s detention in police custody. They all denied the veracity of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment.', '25.  On 17 October 2002 the Fatih public prosecutor further obtained statements from A.İ., who submitted that the applicant had hit his head on the floor. On 20 January 2003 A.S.S. also made statements to the Fatih public prosecutor and maintained that he had not been involved in the applicant’s questioning.', '26.  On 21 January 2003 the Fatih public prosecutor requested the Department of Organised Crime of the Istanbul Security Directorate to submit any video recording demonstrating that the applicant had resisted the officers, if such recording existed.', '27.  On 25 February 2003 A.S.S., in his capacity as the director of the Department of Organised Crime, sent the video recording of 24 March 2002 (see paragraph 21 above) along with a letter to the Fatih public prosecutor’s office. In his letter, A.S.S. noted that the applicant had resisted the police officers while in police custody.', '28.  On 20 June 2003 the Fatih public prosecutor sent the video recording to the Forensic Medicine Institute and requested that a report clarifying whether the applicant could have sustained the injuries noted in the medical reports as a result of his own conduct be drafted. The public prosecutor also submitted the medical reports concerning the applicant to the Institute.', '29.  On 13 August 2003 six medical experts from the Forensic Medicine Institute, including the president, drafted a report after examining the medical reports issued during the applicant’s police custody and the photographs and video footage submitted to them by the Fatih public prosecutor. In their report, the doctors concluded that the applicant’s injuries had occurred as a result of his own conduct. They considered that, following the applicant’s agitation, the police officers had struggled to lay him down on a camp bed and had handcuffed his hands to the bed. They further stated that the applicant did not appear to have been subjected to any beatings in the video footage. Having considered the position of the applicant’s injuries on his body, they concluded that the injuries must have been caused by the applicant’s own conduct.', '30.  On 15 October 2003 the Fatih public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Fatih Criminal Court accusing six police officers, A.İ, A.S.S., İ.E, N.K., S.G. and M.G., of inflicting ill-treatment on the applicant and one of his co-accused, Ö.Ç.', '31.  On 8 December 2003 the applicant testified before the Bolu Criminal Court, acting on letters rogatory. The applicant contended that he had been kept blindfolded throughout his detention, stretched by his arms and legs, given electric shocks, hosed with cold water, stripped naked and had his genitals squeezed.', '32.  On 12 February 2004 the Fatih Criminal Court held the first hearing on the merits of the case and heard evidence from the accused police officers, except one officer, A.S.S., who did not participate in the hearing. They all maintained that they had not ill-treated the applicant or Ö.Ç. As regards the applicant, they contended that they had handcuffed him upon the instructions of a public prosecutor and subsequently used force with a view to preventing him from harming himself. One of the officers, İ.E., maintained that the applicant had sustained injuries to his head as he had hit his head against the wall. They referred to the video footage recorded on 24 March 2002. During the same hearing, C.A., one of the applicant’s lawyers who represented him along with A.K. Özcan, requested that the applicant be allowed to join the proceedings as an intervening party. His request was granted. The applicant’s representative further requested the court to obtain the entire video recording of the places where the applicant had been held throughout his detention in police custody. The court decided to consider this request subsequently, after obtaining the statements of all accused police officers.', '33.  Between 12 February 2004 and 5 October 2004 the trial court adjourned the hearings as A.S.S. could not be located.', '34.  On 5 October 2004 A.S.S. made statements before the Fatih Criminal Court and denied the veracity of the applicant’s allegations. He reiterated that he had not been involved in the questioning of the applicant and Ö.Ç. On the same day the Fatih Criminal Court ordered the Security Directorate to send it the video recordings concerning the applicant’s police custody.', '35.  On 2 February 2005 the first-instance court adjourned the hearing as the video footage requested during the previous hearing had not been received. One of the applicant’s lawyers, C.A., was present during this hearing.', '36.  Upon receipt of the video footage of 24 March 2002, during the hearing of 3 March 2005 the Fatih Criminal Court viewed the recording and observed that one person had suddenly bent forwards and the police officers had immediately intervened. The court noted that the video footage was very short, lasting a few seconds, and the people in the images were not identifiable. At the same hearing, one of the accused police officers, İ.E., contended that the person in the footage was the applicant himself, who had hit his head on the floor in order to be able to lodge a complaint against them for ill-treatment in police custody, and that they had intervened to stop him.', '37.  On 14 June 2005 the Fatih Criminal Court referred the case to the Istanbul Assize Court on account of lack of jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 94 of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), which defined ill-treatment by public servants as torture, an offence that should be tried by assize courts.', '38.  On 3 October 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court issued a summons requiring the applicant and the accused police officers to attend the hearing to be held on 29 November 2005. The summons issued in respect of the applicant was served on A.K. Özcan. On 29 November and 27 December 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court held two hearings and heard evidence from the accused police officers, who reiterated the statements they had made before the Fatih Criminal Court. Neither the applicant nor his representatives participated in these hearings.', '39.  During the hearing held on 27 December 2005 the public prosecutor requested that the police officers be acquitted of the charges against them. At the end of the same hearing the Istanbul Assize Court acquitted the accused police officers of the charges of torture. On the basis of the evidence before it, namely the medical reports, the report of the Forensic Medicine Institute dated 13 August 2003, the statements taken from the accused officers, the applicant and Ö.Ç., and the aforementioned video footage, the Istanbul Assize Court found that the applicant had been agitated and the police officers had handcuffed him to a camp bed with a view to preventing him from injuring himself. The court noted that the injuries observed on the applicant’s wrists and other parts of his body had thus occurred as a result of his agitation. The assize court considered that the applicant had not been subjected to beatings. It concluded that the accused officers had not tortured the applicant.', '40.  On 20 January 2006 the judgment of 27 December 2005 was served on lawyer C.A. As C.A. could not be found in his office, the notification document was left with the mayor of the neighbourhood, in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Notifications.', '41.  On 21 January 2011 A.K. Özcan, acting on behalf of the applicant, submitted a petition to the Istanbul Assize Court. He maintained that the judgment of 27 December 2005 had been served on a lawyer who had not been involved in the case and asked to be officially served with the judgment in question.', '42.  On 14 February 2011 another lawyer lodged an appeal with the Istanbul Assize Court, to be submitted to the Court of Cassation, against the judgment of 27 December 2005 on behalf of the applicant, claiming that the judgment of 27 December 2005 had erroneously been served on C.A.', '43.  On 28 February 2011 the Istanbul Assize Court rejected the petition, holding that C.A. had represented the applicant during the proceedings and his power of attorney was in the case file. It further noted that the judgment had already been served on him and that notification to one of the applicant’s representatives had been sufficient for the judgment to become final. The assize court therefore considered that the appeal dated 14 February 2011 had been submitted outside the time-limit laid down for submission of appeals in Article 310 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '44.  The applicant appealed against the decision of the Istanbul Assize Court.', '45.  On 22 May 2013 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of 28 February 2011.', '46.  According to the documents in the case file, on 18 March 2003 A.S.S. and on an unspecified date A.İ. were dismissed from duty respectively on account of some other criminal convictions. According to the judgment of 27 December 2005 one of the police officers, İ.E., was promoted and became a superintendent during the criminal proceedings brought against him.', '47.  On 30 April 2002 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and fifteen other individuals. The applicant was charged with leading a criminal organisation and the attempted abduction of Ş.H. and H.H. in order to obtain a ransom. The charges were brought under Article 1 of Law no. 4422 on the Struggle against Profit-oriented Criminal Organisations and Article 499 of the former Criminal Code. The public prosecutor claimed that the applicant had been in possession of a mobile phone while he was in prison, that his conversations had been intercepted by the police following a court decision and that he had given instructions by phone to two of his co-accused for the abduction attempt. In this connection, the public prosecutor referred to the transcripts of the telephone conversations which were included in the investigation file. The public prosecutor further claimed that the applicant had expanded the criminal organisation subsequent to his release from prison and his co‑accused had either become members of this organisation or had aided it. In the indictment, the public prosecutor had explained the details of the abduction attempt regarding Ş.H. and H.H., specifying the role of each accused. The applicant was identified as the person who had given the order for this offence to be committed.', '48.  On 23 July 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court held the first hearing on the merits of the case. During this hearing, the applicant made statements before the court and maintained that he had been tortured while in police custody. He maintained that he had been made to listen to a recording of a telephone conversation by the police and that as he had denied that he had held the conversation in question, he had been tortured. He described the treatment he had allegedly been subjected to in detail and denied the veracity of his police statements. He further submitted that he had not made any phone calls or given instructions when he had been in prison and that these allegations had been invented by the police. He contended that he knew neither his co-accused nor Ş.H. or H.H. During the hearing of 23 July 2002 the applicant’s co-accused also denied the veracity of their police statements, claiming that they had been forced to sign those statements by the police and that they had been ill-treated whilst in police custody. During the hearing, the medical report of 27 March 2002 issued by the Forensic Medicine Institute in respect of the applicant was read out. At the end of the hearing, noting that the applicant had lodged a formal complaint with the Fatih public prosecutor’s office requesting that his allegations of ill‑treatment be investigated, the Istanbul State Security Court decided to request information from the Fatih public prosecutor as to the outcome of the investigation.', '49.  During the second hearing in the case, held on 24 September 2002, the applicant once again denied that he had made telephone calls while in prison. One of his lawyers contended that the police reports according to which the applicant had made telephone calls did not reflect the truth and requested his client’s release. At the end of the hearing, as the Fatih public prosecutor’s office had not sent the information requested on 23 July 2002, the first-instance court reiterated its request for information regarding the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment.', '50.  During the third hearing on 12 December 2002 one of the applicant’s lawyers maintained that it would have been impossible for the applicant to possess a mobile phone whilst detained in an F-type prison. At the end of the hearing, the Istanbul State Security Court once again decided to request information from the Fatih public prosecutor’s office.', '51.  On 11 March 2003 the fourth hearing in the case was held. During the hearing one of the applicant’s lawyers stated that the information requested from the Fatih public prosecutor’s office had been submitted and the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment was pending. However, the first-instance court neither noted that this document had been submitted nor read it out.', '52.  During the same hearing, H.H., the son of the person whose abduction had allegedly been ordered by the applicant, made a statement before the trial court and submitted that neither of the accused had been involved in the attempted abduction. During the same hearing, the applicant’s lawyers contended that the only evidence against the applicant was the police statements of his co-accused, which had been obtained through ill‑treatment and the veracity of which had been denied by each of the accused.', '53.  On 29 May 2003 the fifth hearing was held, during which the public prosecutor submitted his opinion on the merits of the case and the accused were asked to provide their observations on the public prosecutor’s opinion by the next hearing. During the hearing, the applicant submitted a petition to the first-instance court in which he submitted that he did not have a good relationship with his brother and claimed that he had been the victim of a conspiracy organised by a senior police director who was a friend of his brother. Finally, one of the applicant’s lawyers maintained that the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment was still pending.', '54.  During the sixth and last hearing in the case, held on 18 July 2003, one of the applicant’s lawyers maintained that there was no evidence against the applicant in the case file other than the statements obtained under torture and that an investigation had been launched into the applicant’s allegations of torture by the Fatih public prosecutor. Another lawyer representing the applicant also made defence statements. He contended that the telephone tapping in question had been illegal and that there had not been a court order authorising it. He further noted that the police statements obtained from the applicant under torture could not be used as evidence.', '55.  On the same day the Istanbul State Security Court rendered its judgment in the case. The applicant was convicted of leading an armed criminal organisation and of the abduction of Ş.H. and H.H. in order to obtain a ransom as charged and was sentenced to nine years, five months and ten days’ imprisonment. His conditional release in respect of his previous sentence was also revoked.', '56.  In its judgment, the first-instance court found it established, in the light of the content of the case file as a whole, to which the court repeatedly referred in its reasoning, and the evidence in its possession (which included, inter alia, the following evidence: transcripts of telephone conversations allegedly held by the applicant, material evidence collected where the attempted abduction of Ş.H. and H.H. had occurred, witness statements, the applicant’s and the co-accuseds’ police statements, and statements made to the public prosecutor and a judge at the State Security Court on 27 March 2002), that the applicant had planned the attempted abduction of Ş.H. and had given instructions to two of his co-accused to carry out the abduction in telephone calls he had made using a mobile phone when he was in prison. This telephone had originally been used by other inmates in prison and had been tapped by the police. The police had found out that the applicant had also used it in order to give instructions to the members of his criminal organisation and had subsequently conducted an investigation into the applicant and his co‑accused. The first-instance court further noted that, after having assessed all the evidence in the case file, taking into account the legislation and the Court of Cassation’s case-law, it had come to the conclusion that the applicant and his co-accused had already formed a criminal organisation prior to the attempted abduction. The State Security Court therefore found, once again referring to the content of the case file, which included the applicant’s police statements, that the applicant was the leader of the criminal organisation in question and six other co-accused were members of that organisation.', '57.  On 26 May 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.', '58.  Following the entry into force of the new Criminal Code in 2005, the Istanbul Assize Court reviewed the applicant’s conviction of 18 July 2003 and his sentence in the light of the provisions of the new Code. On 6 April 2006 the assize court amended the applicant’s sentence and imposed on him four years and three months’ imprisonment, holding that the new Code provided more favourable conditions for the applicant. One of the applicant’s lawyers, A.K. Özcan, was present when the assize court pronounced its judgment.', '59.  On 20 February 2007 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of 6 April 2006.'], 'applicants': ['AYDIN ÇETİNKAYA'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['21', '39', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70'], '6': ['108', '11', '12', '13', '14', '18', '39', '48', '51', '56', '58', '59']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 33, 42, 45, 50, 52, 53], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 33, 42, 45, 50, 52, 53], 'explained_indices': [3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 1, 0, 39, 38, 37, 36, 32, 34, 33, 40, 35, 41, 45, 43, 44, 31, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 42, 30, 26, 28, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 29, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 52, 27, 18, 53], 'explained_distances': [0.11560798, 0.10786431, 0.10045998, 0.09525728, 0.08099562, 0.079156086, 0.064443946, 0.037549518, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126, 0.03468126], 'number_of_sentences': 54, 'article_id': 2, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

On an unspecified date in 1995, the applicant instituted civil proceedings for debt against Mr N. and a company run and owned by the latter (“the company”). He claimed that he had bought a vehicle (“the vehicle”) for 54,000 German marks (“DM”) for the benefit of the company and that, in return, he had received from Mr N. another vehicle and DM 10,000. The remaining balance was DM 24,000.', '5. On 26 September 1995 the then Bitola Municipal Court (Општински суд Битола) (“the first-instance court”) issued an injunction preventing Mr N. from selling the vehicle.', '6. On 27 November 1995 the first-instance court ruled partly in favour of the applicant and ordered Mr N. and the company (“the debtors”) jointly to pay him DM 24,000 together with interest (домицилна камата). In addition, it ordered the debtors to pay the applicant’s costs. On 28 February 1996 the then Bitola District Court (Окружен суд Битола) confirmed that decision. It also declared it final in respect of Mr N. as he had not challenged it.', '7. On 25 September 1997 the Supreme Court upheld an appeal by the applicant on points of law (ревизија) and quashed the lower courts’ decisions in respect of the company only. It held that they had not decided the applicant’s claim as submitted, in that they had ignored his request to have his claim converted into the national currency.', '8. On 29 April 2004 the first-instance court upheld the applicant’s claim and ordered the debtors (Mr N. and the company) jointly to pay the applicant 636,384.00 Macedonian denars (equivalent to DM 24,000) together with default interest (затезна камата) calculated as of 11 August 1995. On 13 September 2004 that court ordered the debtors to reimburse the trial costs incurred by the applicant. On 4 November 2004 those decisions became final.\\n(b) Enforcement proceedings', '9. On 1 April 1996 the first-instance court granted the applicant’s request for enforcement of the decision of 27 November 1995. The debt was to be honoured by an inventory and public sale of Mr N.’s property or by its transfer from the company’s bank account. On 13 May 1996 that court refused the company’s objection and declared the order against Mr N. final as he had not challenged it. That decision was confirmed by the then Bitola District Court’s decision of 10 June 1996.', '10. On 17 June 1996 the first-instance court ordered the then Payment Exchange Office (Завод за платен промет) to enforce its order by transferring the amount due from the company’s account to the applicant’s. On 2 July 1996 the first-instance court ordered enforcement of the applicant’s claim by means of an inventory and public sale of the debtors’ movable property, including the vehicle. That decision was set aside by the Bitola Court of Appeal on 24 October 1996.', '11. After establishing that there were insufficient funds in the company’s account, on 26 December 1996 the first-instance court ordered continuation of the enforcement proceedings. A public sale of the vehicle was fixed for 24 March 1997. On 25 March 1997 a third party challenged that decision since it had obtained possession of the vehicle on the basis of a sales contract concluded with the company.', '12. On 14 April 1997 the first-instance court granted the applicant an enforcement title over the vehicle and ordered the third party to transfer the vehicle into the applicant’s possession. On 3 June 1997 the Bitola Court of Appeal dismissed appeals by the debtors and the third party and confirmed the above decision.', '13. On 18 December 1997 the first-instance court authorised the third party to register the disputed vehicle in his possession, but ordered him not to sell it before the final conclusion of the enforcement proceedings. It established that Mr N. had meanwhile deposited about DM 13,000 in various currencies to secure the applicant’s claim.', '14. On 23 January 1998 Mr N. left the respondent State.', '15. On 27 January 1998 the first-instance court ordered its treasurer to transfer to the applicant the funds deposited by Mr N.', '16. On 11 March 1998 the first-instance court requested the police to confiscate the disputed vehicle from the third party. The police replied that the third party had obtained ownership of the vehicle on the basis of a sales contract certified by the Štip Court of First Instance and that accordingly, the latter court should proceed with the enforcement.', '17. On 27 April 1998 the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the enforcement of his claim had been delayed as the whereabouts of Mr N. were unknown. On 9 September 1998 that court stated that the delay had been caused by the police’s failure to enforce the order. On 12 November 1998 the Ombudsman informed the applicant that the case had been transferred to the Štip Court of First Instance, as competent ratione loci, to proceed with the enforcement.', '18. On 17 June 1998 Mr N. was convicted of fraud and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for selling the vehicle to the third party despite the court’s order (see paragraph 5 above) not to do so.', '19.  On 2 June 1999 the first-instance court informed the applicant that as of 16 February 1999 the enforcement proceedings had been transferred to the Štip Court of First Instance.

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Costeşti.', '6.  On 15 July 2008 the applicant was visited by three police officers who inquired about the whereabouts of his son and who wanted to conduct a search of the applicant’s house. According to the applicant, when he asked whether they had a warrant they beat him up, handcuffed him and took him to the police station. At the police station the ill-treatment continued. The applicant received a blow to his head as a result of which he fell over and lost consciousness. He woke up lying in a pool of blood and was made to clean it up. The applicant was detained and released five days later. The Government did not contest the above facts.', '7.  On 16 July 2008 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with a prosecutor’s office, complaining about his ill-treatment the evening before.', '8.  On 17 and 23 July 2008 the applicant was examined by forensic doctors who reported that he had scratches and bruises on his face, chest and right foot. The doctors concluded that the injuries could have been caused by blows with a blunt object with a limited surface area, possibly in the way described by the applicant.', '9.  On 25 July 2008 a prosecutor from the Ialoveni prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded. The prosecutor’s office reached this conclusion on the basis of statements made by the accused police officers, who submitted that they had searched the applicant’s house in order to find his son. They alleged that the search had been conducted with the applicant’s permission, but that the applicant had kept insulting them during the search. Because of the way the applicant had been behaving, the accused police officers had decided to take him to the police station. His injuries had been caused as a result of him putting up resistance.', '10.  On 29 October 2008 a hierarchically superior prosecutor quashed the above decision and ordered a re-investigation of the circumstances of the case.', '11.  On 21 November 2008 a prosecutor from the Ialoveni prosecutor’s office again dismissed the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded, on similar grounds as the first time. The applicant appealed, but his appeal was rejected by a hierarchically superior prosecutor on 31 March 2009. The applicant appealed to an investigating judge.', '12.  In the meantime, the Ialoveni prosecutor’s office initiated administrative proceedings against the applicant on charges of having insulted the accused police officers and having resisted arrest.

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Košice.', '5.  On 15 December 1999 the applicant brought an action against his former employer, a private company, in the Košice District Court (Okresný súd). He sought a judicial order for payment of compensation in respect of outstanding wages, leave pay, severance pay and a food allowance. The action was filed under the number 12C 1730/99.', '6.  On 4 January 2000 the District Court exempted the applicant from the obligation to pay court fees. On the same day, it requested the defendant to submit observations in reply. The defendant company replied on 10 February 2000 submitting, inter alia, that the reason why it had not paid the amounts claimed was lack of means.', \"7.  On 24 February 2000 the District Court requested the applicant to comment on the defendant's observations in reply which the applicant did on 20 March 2000.\", \"8.  In letters of 20 March and 25 July 2000 and 29 January 2001 the applicant demanded that, in view of the defendant's admission, the District Court determine the matter promptly.\", \"9.  On 14 September 2000 the District Court held a hearing at which the defendant expressly acknowledged the existence and amount of its debt. However, it remained to be clarified whether the amount was gross or net. The hearing was adjourned, the defendant being invited to submit copies of the applicant's salary records. The defendant submitted them on 2 October 2000.\", '10.  On 3 April and 16 October 2001 the District Court held further hearings. At the former hearing the applicant withdrew a part of the claim on the ground that the defendant had paid a part of his outstanding wages. Following the latter hearing, on the same day, the District Court determined the action. It first of all discontinued the proceedings in respect of the part of the claim that had been withdrawn. It then granted the remaining part of the claim for outstanding wages. The District Court finally ruled that the claim for leave pay, severance pay and a food allowance would be determined in a separate set of proceedings.', '11.  The statutory thirty-day time-limit for finalising the written version of the judgment of 16 October 2001 was extended by decision of the president of the District Court and it was finally sent to the parties on 13 December 2001. In the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final and binding on 31 January 2002.', '12.  The applicant subsequently commissioned a judicial enforcement officer (súdny exekútor) to enforce the order for payment of the outstanding wages. On 13 June 2002 the officer notified the defendant officially that the enforcement proceedings had commenced.', '13.  On 8 February 2002 the case file concerning the separate set of proceedings opened pursuant to the judgment of 16 October 2001 was assigned to a new judge and on 3 October 2002 it was registered under a new file number 19C 1131/02.', \"14.  Following another request by the applicant that the case be determined swiftly, the District Court scheduled hearings for 12 December 2002 and 18 March and 29 April 2003. They were adjourned owing to the absence of the defendant's representative, who submitted an apology on 4 March 2003.\", '15.  On 13 January 2004 the District Court held another hearing at which the defendant acknowledged the outstanding claims. Following the hearing, on the same day, the District Court granted the remainder of the action. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and binding on 29 March 2004. The applicant subsequently requested its judicial enforcement.', '16.  In a letter of 2 August 2004 the enforcement officer informed the applicant that the defendant company could not be located at its registered address and that no movable or immovable assets belonging to it had been traced. He proposed that the enforcement be discontinued.', '17.  On 24 April 2001 the applicant lodged a petition (podnet) under Article 130 § 3 of the Constitution with the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd). He contended that his action of 1999 had not been determined “without unjustified delay” as guaranteed by Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution.', \"18.  On 13 March 2002 the Constitutional Court discontinued the proceedings. It was noted that the proceedings under file number 12C 1730/99 at which the petition was aimed had already been concluded by the judgment of 16 October 2001. The remainder of the action of 1999 was being determined in the other set of proceedings under file number 19C 1131/02. In these circumstances, the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay had to be considered as fulfilled. Relying on its established practice, the Constitutional Court found that the applicant therefore was no longer justified in having a ruling on his petition.\", '19.  On 2 October 2002 the applicant filed a fresh complaint (sťažnosť) under Article 127 of the Constitution with the Constitutional Court arguing that his action of 1999, as a whole, had not been determined without unjustified delay. He sought an order for an acceleration of the proceedings and 50,000 Slovakian korunas[1] (SKK) by way of just satisfaction.', '20.  In a decision of 22 January 2003 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible in so far as it concerned the proceedings under file number 12C 1730/99, observing that those proceedings had already ended in 2001. It further declared the complaint admissible in so far as it concerned the proceedings under file number 19C 1131/02.', \"21.  In a judgment (nález) of 21 May 2003 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant's right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings under file number 19C 1131/02. It ordered the District Court to proceed with the matter speedily and awarded the applicant SKK 15,000[2] in just satisfaction. The Constitutional Court formally reviewed only the part of the proceedings which had commenced in 2002 further to the judgment of October 2001. It “took notice” of the fact that the action as such had been lodged in 1999. No delays could be imputed to the applicant and the District Court had been completely inactive between 8 January and 3 October 2002. The amount of the just satisfaction was determined on an equitable basis with reference to Article 41 of the Convention.\"], 'applicants': ['BOHUCKY'], 'defendants': ['SLOVAKIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['10', '12', '13', '6', '9']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 5, 6, 8, 9], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 5, 6, 8, 9], 'explained_indices': [0, 3, 2, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 9, 4, 1, 6, 8, 5, 7], 'explained_distances': [2.9778108e-05, -0.00010666065, -0.0001461769, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.00023017079, -0.000558462, -0.0006752857, -0.0026671211, -0.0031003621, -0.0040813005, -0.006159015], 'number_of_sentences': 18, 'article_id': 2, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Plovdiv.', '11.  On 14 August 1992 the applicant bought a car from a Mr I.G.', '12.  On 14 September 1992 the car was impounded by the police who explained to the applicant that it had been stolen. On 17 September 1992 the applicant requested the return of the car but received no reply.', \"13.  On 30 September 1992 a criminal investigation was opened by the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office against a Mr N.P. for forgery of customs' declarations for the importation of cars, one of which was the applicant's. The prosecutor in charge of the case ordered that the car be held as a piece of evidence.\", '14.  In October and November 1992 the applicant four times requested from the prosecution authorities the return of his car, but received no reply.', \"15.  On 30 November 1992 the car was handed over to the Plovdiv Customs Administration by order of the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office. On 29 January 1993 the head of the Plovdiv Customs Administration made a penal order whereby he confiscated the car on the ground that it had been illegally imported into the country.\", '16.  The applicant appealed against the penal order to the Plovdiv District Court. In a judgment of 28 July 1993 that court quashed the order and on 18 August 1993 the car was returned to the applicant.', \"17.  On 22 November 1993 the applicant brought an action for damages against the Plovdiv Customs Administration and the Chief Prosecutor's Office, complaining that the impounding of his car and the unlawful order for its confiscation had prevented him from using it during a period of eleven months.\", '18.  Noting that the applicant had failed to adduce written evidence in support of his allegations, the Plovdiv District Court instructed him to do so within seven days. The applicant complied with these instructions and the court set the case down for hearing.', \"19.  The first hearing took place on 24 March 1994. The court noted the absence of a representative of one of the defendants, the Chief Prosecutor's Office, and ordered that it be summoned for the next hearing. The applicant's lawyer requested the court to subpoena as a witness the prosecutor who had ordered the car to be handed over to the Customs Administration. The court rejected the request by an order of 28 March 1994, holding that the prosecutor's actions could be proved through the official documents he had made and that his testimony would therefore be superfluous.\", \"20.  The second hearing was held on 13 June 1994. No representative of the Chief Prosecutor's Office appeared but a prosecutor was present in his capacity of “special party” to the proceedings. The “special party” prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed in order to take into account the pending criminal investigation against Mr N.P., as it related to the same car. In particular, there was information that the number on the engine and on the chassis of the car had been forged and that it had been illegally imported. The applicant's lawyer agreed and requested that the actions against the Chief Prosecutor's Office and against the Customs Administration be severed. The court refused to sever the actions and acceded to the request for staying the proceedings, finding that there existed criminal elements the determination of which was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute before it, within the meaning of Article 182 § 1 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the CCP”).\", \"21.  On 20 June 1994 the applicant appealed against the order for staying the proceedings to the Plovdiv Regional Court. He argued that the outcome of the criminal investigation had nothing to do with the civil proceedings. Moreover, there were no criminal elements whose determination was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute, as the prosecution authorities had transmitted the car to the customs authorities, thus excluding it from the evidence in the criminal investigation. The appeal was filed with the Plovdiv District Court. Noting that the applicant had not paid the requisite fee, the Plovdiv District Court refused to proceed with the appeal, instructing the applicant to pay the fee. The applicant did so and on 26 July 1994, after the Customs Administration had filed its answer, the Plovdiv District Court forwarded the appeal to the Plovdiv Regional Court. In a final order of 26 September 1994 the Plovdiv Regional Court dismissed the appeal, confirming the lower court's holding that there existed criminal elements whose determination was decisive for the outcome of the civil dispute, within the meaning of Article 182 § 1 (d) of the CCP. In particular, the car bought by the applicant had been impounded as a piece of evidence. The fact that later it had later been delivered to the customs authorities did not change that. Nor was it significant that the criminal proceedings were against a third party and that the penal order against the applicant had been quashed, because the applicant could still suffer the negative consequences of the criminal proceedings, e.g. the forfeiture of the car.\", \"22.  On 21 December 1995 the applicant's lawyer requested the Plovdiv District Court to resume the proceedings. In view of the request, on 27 December 1995 the court sent a letter to the Plovdiv Regional Investigation Service, asking whether the criminal investigation against Mr N.P. had been completed. The Investigation Service informed the court that the proceedings were still pending.\", '23.  In the following years the Plovdiv District Court made several inquiries about the stage reached in the investigation against Mr N.P. By letters of 27 February 1996, 22 September 1997, 1 October 1998 and 27 November 2000 the Plovdiv Regional Investigation Service informed the court that the criminal proceedings were still pending, without specifying whether it was undertaking any investigative actions.', \"24.  Following a further inquiry by the court, the Plovdiv Regional Investigation Service notified it by a letter of 13 August 2001 that the case had been sent to the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office on 6 July 2001. Taking into consideration that the investigation was still pending, by an order of 20 August 2001 the Plovdiv District Court refused to resume the proceedings. It seems that there was no activity during the period between 1995‑2001 in the criminal investigation against Mr N.P.\", \"25.  On 26 November 2001 the Plovdiv District Prosecutor's Office discontinued the criminal proceedings against Mr N.P.\", \"26.  The Plovdiv District Court then resumed the proceedings and held a hearing on 28 March 2002. The applicant requested a change in the names of the defendants, as during the time when the proceedings had been stayed the Chief Prosecutor's Office had been renamed the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Plovdiv Customs Administration had become the Customs Agency at the Ministry of Finance. The applicant also increased the amount of his claim for damages and requested leave to call one witness. The defendant Prosecutor's Office requested the court to include the case-file of the investigation against Mr N.P. in the record. The court acceded to all of the parties' requests and adjourned the case.\", '27.  Three hearings listed for 7 and 21 May and 4 June 2002 did not take place because the Customs Agency had not been duly summoned.', '28.  A hearing listed for 2 July 2002 failed to take place because the Customs Agency, despite being duly summoned, did not send a representative. Its counsel requested the court in writing to adjourn the case because he was ill and could not attend.', '29.  The court held a hearing on 10 September 2002. The applicant and his lawyer did not appear. The court found that the case was ready for adjudication and reserved judgment.', \"30.  On 13 September 2002 the applicant's lawyer requested the court to reopen the oral proceedings, as he had been unable to organise his defence prior to the 10 September 2002 hearing because between 15 August and 10 September 2002 the case‑file had been sent to the Ministry of Justice in Sofia and he could not therefore prepare for the hearing. The court acceded to his request and scheduled a hearing for 22 October 2002.\", \"31.  The last hearing before the Plovdiv District Court was held on 22 October 2002. The court heard the applicant's witness and the parties' closing arguments.\", \"32.  In a judgment of 28 November 2002 the Plovdiv District Court partly allowed the applicant's claim for damages against the Customs Agency, awarding him 1,000 Bulgarian levs, and dismissed his claim against the Prosecutor's Office.\", '33.  On 12 December 2002 the applicant appealed against the judgment to the Plovdiv Regional Court.', \"34.  The Plovdiv Regional Court held a hearing on 3 June 2003. The applicant and the Customs Agency did not appear. The Prosecutor's Office requested the court to include in the record the case‑file of the administrative case in which the Plovdiv District Court had quashed the penal order for the confiscation of the applicant's car. The court granted the request and adjourned the case until 23 October 2003.\", \"35.  A hearing took place on 23 October 2003. The case‑file of the administrative case was not produced, because it had already been destroyed in the court's archive. The court adjourned the case until 27 January 2004.\", '36.

The treaty included a secret additional protocol, approved on 23 August 1939 and amended on 28 September 1939, whereby Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to settle the map of their “spheres of influence” in the event of a future “territorial and political rearrangement” of the territories of the then independent countries of central and eastern Europe, including the three Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. After Germany’s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and the subsequent start of the Second World War, the Soviet Union began exerting considerable pressure on the governments of the Baltic States with a view to taking control of those countries pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its additional protocol.', '13.  Following an ultimatum to allow an unlimited number of Soviet troops to be stationed in the Baltic countries, on 16-17 June 1940 the Soviet army invaded Latvia and the other two independent States. The government of Latvia was removed from office, and a new government was formed under the direction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (“the CPSU”), the USSR’s only party. From 21 July to 3 August 1940 the Soviet Union completed the annexation of Latvia, which became part of the USSR under the name “Soviet Socialist Republic of Latvia” (“Latvian SSR”).', '14.  The applicant was born in Riga into a Russian-speaking family. In 1971 she joined the Communist Party of Latvia (“the CPL”) while studying at the University of Latvia in Riga. The CPL was in fact a regional branch of the CPSU. From 1972 to 1990 the applicant worked as a lecturer at the University of Latvia. Throughout this period she was a member of the CPL.', '15.  In the late 1980s there was considerable social pressure in Latvia, as in other east European countries, for the democratisation of political life. As a result of the newly introduced freedom of expression in the territory of the Soviet Union, mass political movements were formed in Latvia, as well as in the other Baltic States, condemning the annexation of the country, asserting the need to construct a new society based, inter alia, on Latvian identity and values, and emphasising the need to restore State independence.', '16.  The first independent elections under the Soviet regime took place on Latvian territory in March 1990. The applicant was elected to the Supreme Council (Augstākā Padome) of the Latvian SSR as a representative for the Pļavnieki constituency in Riga. She subsequently joined the CPL’s local branch. In April 1990 this branch selected her to attend the CPL’s 25th Congress, where she was elected to the party’s Central Committee for Supervision and Audit. According to copies of that committee’s minutes, the applicant was a member of a sub-committee responsible for supervising the implementation of decisions and activities arising from the CPL programme.', '17.  At the same congress, a group of delegates expressed their disagreement with the CPL’s general policy, which remained loyal to the Soviet Union and the CPSU. According to those delegates, the CPL was opposed to any democratisation of public life and sought to maintain the status quo of the Soviet rule. These delegates publicly announced their withdrawal from the CPL and established a new party, the “Independent Communist Party of Latvia”, which immediately declared its support for Latvian independence and for a multi-party political system. The applicant did not join the dissident delegates and remained with the CPL.', '18.  On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council adopted a Declaration on the Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia, which declared Latvia’s incorporation into the USSR unlawful and void and restored legal force to the fundamental provisions of the Latvian Constitution (Satversme) of 1922. However, paragraph 5 of the Declaration introduced a transition period, aimed at a gradual restoration of genuine State sovereignty as each institutional tie with the USSR was severed. During that transition period, various provisions of the Constitution of the Latvian SSR would remain in force. A special governmental commission was given responsibility for negotiating with the Soviet Union on the basis of the Russo-Latvian Peace Treaty of 11 August 1920.\\nThe above-mentioned Declaration was adopted by 139 out of a total of 201 Supreme Council members, with one abstention. Fifty-seven members of the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc (“Equal Rights”, in fact the CPL group), including the applicant, did not vote. On the same day, 4 May 1990, the Central Committee of the CPL adopted a resolution strongly criticising the Declaration and calling on the President of the Soviet Union to intervene.', '19.  On 7 May 1990 the Supreme Council approved the government of the independent Republic of Latvia.', '20.  On the evening of 12 January 1991 the Soviet army launched military operations against the neighbouring country of Lithuania, whose government had been formed in the same way as the Latvian government. Soviet troops entered the television tower of Vilnius and the headquarters of Lithuanian public television, and also tried to take the seats of the Lithuanian parliament and other authorities. Massive crowds, made up of Lithuanian citizens, came to the rescue of the institutions of the newly independent Lithuania. Thirteen Lithuanian civilians were killed and hundreds injured during the clash with the Soviet army.', '21.  The parties disagree as to who was responsible for the deaths during the events in Vilnius on 12-13 January 1991. According to the respondent Government, the CPSU was directly responsible for those deaths, in that it had full and effective control of the Soviet troops. The applicant contested the Government’s version, stating that the Soviet army’s aggression against the Lithuanian government and the Lithuanian people was not a proven fact; in this connection, she submitted a copy of a Russian newspaper article which alleged that it had been the Lithuanian independence supporters themselves who fired into the crowd with the aim of discrediting the Soviet army.', '22.  At the same time, an attempted coup was launched in Latvia. On 13 January 1991 the plenum of the CPL Central Committee called for the resignation of the Latvian government, the dissolution of the Supreme Council and the assumption of full powers by the Latvian Public Rescue Committee (Vislatvijas Sabiedriskās glābšanas komiteja), set up on the same date by several organisations including the CPL. On 15 January 1991 this committee announced that the Supreme Council and the government were stripped of their respective powers and declared that it was assuming full powers. After causing the loss of five civilian lives and injuries to thirty-four persons during armed clashes in Riga, this attempted coup failed.', '23.  According to the respondent Government, it was absolutely clear that the attempted coup in Latvia was launched by the CPL against the background of the Vilnius events, in the hope that Soviet troops would also invade Riga to support the pro-Soviet coup. The applicant submitted that, at the material time, a series of public demonstrations had been held in Latvia to protest against the rise in food prices introduced by the Latvian government; those demonstrations were thus the main reason for the events of January 1991. The applicant also emphasised that, in their respective statements of 13 and 15 January 1991, the plenum of the CPL Central Committee and the Latvian Public Rescue Committee had not only called for and announced the removal of the Latvian authorities, but had also stated that early elections would be held for the Supreme Council.', '24.  On 3 March 1991 a national plebiscite was held on Latvian territory. Electors had to reply to a question worded as follows: “Do you support a democratic and politically independent Republic of Latvia?” According to figures supplied by the Government, 87.5% of all residents registered on the electoral roll voted, and 73.6% of them replied in the affirmative. According to the Government, this was a genuine national referendum, confirming the support of the overwhelming majority of the Latvian population for the idea of national independence. The applicant maintains that it was a simple consultative vote and contests the above-mentioned turnout, and thus the very legitimacy of the plebiscite.', '25.  On 19 August 1991 there was an attempted coup in Moscow. The self-proclaimed “National State of Emergency Committee” announced that Mr Gorbachev, President of the USSR, was suspended from his duties, declared itself the sole ruling authority and imposed a state of emergency “in certain regions of the USSR”.', '26.  On the same day the Central Committee and the Riga Committee of the CPL declared their support for the National State of Emergency Committee and set up an “operational group” to provide assistance to it. According to the Government, on 20 August 1991 the CPL, the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc and various other organisations signed and disseminated an appeal entitled “Godājamie Latvijas iedzīvotāji!” (“Honourable residents of Latvia!”), urging the population to comply with the requirements of the state of emergency and not to oppose the measures imposed by the National State of Emergency Committee in Moscow. According to the applicant, the CPL’s participation in all those events has not been proved; in particular, the members of the Līdztiesība bloc were taking part in parliamentary debates over two consecutive days and were not even aware that such an appeal was to be issued.', '27.  This coup also failed. On 21 August 1991, the Latvian Supreme Council enacted a constitutional law on the status of the Republic of Latvia as a State and proclaimed the country’s immediate and absolute independence. Paragraph 5 of the Declaration of 4 May 1990, concerning the transition period, was repealed.', '28.  By a decision of 23 August 1991, the Supreme Council declared the CPL unconstitutional. The following day, the party’s activities were suspended and the Minister of Justice was instructed “to investigate the unlawful activities of the CPL and to put forward ... a motion on the possibility of authorising its continued operations”. On the basis of the proposal by the Minister of Justice, the Supreme Council ordered the party’s dissolution on 10 September 1991.', '29.  In the meantime, on 22 August 1991 the Supreme Council set up a parliamentary committee to investigate the involvement of members of the Līdztiesība bloc in the coup. On the basis of that committee’s final report, on 9 July 1992 the Supreme Council revoked fifteen members’ right to sit in Parliament. The applicant was not one of those concerned.', '30.  In February 1993 the applicant became chairperson of the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia (Kustība par sociālo taisnīgumu un līdztiesību Latvijā), which later became a political party, Līdztiesība (“Equal rights”).', '31.  On 5 and 6 June 1993 parliamentary elections were held in accordance with the restored Constitution of 1922. For the first time since Latvian independence had been regained, the population elected the parliament (Saeima), which took over from the Supreme Council. It was at that point that the applicant’s term of office as a member of parliament expired. As a result of the Latvian authorities’ refusal to include her on the residents’ register as a Latvian citizen, she was unable to take part in those elections, in the following parliamentary elections held in 1995, or in the municipal elections of 1994. Following an appeal by the applicant, the courts recognised her as holding Latvian nationality by right in January 1996, on the ground of her being a descendant of a person who had possessed Latvian nationality before 1940. The courts therefore instructed the electoral authorities to register the applicant and to supply her with the appropriate documents.', '32.  By a final judgment of the Supreme Court of 27 July 1995, A.R. and O.P., formerly the most senior officials of the CPL, were found guilty of attempting to overthrow the legitimate authorities of independent Latvia by violent means. The judgment accepted, inter alia, the following circumstances as historical facts:\\n(a)  Having failed to obtain a majority on the Supreme Council in the democratic elections of March 1990, the CPL and the other organisations listed in section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act decided to take the unconstitutional route and set up the Latvian Public Rescue Committee, which attempted to usurp power and to dissolve the Supreme Council and the legitimate government of Latvia. Such actions were contrary not only to Article 2 of the 1922 Constitution, which stated that sovereign power was vested in the people, but also to Article 2 of the Constitution of the Latvian SSR, which conferred authority to act on behalf of the people on elected councils (soviets) alone.\\n(b)  The Central Committee of the CPL provided financial support to the special unit of the Soviet police which was entirely responsible for the fatal incidents of January 1991 (see paragraphs 22-23 above); at the same time, the Latvian Public Rescue Committee publicly expressed its support for this militarised body.\\n(c)  During the coup of August 1991 the Central Committee of the CPL openly declared its support for the National State of Emergency Committee, set up an “operational group” with a view to providing assistance to it and published an appeal calling on the public to comply with the regime imposed by this self-proclaimed and unconstitutional body.', '33.  On 25 January 1997 the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia submitted to the Riga Electoral Commission a list of ten candidates for the forthcoming municipal elections of 9 March 1997. The applicant was one of those candidates. In accordance with the requirements of the Municipal Elections Act, she signed the list and attached a written statement confirming that she was not one of the persons referred to in section 9 of that Act. Under the terms of the Act, individuals who had “actively participated” (darbojušās) in the CPSU, the CPL and several other named organisations after 13 January 1991 were not entitled to stand for office. In a letter sent on the same day, the applicant informed the Electoral Commission that she had been a member of the CPL’s Pļavnieki branch and of its Central Committee for Supervision and Audit until 10 September 1991, the date of the CPL’s official dissolution. However, she argued that the restrictions mentioned above were not applicable to her, since they were contrary to Articles 2 and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.', '34.  By a decision of 11 February 1997, the Riga Electoral Commission registered the list submitted by the applicant. At the elections of 9 March 1997 this list obtained four of the sixty seats on Riga City Council (Rīgas Dome). The applicant was one of those elected.', '35.  With a view to participating in the parliamentary elections of 3 October 1998, the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia formed a coalition with the Party of National Harmony (Tautas Saskaņas partija), the Latvian Socialist Party (Latvijas Sociālistiskā partija) and the Russian Party (Krievu partija). The four parties formed a united list entitled “Party of National Harmony”. The applicant appeared on this list as a candidate for the constituencies of Riga and Vidzeme.\\nOn 28 July 1998 the list was submitted to the Central Electoral Commission for registration. In accordance with the requirements of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the applicant signed the list and attached to it a written statement identical to the one she had submitted prior to the municipal elections. As she had done for the 1997 elections, she likewise sent a letter to the Central Electoral Commission explaining her situation and arguing that the restrictions in question were incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.', '36.  On 29 July 1998 the Central Electoral Commission suspended registration of the list on the ground that the applicant’s candidacy did not meet the requirements of the Parliamentary Elections Act. Not wishing to jeopardise the entire list’s prospects of being registered, the applicant withdrew her candidacy, after which the list was immediately registered.', '37.  By a letter of 7 August 1998, the President of the Central Electoral Commission asked the Prosecutor General to examine the legitimacy of the applicant’s election to the Riga City Council.', '38.  By a decision of 31 August 1998, a copy of which was sent to the Central Electoral Commission, the Office of the Prosecutor General (Ģenerālprokuratūra) noted that the applicant had not committed any act defined as an offence in the Criminal Code. The decision stated that, although the applicant had provided false information to the Riga Electoral Commission regarding her participation in the CPL, there was nothing to prove that she had done so with the specific objective of misleading the commission. In that connection, the prosecutors considered that the statement by the applicant, appended to the list of candidates for the elections of 9 March 1997, was to be read in conjunction with her explanatory letter of 25 January 1997.', '39.  On 14 January 1999 the Office of the Prosecutor General applied to the Riga Regional Court for a finding that the applicant had participated in the activities of the CPL after 13 January 1991. The prosecutors attached the following documents to their submission: the applicant’s letter of 25 January 1997; the minutes of the meeting of 26 January 1991 of the CPL’s Central Committee for Supervision and Audit; the minutes of the joint meeting of 27 March 1991 of the Central Committee for Supervision and Audit and the municipal and regional committees for supervision and audit; and the annexes to those minutes, indicating the structure and composition of the said committee and a list of the members of the Audit Committee at 1 July 1991.', '40.  Following adversarial proceedings, the Riga Regional Court allowed the prosecutors’ request in a judgment of 15 February 1999. It considered that the documents in its possession clearly attested to the applicant’s active participation in the party’s activities after the critical date, and that the evidence provided by the applicant was insufficient to refute this finding. Consequently, the court dismissed the applicant’s arguments to the effect that she was only formally a member of the CPL, did not participate in the meetings of its Central Committee for Supervision and Audit and that, accordingly, she could not be held to have “acted”, “been a militant” or “actively participated” (darboties) in the party’s activities.', '41.  The applicant appealed against this judgment to the Civil Division of the Supreme Court. On 12 November 1999 the Civil Division began examining the appeal. At the oral hearing, the applicant submitted that the content of the above-mentioned minutes of 26 January and 27 March 1991, referring to her by name, could not be held against her since on both those dates she had been carrying out her duties in the Latvian Supreme Council and not in the CPL. After hearing evidence from two witnesses who stated that the applicant had indeed been present at the Supreme Council, the Division suspended examination of the case in order to enable the applicant to submit more cogent evidence in support of her statements, such as a record of parliamentary debates or minutes of the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc’s meetings. However, as the above-mentioned minutes had not been preserved by the Parliamentary Record Office, the applicant was never able to produce such evidence.', '42.  By a judgment of 15 December 1999, the Civil Division dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It stated that the evidence gathered by the Office of the Prosecutor General was sufficient to conclude that the applicant had actively taken part in the CPL’s activities after 13 January 1991. The Division further noted that the CPL’s dissolution had been ordered “in accordance with the interests of the Latvian State in a specific historical and political situation” and that the international conventions relied on by the applicant allowed for justified limitations on the exercise of electoral rights.', '43.  Following the Civil Division’s judgment, enforceable from the date of its delivery, the applicant was disqualified from electoral office and lost her seat as a member of Riga City Council.', '44.  The applicant applied to the Senate of the Supreme Court to have the Civil Division’s judgment quashed. She stressed, inter alia, the restriction’s incompatibility with Article 11 of the Convention. By a final order of 7 February 2000 the Senate declared the appeal inadmissible. In the Senate’s opinion, the proceedings in question were limited to a single strictly-defined objective, namely a finding as to whether or not the applicant had actively taken part in the CPL’s activities after 13 January 1991. The Senate concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to analyse the legal consequences of this finding, on the ground that this was irrelevant to the finding itself. In addition, the Senate noted that any such analysis would involve an examination of the Latvian legislation’s compatibility with constitutional and international law, which did not come within the final appeal court’s jurisdiction.', '45.  Proceedings similar to those against the applicant were also instituted against a small number of other CPL activists, not all of whom were recognised by the courts as having “actively participated” in the activities of the CPL after January 1991.', '46.  The next parliamentary elections took place on 5 October 2002. With a view to taking part in those elections, the Līdztiesība party, chaired by the applicant, formed an alliance entitled “For Human Rights in a United Latvia” (Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā, abbreviated to PCTVL) with two other parties, the Party of National Harmony and the Socialist Party. The alliance’s electoral manifesto expressly referred to the need to abolish the restrictions on the electoral rights of persons who had been actively involved in the CPL after 13 January 1991.', '47.  In spring 2002 the Executive Council of the Līdztiesība party put the applicant forward as a candidate for the 2002 elections; the Council of the PCTVL alliance approved this nomination. Shortly afterwards, however, on 16 May 2002, the outgoing parliament rejected a motion to repeal section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act. The alliance’s council, which was fully aware of the applicant’s situation and feared that her candidacy would prevent registration of the PCTVL’s entire list, changed its opinion and decided not to include her name on the list of candidates. The applicant then decided to submit a separate list containing only one name, her own, entitled “Party of National Harmony”.', '48.  On 23 July 2002 the PCTVL electoral alliance submitted its list to the Central Electoral Commission. In all, it contained the names of seventy-seven candidates for Latvia’s five constituencies. On the same date the applicant asked the commission to register her own list, for the constituency of Kurzeme alone. As she had done for the 1998 elections, she attached to her list a written statement to the effect that the disputed restrictions were incompatible with the Constitution and with Latvia’s international undertakings. On 25 July 2002 the commission registered both lists.', '49.  By a decision of 7 August 2002, the Central Electoral Commission, referring to the Civil Division’s judgment of 15 December 1999, removed the applicant from its list. In addition, having noted that the applicant had been the only candidate on the “Party of National Harmony” list and that, following her removal, there were no other names, the commission decided to cancel the registration of that list.', '50.  At the elections of 5 October 2002, the PCTVL alliance’s list obtained 18.94% of the votes and won twenty-five seats in Parliament.', '51.  Latvia became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. Prior to that date, on the basis of the European Parliament Elections Act (Eiropas Parlamenta vēlēšanu likums) of 12 February 2004, the applicant was granted permission to run in those elections. They were held on 12 June 2004 and the applicant was elected as a member of the European Parliament.'], 'applicants': ['ZDANOKA'], 'defendants': ['LATVIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-3', '34'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-3': ['106', '112', '113', '114', '115', '120', '123', '124', '17', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '32', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '51', '54', '55', '61', '62', '63', '75', '96', '97']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 32, 23, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 31, 22, 20, 39, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 40], 'explained_distances': [0.60670006, 0.38357443, 0.27596158, 0.20845187, 0.092838705, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364, 0.032045364], 'number_of_sentences': 41, 'article_id': 1, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Nowy Sącz.', '6.  On 27 January 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of car theft and subsequently remanded in custody. On an unspecified later date he was charged with selling drugs. The charges concerning car theft were severed to be dealt with in another set of proceedings.', '7.  On 15 February 2006 a certain JH, a minor[1], was questioned by the police in respect of the car theft. On 27 February 2006 JH was questioned by the police in respect of the charge of selling drugs between September 2005 and 10 February 2006. He admitted that he had been selling drugs which he had received from the applicant. The questioning took place in the presence of a psychologist.', '8.  In her report dated 1 March 2006 the psychologist observed that JH’s cognitive processes had functioned at the level commensurate to his age. She noted that his interpretation of the facts could have been slightly changed on account of his fear of the consequences of his acts. There could also have been minor inconsistencies with regard to the amount of drugs sold by the applicant to other persons. She also noted that JH had willingly presented the facts related to the drug transactions involving him and other persons.', '9.  JH was heard by the police as a juvenile suspect but no preventive measures were applied. The charges against him were to be examined separately by the Division for Family and Minors of the Nowy Sącz District Court. That court ordered an inquiry to be carried out at his home. On 10 July 2006 the report of the inquiry was submitted to the District Court. According to the report, JH had left Poland for the USA on 17 March 2006 and his parents did not know his address or telephone number. JH had not informed his parents of his plans to leave Poland and he had merely called them from the airport.', '10.  On 7 September 2006 the District Court requested the police to establish JH’s place of residence. On 18 September 2006 the police informed the court that JH had been in Chicago as from April 2006 and that he was expected to return to Poland in the summer of 2008.', '11.  On 17 October 2006 the Nowy Sącz District Court decided not to institute proceedings against JH. It had regard to the fact that he had been in the USA since April 2006 and in those circumstances it would be impossible to apply to him the measures provided in the Juvenile Procedure Act (ustawa o postępowaniu w sprawach nieletnich).', '12.  On 19 August 2006 the prosecution filed a bill of indictment against the applicant with the Nowy Sącz Regional Court. The applicant was charged with offering drugs to a minor, JH, and with seven counts of selling drugs to JH, PK, SB, KJ, GS, TK and RG between June 2004 and 27 January 2006. The prosecutor requested the court to hear seventeen witnesses, including JH.', '13.  There were five other defendants in the case (WZ, GS, KJ, MG and TK) who were also charged with drug trafficking offences. Two of them, WZ and GS, were additionally charged with car theft. On 3 October 2006 the trial court severed the charges against MG and TK.', '14.  On 28 August 2006 the Nowy Sącz Regional Court scheduled hearing dates for 3, 9, 13, 16 and 17 October 2006. JH was summoned to testify on 9 October 2006. On 11 September 2006 JH’s mother informed the trial court that JH resided in the USA where he was attending school. She produced photocopies of the plane tickets. On 18 September 2006 the police confirmed the above and informed the court that the date of JH’s return to Poland was unknown.', '15.  On 9 October 2006 the trial court again summoned JH to give evidence on 17 October 2006. The police were asked to serve the summons or to establish the date of his return to Poland. On 13 October 2006 the police informed the court that the summons could not be served since JH was still in the USA and the date of his return remained unknown.', '16.  On 18 October 2006 the trial court again summoned JH to testify at the hearing. It also requested police assistance in establishing the date of his return to Poland. The police informed the court in their two letters of 26 October 2006 that JH was in Chicago. They notified the court that the date of his return to Poland was still unknown. They also reported that, according to the information obtained from JH’s parents, JH would remain in the USA for several years as he was attending school.', '17.  The trial court held five hearings as scheduled and one additional hearing on 15 November 2006. At the hearing held on that date the prosecutor requested the court to read out the statements JH had made to the police. The applicant and his counsel objected. They argued that those depositions were the main incriminating evidence against the applicant and that they wanted to put questions to JH at the hearing. The trial court decided that JH’s statements should be read out pursuant to Article 391 § 1 of the CCP since the witness was permanently abroad and his date of return to Poland remained unknown. It noted that in those circumstances it was not possible to grant the applicant’s request to hear JH at the hearing.', '18.  The Nowy Sącz Regional Court gave judgment on 16 November 2006. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment and a fine of PLN 2,000. It further ordered him to make a payment of PLN 5,000 to an association assisting drug addicts.', '19.  The trial court established that the applicant had sold drugs as alleged in the bill of indictment. In this respect it relied on the statements of JH who had been heard by the police as a juvenile suspect. JH stated that the applicant had sold drugs to GS, TK, SB, RG and KJ in his presence. In his evidence, he described in detail the factual circumstances of those transactions and distinguished between transactions at which he had been present from those of which he had only heard.\\nThe trial court considered JH’s evidence reliable, having regard to its detail, certainty and consistency. The reliability of his evidence was enhanced by the fact that JH had known all the defendants well and had had no motive to incriminate them. Furthermore, the trial court considered that JH’s evidence was objective since he had not concealed any facts which might have put him in a negative light as he admitted that he had been selling the drugs for the applicant to KJ, GS, PK and AB and that he had stolen the car. On 14 February 2006 JH together with the two co-accused WZ and GS had stolen a car which indicated that they had trusted each other.', '20.  The applicant pleaded not guilty and decided not to testify. He stated that he had not sold or offered drugs to other persons and had not possessed them. He refused to answer any questions from the court and the parties.', '21.  According to the trial court, the credibility of the statements given by JH was supplemented by other evidence. Those statements were not the only incriminating evidence as they were confirmed in certain respects by evidence from PK, KJ, GS and WZ. Furthermore, JH’s statements were not undermined by the findings of the psychologist who had assisted in his questioning.', '22.  In respect of witness PK, the trial court considered credible the statements which he had given during the investigation. When questioned at that stage he stated that JH had received drugs from the applicant and had been selling them to others. PK had also confirmed that JH had offered drugs to his friends. That evidence corroborated the relevant statements of JH. PK had also confirmed JH’s statement that the applicant had proposed to manufacture drugs in PK’s garage. During the trial, PK changed his version of events and denied that the applicant had supplied drugs to JH, but the trial court refused to accept his change of testimony as PK had offered no explanation for it.', '23.  KJ was a friend of JH and the applicant. The court found reliable the evidence she had given during the investigation, namely that she had bought drugs from JH, GS and WZ, and that she had offered and taken amphetamine with the applicant. The latter fact contradicted the applicant’s assertion that he had had nothing to do with drugs. At the trial, KJ denied those statements. However, the trial court noted that she had not explained the reason for the change in her testimony and considered credible her original statements. Furthermore, KJ’s testimony during the investigation was corroborated by JH’s statements. KJ denied that the applicant had sold her drugs. However, the trial court did not find this evidence reliable, having regard to the consistent statements of JH and to the lack of a motive on the part of JH to incriminate the applicant and KJ.', '24.  The trial court considered credible the statements of GS that he had purchased drugs from JH. The latter confirmed that he had been selling drugs received from the applicant to others persons, including GS. GS was also buying drugs from the applicant and selling them to others as confirmed by the statements of JH and KJ. In view of those statements, the court rejected GS’s subsequent denial at the trial that he had anything to do with drugs.', '25.  The applicant appealed. He argued that the trial court had breached criminal procedure by reading out the depositions of JH which had been made during the latter’s questioning by the police. He also submitted that the trial court had relied on JH’s statements although they had not been corroborated by other evidence in the case. The applicant lastly claimed that the court had erred in its establishment of the facts of the case.', '26.  On 17 April 2007 the Kraków Court of Appeal held a hearing and upheld the trial court’s judgment for the most part. It amended it only to the extent that it deleted one count of selling drugs by the applicant to PK since JH had stated that he had not witnessed that particular transaction.', '27.  Otherwise, the Court of Appeal found that the trial court had correctly established the facts, basing itself on a comprehensive assessment of all the evidence. It had explained why it had considered JH’s statements credible and why it had disregarded the applicant’s evidence since he had limited himself to denying the charges against him. It stressed that the applicant had not put forward any rational arguments to contest the duly substantiated findings of the trial court.', '28.  The Court of Appeal noted that JH had described precisely various details concerning the purchase of drugs from the applicant, such as the type of drugs, price, quantity, dates of transactions, form of payment, etc. It underlined that JH’s version of events, namely that he had been selling drugs received from the applicant and offering them to his friends, had been confirmed by PK and KJ during their questioning in the course of the investigation. The fact that PK, when heard at the trial, had changed his earlier version of events could not be considered credible as he had not given a plausible explanation for this change. PK had also confirmed JH’s statement that the applicant had proposed to manufacture drugs in PK’s garage but that proposal had been refused. The fact of JH’s offering drugs to friends had also been confirmed by GS and WG during their questioning in the course of the investigation.', '29.  The Court of Appeal accepted the findings of the trial court that JH, being a close acquaintance of the applicant, GS, KJ, PK, SB, TK and RG, had objectively described the applicant’s actions and that he had not been in conflict with the applicant. In his statements, JH had not concealed facts which incriminated him. He had consistently stated that GS, KJ, SB, RG and TK had purchased drugs from the applicant in his presence. He distinguished those situations from transactions at which he had not been present. The Court of Appeal also noted that before his questioning as a juvenile suspect, JH had been advised that he had the right to refuse to make statements.', '30.  As regards the lack of cross-examination of JH, the Court of Appeal stated:\\n“The allegation of the breach of procedure by the trial court is not sustainable. The appeal setting out the above allegation does not specify which provisions were breached; it would appear from the grounds of the appeal that it concerns Article 391 § 1 of the CCP, which the trial court relied on when reading out the statements of JH once it had been established that he was staying permanently (for a longer period of time) abroad and thus objectively it is impossible to hear him directly. There is no doubt in the circumstances of the case that the court made all possible procedural attempts to secure the presence of JH at the trial, and that the court took the decision to read out the statements of that witness after having established objectively and unequivocally that the precondition specified in Article 391 § 1 of the CCP had been met (his uninterrupted long stay abroad), and then only just before closing the trial. The defendant [the applicant] does not dispute that the circumstances specified in Article 391 § 1 of the CCP in respect of witness JH were correctly ascertained, admitting expressly that the witness went away and has lived abroad. In this procedural situation the trial court had the right to read out the statements of that witness, a minor, given at the time when he was questioned as a suspect (the fact that the trial court did not invoke § 2 of Article 391 of the CCP does not have any procedural significance for the justified use of the measure provided by Article 391 of the CCP in the circumstances of the case), being an exception to the principle of directness and the principle of oral proceedings – since the trial court assessed the admissibility of that evidence (reading out a witness’ statements), the circumstances in which it was obtained and the credibility of those statements by corroborating them with other evidence obtained in the case, as already explained. The parties and the defence had an opportunity to react directly to those statements [of witness JH]....”', '31.  On 22 June 2007 the applicant filed a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. He stated that the trial court had read out JH’s depositions and by doing so had prevented the applicant from putting questions to that witness. He alleged a breach of his defence rights, invoking Articles 6, 7 and 391 § 1 of the CCP and Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.', '32.  The applicant argued that the trial court and subsequently the Court of Appeal had based their verdict exclusively on JH’s evidence and had disregarded the evidence of KJ, GS and WZ as being contradictory to the former evidence. In respect of PK, the applicant argued that his statements given at the pre-trial investigation stage had to be carefully analysed since he could not confirm them at the hearing as he had been undergoing drug therapy.', '33.  The applicant claimed that the courts had not used all available means to secure the attendance of JH at the trial. Furthermore, JH had been treated leniently by the authorities as he had been allowed to leave the country despite his admission that he had been selling drugs. Lastly, the applicant informed the Supreme Court that JH had returned to Poland and that he could have been questioned in respect of the charges against the applicant.', '34.  On 24 June 2007 JH was arrested by the police for drunken driving in Poland. On 25 June 2007 he was questioned by the Zakopane District Prosecutor. On the same day the Zakopane District Court convicted him of drunken driving in summary proceedings and sentenced him to a suspended prison term and a fine. It also banned him from driving for one year. JH was further placed under the supervision of a court officer.', '35.  On 5 November 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded. It held, in so far as relevant:\\n“When formulating them [arguments in the cassation appeal] the applicant completely disregarded Article 519 of the CCP, which entitles the parties to lodge a cassation appeal exclusively against the final judgment of the second-instance court. Nonetheless, in the present case the author of the cassation appeal repeated the same assertions which he had raised earlier in an ordinary appeal, making only such modifications which supposedly complied with the requirements specified in Article 523 § 1 of the CCP. The same circumstances, which had earlier served as the basis for an assertion that the trial court had made errors in respect of its factual findings, were now being used to formulate arguments of a procedural nature. However, the assessment of their content and the reasons for the cassation appeal leads to the conclusion that as a matter of fact the author intended again to attempt to undermine the credibility of particular sources of evidence and to challenge the factual findings made on that basis. However, in the light of the binding regulation such an attempt in cassation appeal proceedings cannot be effective. (...)\\nIt cannot be overlooked that the arguments of the cassation appeal in the present case are in fact directed against the trial court’s judgment. It was the trial court which assessed the credibility of particular sources of evidence and determined the quantity of drugs which had been trafficked; it was also the Nowy Sącz Regional Court which made use of the measure provided in Article 391 of the CCP in order to disclose statements made by the then minor JH (...)\\nThe issue of the correctness of admitting and relying on JH’s statements was also subject to ordinary review by the second-instance court. The Court of Appeal could not infringe Article 391 of the CCP since it did not make use of the measure provided in it. Even now the appellant has not substantiated [his contention] that the restrictions on the opportunity to release depositions or statements by persons listed in that provisions were breached. (...) However, the digressions as to the possibility of taking evidence from JH, and the conducting of evidentiary proceedings with the participation of the defendant [the applicant] at the current stage of the proceedings, at a time when the case has finally been determined and no breach of the law (still less a manifest breach – Article 523 § 1 of the CCP) has been substantiated, do not fit within the framework of the model of cassation appeal proceedings. The repeated reliance on all those circumstances additionally reinforces the conclusion that the arguments presented in the cassation appeal constituted nothing but an attempt to circumvent the obligation stemming from Article 519 of the CCP, which stipulates that a second-instance judgment shall be the subject of a cassation appeal.”'], 'applicants': ['FĄFROWICZ'], 'defendants': ['POLAND'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '6'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['23']}, 'silver_rationales': [18], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [18], 'explained_indices': [15, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 29, 30, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 14, 0, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 4], 'explained_distances': [-0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.1003865, -0.10330099, -0.11316669, -0.11843896, -0.12499142, -0.12812823, -0.12977594, -0.13375229], 'number_of_sentences': 31, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '6.  On 19 July 2001 the Parliament of Moldova amended the 2001 Budget Act to allow the Customs Department to postpone by up to three months the levying of taxes on fuel imported into Moldova. In the evening of the same day, the leader of the communist majority in Parliament (Mr V. Stepaniuc) met with the deputy Speaker of Parliament (Mr V. Mişin) for a meal in the restaurant of a luxury hotel in Chişinău. According to the applicant newspaper, sources which preferred to remain anonymous confirmed that the meal had been paid for by “L.”, a major importer of fuel into Moldova.', \"7.  On 24 July 2001 the applicant newspaper published an article entitled “On L.'s money, communists V. Stepaniuc and V. Mişin had a big-time party (chiolhan) at 'Jolly Allon'”. The article, which included pictures of the two MPs next to the text, informed readers about the changes to the Budget Act and about the profits which those changes would bring to a few big fuel importers who had links with the Customs Department, thus allowing unfair competition. The article claimed that the postponement of tax payments constituted a form of credit by the State without interest or guarantees and rejected the explanation for the amendment given by a member of Parliament.\\nOne paragraph in the article read:\\n“One needs to note that, in the evening of the same day, at the 'Jolly Allon' (...) hotel, the communists V. Stepaniuc and V. Mişin, putting aside all proletarian decency [pudoare], had a big-time party on the money of the sharks from 'L.'. Could this party be a simple coincidence? We do not know.”\\nThe article went on to expose the legislative plans of the communist party and the resulting benefits to big fuel importers at the expense of ordinary workers.\", '8.  On 8 July 2002 Mr Stepaniuc, the leader of the Communist parliamentary faction which had, at the time, 71 votes out of a total of 101 in Parliament, lodged an action against the applicant newspaper, identifying the paragraph cited above as defamatory. He did not pay any court fee when lodging his complaint, nor did he appear in court at any stage of the proceedings or delegate any person to represent him.', \"9.  On 1 August 2002 Judge I.M., the then President of the Buiucani District Court, found that the applicant had essentially stated that Mr Stepaniuc “had voted for laws in the interest of some private companies and then had a party on their money”. It denounced the use of pure rumour as a basis for journalism and found that the applicant newspaper had acted in bad faith. The court took note of the “vehement attack” on Mr Stepaniuc, the large readership of the newspaper and the “degree of moral and psychological suffering” caused. In addition, the court found that Mr Stepaniuc's position as a member of Parliament and leader of a parliamentary faction “increased the degree of moral damage” which led to the imposition of maximum liability.\", \"10.  The court accepted Mr Stepaniuc's claim and ordered the applicant newspaper, pursuant to Articles 7 and 7 § 1 of the Civil Code, to publish an apology and to pay the plaintiff the maximum damages allowed by law and the court fees (a total of 3,690 Moldovan lei (MDL), equal to 278 euros (EUR) at the time). According to the applicant newspaper, the court had conducted one hearing which lasted less than 15 minutes and no questions had been put to the applicant newspaper.\", '11.  In its appeal the applicant newspaper submitted that the impugned phrases had amounted to value-judgments which could not be proved and that these opinions had been based on facts, namely the party which had taken place at the hotel in question on the date mentioned in the article, which was not disputed, and the modifications to the law adopted by Parliament. Moreover, in view of the length of time that had passed after the publication of the article, it had been impossible for the applicant to prove that the persons had been seen at the hotel restaurant, where they had had a party, or verify the source of payment for it. The applicant newspaper also argued that Judge I.M. lacked independence and impartiality because he was a friend of Mr Stepaniuc and had been appointed President of the Buiucani District Court by the Communist Party parliamentary group. The majority of the defamation cases between Flux and Mr Stepaniuc had been examined by him personally and his decisions were stereotyped and did not give sufficient reasons. In other defamation cases between Flux and representatives of the Government, Judge I.M. had always ruled in favour of the latter and had awarded them the maximum amount provided for by law.', \"12.  On 30 January 2003 the Chişinău Regional Court found that the applicant newspaper had missed the time-limit for lodging its appeal against that judgment but went on to examine the substance of the case. It upheld the lower court's judgment, finding that its decision had been lawful and reasoned. The court did not respond to the applicant's complaint about the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge I.M. The hearing lasted less than 10 minutes and the applicant newspaper was not asked any questions.\", \"13.  In an appeal in cassation the applicant newspaper relied on Article 10 of the Convention and on the distinction which the lower courts had failed to make between value-judgments and factual statements. Moreover, the courts had never heard evidence from the plaintiff, and had not taken into account his public-figure status, which should have limited the scope of interference with the applicant's freedom of expression, or the special role played by the press in a democratic society. Finally, the lower courts had failed to respond to most of the points raised by the applicant.\", \"14.  On 1 April 2003 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgments of the lower courts, finding that they had been lawful and corresponded to the evidence in the case. No comment was made about Judge I.M.'s alleged lack of impartiality.\"], 'applicants': ['FLUX'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['10', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['10'], 'court_assessment_references': {'10': ['10', '11', '27', '7']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 5, 6], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 5, 6], 'explained_indices': [2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3], 'explained_distances': [0.03977388, -0.023127437, -0.047139704, -0.047139704, -0.047139704, -0.047139704, -0.047139704, -0.047139704, -0.060985386, -0.07002711], 'number_of_sentences': 10, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1954 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in the prison of Peqin. At the time of the events described below, the applicant was the head of the traffic police at the police commissariat of Bajram Curri, a city in the north east of Albania.', '7.  In 1997 the country suffered a total breakdown of governmental institutional structures as a result of the collapse of a number of so-called “pyramid schemes”. Armories were looted by civilians, public order collapsed and the country was plunged into anarchy and chaos for a number of months.', '8.  In 1998 public order was marginally restored but security problems continued, particularly in the north-eastern part of the country, including Bajram Curri.', '9.  On 12 September 1998 at about 9.15 p.m. Mr Azem Hajdari, a Member of Parliament (“MP”), and his bodyguards B.C and Z.N, were shot as they came out of the Democratic Party (“DP”) headquarters in Tirana. Mr Hajdari and B.C died the same day in hospital. The second bodyguard Z.N was seriously injured.', '10.  Mr Hajdari was a leading member of the DP which was one of the two main political parties in Albania and, at the material time, in opposition. His assassination caused a rapid build-up in tension and on 13 September 1998 protesters stormed the Prime Minister’s building.', '11.  Further violence erupted in Tirana during the late MP’s funeral. A general uprising ensued, during which gunmen quickly occupied the State television headquarters, Parliament and other major buildings.', '12.  The situation in Albania was the subject of Recommendation no. 1386 (1998) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in which the Assembly strongly condemned the political violence following the murder (see paragraph 108 below).', '13.  Following the murder, a number of investigative actions were conducted.', '14.  Forensic tests were carried out at the crime scene and ballistics examinations were carried out on an automatic gun and a hand gun found at the scene. No autopsies were carried out.', '15.  In the days following the shooting the police obtained information from five witnesses. It would appear that one of the witnesses, Mrs A.R., stated that she had had a clear view of the killer and would be able to recognise him. Another witness said that he had seen two men get out of a police car (a green Mercedes Benz 250) and shoot the MP and his bodyguards. Moreover, he maintained that another man in the driver’s seat had waited in the parked car and had then got out in order to drag one of the aggressors, who had been wounded in the exchange of fire, back into the car.', '16.  On 25 September 1998 the prosecutor questioned Z.N, the wounded bodyguard who had survived the assault. He stated that he had seen an unknown person, who had left the passenger seat of a car with a police siren on its roof, firing an automatic gun without warning. There was no mention of the applicant’s name or of his involvement in the crime.', '17.  On an unspecified date Z.N left the country for Belgium.', '18.  On 15 December 1999, following the publication of a statement made by Mr Sali Berisha, who was the DP’s chairman, in which the applicant’s name was mentioned as a participant in the MP’s murder, the applicant voluntarily decided to make a statement to the prosecutor. He stated, inter alia, that on the day of the murder he had been dining alone in a restaurant, which was located close to the DP headquarters. As soon as he heard the shots, fearing for the life of his brother, the applicant left the restaurant and made some enquiries. He later returned to the restaurant and started discussing the events with A.P and H.A (see paragraph 72 below).', '19.  On an unspecified date in 2000 M., who was serving a prison sentence in Regina Celli prison in Italy, was questioned by the Albanian prosecutor’s office. On 18 February 2000 M.’s arrest in connection with the murder was ordered by the Tirana District Court (“the District Court”). In very confused statements, M. admitted to having provided the car used by the murderers.', '20.  On 26 July 2000 M. was questioned a second time and he accused three high-ranking police officers from the city of Bajram Curri of having carried out the murder, namely F.M. who used to be the Chief of Bajram Curri police commissariat, J.M who used to be the head of public order at the same police commissariat and I.H who used to be a former bodyguard of Mr Berisha. J.M and I.H have lodged separate applications with the Court (Mulosmani v. Albania, no. 29864/03 and Izet Haxhia v. Albania, no. 34783/06). M. did not accuse the applicant of involvement in the assassination.', '21.  On 16 November 2000, at the request of the Albanian prosecutor, a Bruges investigating judge questioned Z.N. In his testimony, he stated that he saw a man coming out of the back of a black Mercedes. He was wearing a bullet-proof vest over a camouflage military uniform similar to the one worn by police officers and he had a Kalashnikov machine gun in his hands, as well as two cartridge cases glued together. Contrary to the statements he had made in the days following the murder (see paragraph 16 above), he alluded to that person as J.M. He stated that he did not know the applicant.', '22.  On 20 January 2001, a recidivist offender, Ç., who was serving a prison sentence in Albania, made statements before the prosecutor. He had been observing the events that led to the MP’s assassination from the first-floor veranda of a bar, which was located close to the crime scene. He had seen the applicant in his car, a Fiat Tipo, prior to the commission of the murder. According to Ç.’s statements, F.H, J.H and N.C fired at the MP.', '23.  On 6 March 2001, following the applicant’s arrest (see paragraph 28 below), the prosecutor questioned him in the presence of his lawyer. He stated that on the night of the murder he was in a hotel near the DP headquarters. At the time of the shooting, he was having dinner in the hotel’s restaurant accompanied by other persons. His car was parked close to the hotel and the DP building. He denied having had any prior conflicts with the murdered MP.', '24.  On 10 March 2001 the prosecutor, in accordance with Article 316 § 1 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCP”), requested the District Court to obtain (të sigurojë provën) the testimony of Ç., who, notwithstanding the fact that he was serving a prison sentence in Albania, was presumed to be at risk of violence. The applicant’s lawyer requested time to prepare the defence. Accordingly, the court adjourned the hearing to 11 March 2001.', '25.  On 11 March 2001 the District Court granted the prosecutor’s request. The applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing. Witness Ç. stated that he had not received any threats, nor had any promises been made to him in exchange for his appearance at the trial. He had first made very limited statements to the prosecutor in relation to the assassination out of fear that the persons implicated in the events were police officers with previous criminal records. In his testimony, Ç. stated that it was getting dark and he was on the veranda of a bar located at the side of the DP headquarters. He saw the applicant’s car but not the applicant in person. When the MP came out of the DP headquarters, he met the applicant and both had a heated argument. He then heard a pistol shot as well as automatic gun fire. After the murder, he saw the applicant arriving in another vehicle. The applicant enquired about the murder and left the scene.', '26.  On 12 March 2001 the prosecutor disjoined the criminal proceedings against M. from the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the other co-accused.', '27.  On 31 May 2002 the prosecutor dropped the charges against M. for lack of evidence.', '28.  On 13 January 2001 the prosecutor’s office issued five arrest warrants in respect of five high-ranking police officers, including the applicant, on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of the MP, the murder of bodyguard B.C as well as the attempted murder of bodyguard Z.N.', '29.  On 22 January 2001 the applicant was arrested. He was charged with two counts of murder under Articles 79 (c) and 78 of the Criminal Code (“CC”) and one count of attempted murder under Article 78 of the CC.', '30.  On 23 January 2001 the applicant was questioned by the prosecutor. He was informed of the charges against him and of the possibility of appointing a lawyer. As a result, he requested to be represented by a counsel of his own choosing. On the same day, the prosecutor requested the validation of the applicant’s arrest.', '31.  At the hearing of 24 January 2001 the applicant was represented by his own lawyer. He stated that he had travelled to Tirana on 11 September 1998 in order to buy spare parts for his business car. On the evening of 12 September 1998 he was having dinner in a restaurant situated close to the DP headquarters. His car was parked nearby. He maintained that the prosecutor had submitted no evidence of his involvement in the assassination. As he had been working for the last two years, there was no risk of flight. The prosecutor submitted that, since the investigation was to continue for some time, the applicant would be informed of all evidence against him in due time. The District Court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant’s arrest and approved his pre-trial detention for an undefined period because there existed reasonable suspicion that the applicant had acted as an accomplice to the MP’s assassination (ekzistojnë dyshime të arsyeshme...ku i pandehuri...ka marrë pjesë në rolin e bashkëpunëtorit për kryerjen e krimit).', '32.  On 31 January 2001 the applicant lodged a direct appeal with the Supreme Court against his detention arguing that the prosecutor had not submitted sufficient and detailed evidence.', '33.  On 9 February 2001 the Supreme Court found that, since the District Court had not justified a risk of flight, the applicant’s initial detention was not lawful. However, the Supreme Court upheld his remand in custody given the circumstances sorrounding the commission of the crime, the danger that the offence posed to public order as well as the suspicion that the applicant had acted as an accomplice to the commission of the offence. It noted that the assessment of evidence was a matter for the merits of the case.', '34.  On 13 March 2001 the prosecutor lodged the bill of indictment with the District Court. A long list of supporting documents was attached to it. The applicant and the four co-accused were indicted with having participated in or organised the assassination of the MP and the attempted murder of civilians under Articles 78, 79 (c) and 25 of the CC.', '35.  On 16 March 2001 the applicant’s representative took possession of the investigation file consisting of 324 documents and 1,409 pages.', '36.   The applicant made a number of requests at the trial.', '37.  On 3 April 2001 the applicant’s lawyer requested thirty days to examine the documents collected during the criminal investigation because the prosecutor had failed to disclose any information relating to the investigation.', '38.  On 3 April 2001 the District Court, at its first hearing, granted the applicant’s request for an extension until 13 April 2001.', '39.  On 13 April 2001 the applicant objected to the admission in evidence of some audio and video cassettes and of twenty-nine witnesses’ statements, whose names did not appear on the list submitted by the prosecutor, since he had not been informed of their contents.', '40.  On 9 September 2001 he also requested that a number of expert examinations be conducted: the inspection of two cars which had allegedly been at the crime scene, a handwriting analysis of witness Ç’s signature as well as verification of the possibility of having a clear view from a well-lit venue into a dark street with regard to witness Ç.', '41.  On 17 January 2002 the trial court rejected the applicant’s requests without giving reasons.', '42.  A number of witnesses were questioned by the trial court in connection with the murder, including the following:\\n(a)  Witness K.G', '43.  K.G used to be the acting chief of the Bajram Curri police commissariat at the time of the murder. On 23 May 2001 he testified that, upon being informed of the murder, in the evening of 12 September 1998 he called a staff meeting of the heads of units in order to reinforce the security level. The applicant was not present.\\n(b)  Witness M.', '44.  Relying on Article 509 of the CCP and the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (“the Mutual Assistance Convention”), on 23 May 2001 the prosecutor requested that M. be questioned by way of a video link from Italy. The applicant opposed this request for lack of a legal basis.', '45.  On 1 June 2001 the applicant requested the exclusion of the statements made by M. during the criminal proceedings from the case file. He further requested that he be extradited from Italy so that he could be physically present at the trial. Three other witnesses were heard.', '46.  On 21 September 2001 the court accepted the prosecutor’s request to obtain M.’s testimony by way of a video link in accordance with Article 151 § 3 of the CCP. The court also admitted M.’s statements to the case file.', '47.  On 29 October 2001 the court heard M. by video link. In a statement issued on the same day the applicant and another co-accused declared their intention not to attend the hearing given the lack of any legal basis for the video link. They did not authorise their respective lawyers to represent them and they reserved the right to attend other hearings.', '48.  During the testimony M. did not state that he had seen the applicant before or after the murder.', '49.  On 3 December 2001 the applicant requested the court to dismiss M.’s testimony and statements made during the criminal investigation on grounds of technical shortcomings and contradictions in his evidence.\\n(c)  Witness A.L', '50.  A.L was a driver at the Bajram Curri police station and on 8 May 2001 he made a statement before the prosecutor. According to the statements, A.L left on a mission to Tirana late in the evening of 10 September 1998. This was at the request of J.M who was the head of public order. No details had been given to him as to the purpose of the mission. F.H and E.H accompanied him. On the way to Tirana, A.L noticed a Fiat Tipo behind them, although he could not see its driver. When they stopped at a bar to have drinks, N.C joined them. At that point, A.L saw the Fiat driving by and noticed that the applicant was driving. Upon arriving in Tirana, after taking a nap in a hotel, A.L did not see the Fiat or the applicant in the hotel’s parking lot. A.L did not mention having seen the applicant during the remainder of 11 September or at any time on 12 September. A.L returned to Bajram Curri in the evening of 12 September; no other car accompanied them. The statement was disclosed to the accused and the court on an unspecified date in 2001.', '51.  On 25 July 2001 the court heard the testimony of A.L.  The applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing and questioned A.L.', '52.  According to A.L’s testimony, on the evening of 10 September 1998 he had been ordered by J.H to prepare a police van and travel to Tirana. While leaving Bajram Curri, he saw that a Fiat Tipo, which was the applicant’s car, had joined the convoy of three cars. On the way to Tirana, a fourth person, N.C, joined them when they stopped at a bar for drinks. The applicant did not stop. Upon arrival in Tirana, they went to a hotel-bar where he saw the applicant’s car parked. After having rested for some hours in one of the hotel rooms, all of them, save for the applicant whose car was no longer in sight, decided to drive around the city. A.L did not state that he had seen the applicant on 12 September 1998.', '53.  On 26 July 2001 the applicant’s lawyer complained that the prosecutor had prevented him from preparing an adequate defence by failing to disclose A.L’s statements of 8 May 2001. The prosecutor responded that the statements had been disclosed as soon as they had been obtained. Additionally, the witness was summoned to testify before the court and questioned by the applicant’s representative. According to the prosecutor, A.L stated that he never met the applicant between 11 and 12 September, but that he had seen his car during the break on the way to Tirana and at the parking lot of the hotel-bar. He had not seen the car parked close to the Unknown Soldier’s Square on the day of the crime. The trial court rejected the applicant’s complaint.\\n(d)  Witness J.M', '54.  On 27 July 2001 J.M, who was one of the co-accused, gave evidence to the court. According to his testimony, at the request of F.H the two of them along with E.H left Bajram Curri on the evening of 10 September 1998 in a police van driven by A.L. While leaving the city, they had crossed the applicant who was driving in a separate car. When they reached Tirana, the applicant took another direction in order to take care of personal matters.', '55.  On 30 July 2001 J.M was cross-examined by all parties.\\n(e)  Witness P.G', '56.  On 20 September 2001 P.G testified. Although an eye-witness to the murders, she did not mention having seen the applicant at the crime scene.\\n(f)  Witness Ç.', '57.  On 13 June 2001 the applicant requested the court not to admit Ç.’s testimony of 11 March 2001. Since there was no legal obstacle to Ç.’s appearance at the trial and since his statements directly implicated the applicant and the other co-accused, he requested that Ç. be summoned to testify at the trial. It would appear that no decision was taken by the court.', '58.  On 9 November 2001 and 20 February 2002 the applicant unsuccessfully requested the court to take some investigative actions, including an examination of whether it would have been possible for Ç. to see into the darkness from a well-lit place at a distance of between 60 and 150 metres.', '59.  On 17 January 2002 the court dismissed the applicant’s request for an expertise on Ç’s ability to observe details of the crime scene.', '60.  On 24 January 2002 the applicant’s lawyer requested that Ç. be summoned to testify. The court rejected his request as his testimony had been secured on 11 March 2001. However, on 18 February 2002 the court revoked this decision and summoned Ç.', '61.  On 20 February 2002 Ç. testified. He stated that, at about 9 p.m. on 12 September 1998, he had been sitting on the veranda of a café bar 60 metres away from the crime scene. Notwithstanding the fact that it was completely dark outside and raining, he saw the applicant and his car with a few other persons inside. The applicant questioned the credibility of Ç.’s statements in so far as his statements involved persons and cars not described by other witnesses at the crime scene. The applicant’s request to test Ç.’s ability to see from a well-lit veranda into a dark street was again rejected by the trial court (see also paragraphs 41, 58 and 59 above), which stated that this evidence would be examined in conjunction with the remaining evidence.', '62.  On an unspecified date the owner of the café where Ç. had been sitting on the evening of 12 September 1998 was questioned. He stated that on that day the café closed, as usual, at 7 p.m. The veranda was located nearly 200 metres away from the crime scene.\\n(g)  Witness Z.N', '63.  On an unspecified date the court obtained the written submissions of Z.N, who had been seriously wounded on the day of the assassination. He made no reference to the presence of the applicant at the crime scene.\\n(h)  Witness E.B, A.P and H.A', '64.  On 24 December 2001 witnesses E.B, A.P, H.A testified that, at the time of the shooting, they were having dinner with the applicant in a restaurant near the crime scene.\\n(i)  The applicant’s testimony', '65.  On 5 March 2002 the applicant made detailed written submissions about his movements on 11 and 12 September 1998. He stated that, at the request of his superior, he had left Bajram Curri early on the morning of 11 September 2001 by himself. Contrary to A.L’s statements, he did not know that J.M had left for Tirana on the same day. He denied having been at the hotel on the morning of 11 September as stated by A.L.', '66.  On 8 March 2002 the applicant testified. He stated that on 10 September 1998 he was given oral instructions to go on a mission to Tirana. However, no written order or authorisation was made. He left Bajram Curri at 2 a.m. on 11 September 1998, driving alone in his car. Had he known that J.M and three other people were driving in another vehicle, he would have joined them, given the volatile security situation in the region at the time. He had never been in the hotel-bar as alleged by A.L. As to his presence at N.C’s funeral, he was simply accompanying F.H and E.H at F.H’s request.', '67.  On 18 March 2002 the court requested the parties’ final submissions. On the same day the prosecutor made his final submissions in favour of the applicant’s conviction as charged.', '68.  On 10 April 2002 the applicant made his final submissions.', '69.  On 29 April 2002 the District Court gave judgment. It found that the applicant had aided and abetted the perpetrators by escorting them on the night of 10 September 1998 in his police car. His car had been parked on the evening of 12 September close to the crime scene and he had been spotted at the crime scene after the commission of the crime. While he was aware that F.H was sought by the police, he continued to maintain contacts with F.H and his brother and was subsequently seen at N.C’s funeral. His involvement in the run-up to the crime was proved by witnesses A.L, K.G and J.M and the applicant’s witnesses did not cast any doubt on those conclusions. The decision, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\\n“Another person who participated in the commission of the criminal offence is the accused Ismet Haxhia.\\nA number of actions, which set off... with escorting the team from Bajram Curri to Tirana and, further on, to Hotel Murati where the team was put up in the afternoon of 11 September 1998, his presence at the crime scene ... together with his Fiat Tipo car ..., as well as his presence at the N.C’s family, 40 days after his death, create the conviction for the court that he acted as an accomplice, an abettor, in the commission of the crime.\\nThe above is proved by the evidence of witness A.L who was present at those events, the evidence of K.G who stated that Ismet Haxhia ... had not taken leave to go to Tirana on 11 and 12 September.\\nHis presence at the above events is also proved by the testimony of co-accused J.M.\\nThe totality of these actions, as elements of actus reus of the criminal offence, lead the court to conclude that the accused Ismet Haxhia is an accomplice, an abettor, to the commission of the crime.\\nThe witnesses called by the accused did not overturn or question his presence at those events which concerned the preparation, commission and post-event developments.”', '70.  The court also held that the MP had not been assassinated on political grounds, but for revenge-related purposes (hakmarrje) on account of his perceived involvement in the murder of F.H’s brother. Consequently, the court reclassified the charges against the applicant as premeditated murder committed on grounds of revenge under Article 78 § 2 of the CC, which had entered into force on 24 January 2001. The decision, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\\n“The prosecutor’s office reclassified the murder under Article 79 (c) connecting it to the fact that, during a parliamentary session, the murdered MP had accused F.H of killing [a police officer].\\nOn that basis, [the prosecutor] determined that the motive for the MP’s murder had been his position as an MP. However, the evidence obtained at trial, the circumstances and the events leading up to the MP’s assassination proved that revenge had been an aggravating factor in the commission of the murder (vërtetojnë se vrasja është kryer për motivet ë dobëta të hakmarrjes).', '71.  In passing judgment on two co-accused, the court rejected the testimonies of witnesses Ç. and M. as contradictory and unreliable. The court also found J.M guilty as charged.', '72.  The District Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting the MP’s murder under Articles 78 § 2 and 25 of the CC and acquitted him of the charges in connection with the murder of B.C and the attempted murder of Z.N. The applicant was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment. The decision, in so far as relevant, states as follows:\\n“As outlined by the prosecutor, in the present case there exists simple collaboration and not a scheme of [defined] roles, duties, objectives and plans. In this collaboration, the aider and abettor ... Ismet Haxhia contributed by different means but always for the sole purpose of killing Azem Hajdari.\\nUnless proved that there existed a detailed plan between the co-defendants and other people who are no longer alive or that there existed an oral agreement whereby everyone’s role was defined for the accomplishment of the final goal... the accused Ismet Haxhia cannot and should not be held liable for the excesses of the perpetrator. Ismet Haxhia, not being linked to [the existence of a] defined scheme and not being the perpetrator of the premeditated murder, should be held responsible only for [aiding and abetting] the premeditated murder of Azem Hajdari.”', '73.  On 29 October 2001 at 10 a.m. the applicant and another co-accused alleged before the Tirana Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”) that the bench of the District Court was partial. They considered that this was demonstrated by the rejection of all of their motions and by the admission of unlawfully obtained evidence such as M.’s testimony (see paragraph 47 above).', '74.  On the same day, in the absence of the applicant and his representative but in the presence of the prosecutor, the Court of Appeal dismissed the request on the ground that it concerned the assessment of evidence which would be examined during any appeal lodged against conviction.', '75.  On 9 November 2001 the applicant appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court. The appeal document submitted is dated 13 November 2001 and it bears the trial court’s stamp on the top right-hand corner.', '76.  On 14 January 2002 the applicant enquired about his appeal to the Supreme Court. The District Court responded that the Supreme Court had made no request for the transfer of the case file for examination.', '77.  The appeal was never examined by the Supreme Court, but was addressed in its decision of 14 February 2003 (see paragraph 87 below).', '78.  On 7 May 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal against the District Court’s judgment. He maintained that the prosecutor had lodged the bill of indictment and transferred the criminal file to the trial court without having disclosed any documents. The trial court had not granted him sufficient time to examine the documents on which the prosecutor based the charges. The lack of prompt disclosure of A.L’s statements of 8 May 2001 prevented him from preparing an adequate defence; in his testimony A.L had merely stated that on the way to Tirana he had seen the applicant’s car overtake him. He further contested the manner in which M.’s testimony had been obtained as well as M.’s absence from the hearing.\\nThe applicant further complained that the Court of Appeal’s decision of 29 October 2001 was taken in his absence and in breach of the principle of adversarial proceedings (see paragraph 74 above). His appeal against that decision was still pending before the Supreme Court. According to the applicant, the trial court did not give sufficient weight to witnesses’ testimonies that indicated that he was having dinner at a nearby restaurant when the MP was murdered (see paragraph 64 above). Nor had eye-witnesses P.G, Z.N and S.L declared that they had seen him at the crime scene or that they had seen a police car parked nearby. Contrary to the trial court’s interpretation of his actions, there was no discernible criminal element in the fact that, two days prior to the murder, he had travelled with the people who later assassinated the MP; nor in the fact that he participated in N.C’s funeral forty days after the murder; nor in the fact that he had known F.H’s brother fifteen years previously. The trial court’s decision lacked reasons as regards his role as an abettor (ndihmës) as provided for by Article 26 of the CC.', '79.  At the hearing of 8 July 2002 the applicant submitted a comprehensive memorial and made a detailed list of requests for the Court of Appeal to consider namely, the admission of evidence, the conduct of further investigative actions and the questioning of additional witnesses.', '80.  On 9 July 2002 the Court of Appeal admitted in evidence a number of the documents requested by the applicant and rejected the remainder of his requests. On the same date, it upheld the District Court’s judgment as a whole. Most notably, the Court of Appeal held that the applicant had participated in the commission of the crime as an abettor. For example, he had escorted the perpetrators from Bajram Curri to Tirana and back, he had been seen at the hotel, his car was parked close to the crime scene, he was a close friend of H.H who was the brother of F.H and he had been seen paying a visit to N.C’s family 40 days after his death. His role was based on the testimonies of the co-accused J.M, witnesses A.L and L.G as well as of other witnesses. The applicant’s witnesses did not call into question his presence during the above-listed events.', '81.  The Court of Appeal also upheld J.M’s conviction.', '82.  On 31 July 2002 J.M, one of the co-accused, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing, inter alia, that the lower courts were not empowered to reclassify the criminal charges against him.', '83.  On 5 August 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court relying on the same grounds of appeal as before the Court of Appeal, adding that the Court of Appeal’s decision was not adequately reasoned. His conviction was based on circumstantial evidence instead of evidence of concrete unlawful actions committed by himself.', '84.  On 14 February 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments.', '85.  The Supreme Court found that, notwithstanding the fact that in the case file there had been no formal decision to close the investigation stage and disclose the documents obtained during the criminal investigation to the applicant and the other co-accused, on 3 April 2001 the District Court had accepted the applicant’s request for additional time and granted him sufficient time for the preparation of his defence.', '86.  The Supreme Court found that the statements and video testimony of M. had been obtained on the basis of Articles 151 § 3 and 509 of the CCP as well as of the Mutual Assistance Convention. M.’s statements during the criminal investigation had been subjected to judicial examination by way of a video link. The fact that the applicant had left the hearing did not render the production of evidence unlawful, having regard to the presence of other co-accused and their lawyers who had exercised the right to cross-examine M. While the Supreme Court condemned the applicant’s behaviour at the hearing, it called on the trial court to ensure that, in future, court-appointed lawyers should be made available in order to guarantee the protection of the rights of the defence.', '87.  The Supreme Court noted that the case file contained a copy of the applicant’s appeal of 9 November 2001 (see paragraph 75 above), but it ruled that the appeal had not been lodged in accordance with the legal requirements (there was no note of the court’s registry about its date of introduction).', '88.  The fact that the applicant and the co-accused had not been previously provided with a copy of witness A.L’s statement did not infringe their defence rights: A.L had testified at trial at the applicant’s request and the applicant had had an opportunity to question him.', '89.  In response to the complaint raised by co-accused J.M, the Supreme Court further found that the reclassification of the charges against the applicant by the trial court was in compliance with the law namely, Article 375 of the CCP which had entered into force on 13 June 2002.', '90.  The Supreme Court noted that, whereas the applicant had the right to request a reopening of the judicial examination, it was at the court’s discretion to obtain additional evidence. In his case, the Court of Appeal had admitted in evidence a number of documents and had dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s motions on the grounds that they were unnecessary for the examination of the case.', '91.  Finally, the Supreme Court rejected the remainder of the applicant’s complaints on the ground that they concerned the assessment of evidence, which was the lower courts’ function.', '92.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the Constitutional Court. He submitted that his initial detention had not been based on the existence of a reasonable suspicion and that he had not been promptly informed of the reasons for that detention. He further alleged that he had not had sufficient time to study the voluminous information in the criminal investigation file submitted to the trial court. In his view, certain pieces of evidence had been obtained unlawfully: M.’s testimony had not been obtained through the Ministry of Justice as required under Article 509 of the CCP, since the Mutual Assistance Convention had entered into force on a later date in respect of Albania; M.’s testimony was obtained in the applicant’s absence; Ç’s testimony was secured with too much haste, on a Sunday, without the applicant having been fully informed of the reasons; and J.M’s and A.L’s statements of 6 and 8 May 2001, respectively, were obtained after the conclusion of the criminal investigation in breach of the domestic law (Article 324 § 4 of the CCP).', '93.  The applicant contended that all his requests to have expert reports prepared or to summon witnesses had been unreasonably rejected by the trial court. The Court of Appeal had also failed to give reasons for the refusal to obtain certain evidence he had requested. The applicant complained about the lack of impartiality of the domestic courts, particularly having regard to the Court of Appeal’s decision of 29 October 2001 which was taken in an accelerated procedure, in the absence of himself and his representative and within two hours. The failure of the Supreme Court to examine his appeal gave rise to a breach of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention. His conviction was not reasoned and was based on circumstantial evidence (travelling to Tirana together with the authors of the crime, dining 200 metres away from the crime scene on the day of the crime, attending N.C’s funeral forty days after the crime and his friendship with the perpetrator’s brother (H.H) ten years before the crime).', '94.  J.M also appealed to the Constitutional Court arguing, inter alia, that the lower courts had exceeded their powers when they reclassified the criminal charges against him.', '95.  On 9 July 2003 the Constitutional Court, sitting as a full formation of nine judges, declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the appeal did not disclose a breach of the right to a fair trial.

He worked as the secretary of the Chişinău Municipal Council.', '7.  On 8 October 2004 the Prosecutor General initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for alleged abuse of power under Article 327 § 2 of the Criminal Code, in relation to a purchase of 40 ambulances by the Chişinău Mayoralty.', '8.  On 12 November 2004 the applicant was arrested by officer G.G. from the Centre for Fighting Economic Crime and Corruption (CFECC). On 15 November 2004 the Buiucani District Court issued a warrant for his remand in custody for 10 days. The reasons given by the court for issuing the warrant were that:\\n“The criminal file was opened in accordance with the law in force. [The applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence for which the law provides imprisonment for more than two years; the evidence submitted to the court was obtained lawfully; the isolation of the suspect from society is necessary; he could abscond from law enforcement authorities or the court; he could obstruct the finding of truth in the criminal investigation or re-offend”.', '9.  On 18 November 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal partly quashed that decision and adopted a new one, ordering the applicant’s house arrest. The court found that:\\n“The [lower] court did not commit any procedural mistakes, but taking into account that [the applicant] has a permanent place of residence, has no criminal record, is ill and requires treatment in conditions of non-isolation from society and that there is no specific information about the probability of his absconding from the law-enforcement authorities, the [court] considers that in the present case the normal flow of the criminal investigation will be ensured if the accused is subjected to the preventive measure of house arrest. The [court] also notes that the criminal file was opened on 8 October 2004 and that on 13 and 16 November 2004 the applicant was summonsed by the [law-enforcement authorities] as a witness, but on 12 November 2004 he was taken into custody, and no newly discovered circumstances requiring his detention were submitted. Besides, it is necessary to take into account the presumption of innocence, guaranteed by Article 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the offence with which the applicant is charged is also punishable with a fine.”', '10.  On 19 November 2004 the applicant was again arrested on suspicion of having committed the offence of exceeding the limits of his powers in exercising a public function, contrary to Article 328 § 1 of the Criminal Code, in relation to the same purchase of ambulances referred to in paragraph 7 above. The reason given for the arrest was that “eye witnesses can testify that this person has committed a crime”.', '11.  On 22 November 2004 the President of the Buiucani District Court issued a warrant for his detention for 10 days. The reasons given by the court for issuing the warrant were that:\\n“[the applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence, for which the law provides imprisonment for more than two years; the evidence submitted to the court was obtained lawfully; the isolation of the suspect from society is necessary; he could abscond from law enforcement authorities or the court; he could obstruct the finding of the truth in the criminal investigation or re-offend”.', '12.  The applicant submitted arguments against the necessity of applying the preventive measure of detention and focused on his bad state of health. He referred to concrete facts, such as that since his first arrest he had never obstructed in any way the investigation and had appeared before the authorities whenever summonsed. His conduct regarding the investigation had always been irreproachable. He had a family, had property in Moldova and none abroad, and several newspapers were ready to guarantee his freedom in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The applicant was ready to give up his passport as an assurance that he would not leave the country.', '13.  On 25 November 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Buiucani District Court of 22 November 2004. The court gave no specific reasons for its decision other than to confirm the lawfulness of the lower court’s decision.', '14.  On 26 November 2004 the President of the Buiucani District Court prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand for another 30 days until 29 December 2004. The court reasoned that detention was necessary because:\\n“[the applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence; there is a risk that he may put pressure on witnesses or put himself out of the reach of law enforcement authorities; and there is a continuing need to isolate him from society”.', '15.  On 2 December 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal without relying on any new arguments.', '16.  On 14 December 2004 the President of the Buiucani District Court rejected a habeas corpus request made by the applicant, stating that:\\n“according to the criminal file, [the applicant] is accused of having committed a less serious offence, for which the law provides the punishment of deprivation of liberty for more than two years.”', '17.  On 20 December 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 14 December 2004.', '18.  Also on 20 December 2004 officer G.G., the investigator who had arrested the applicant and who had been in charge of the case since 10 September 2004, made a declaration during a press conference. He essentially stated that the case against the Mr Urecheanu and other accused in the “ambulances case” was fabricated for political reasons in order to remove political opponents. There was nothing in the file, according to G.G., which would warrant the initiation of the criminal proceedings or the arrest of the applicant.', '19.  On 21 December 2004 the investigation ended and the criminal file was referred to the Centru District Court. According to the domestic law, no prolongation of detention on remand was necessary after that and the applicant remained in custody pending a final judgment favourable to him or a court decision to end his detention.', '20.  On 13 January 2005, during the first hearing on the merits of the criminal case, the applicant submitted another habeas corpus request and expressed his readiness to present further guarantees against absconding. He based his request, inter alia, on his weak state of health and on the declarations made by the investigator G.G. on 20 December 2004. At the prosecutor’s request, the court postponed the hearing until 20 January 2005 in order to decide on joining the applicant’s case with that of other suspects.', '21.  On 20 January 2005 the court accepted a prosecutor’s request to join the applicant’s case with three other criminal cases of persons who worked in the Chişinău Mayoralty. In reply to the applicant’s habeas corpus request, the court held that it would be for the court examining the joined cases to decide whether the continuing detention was necessary. He complained about the court’s failure to properly respond to his request.', '22.  On 27 January 2005 the hearing was postponed.', '23.  On 2 February 2005 the court rejected, by a final judgment, the applicant’s habeas corpus request, finding that:\\n“[the applicant was remanded] because he is suspected of having committed a serious offence; he may abscond from the law enforcement authorities; and he may obstruct the finding of truth in the criminal process. The grounds on which the detention on remand was ordered remain valid.”', '24.  On 16 February 2005 the Centru District Court rejected another habeas corpus request made by the applicant, finding that “the grounds for detaining the applicant on remand still hold”.', '25.  The applicant has a medical condition called “progressive cervical osteoarthritis[1] (mielopatie) with displacement of vertebrae C5-C6-C7, with pain disorder” and has to wear permanently a device immobilizing his neck to minimize risk of fatal injuries to his spinal cord. He also suffers from gout and from arterial hypertension of second degree with increased risk of cardio-vascular complications, all confirmed by medical certificates.', '26.  His complaint about the lack of sufficient medical assistance refers to the period of his detention in the CFECC remand centre between 12 November 2004 and 18 January 2005.', '27.  Between 12 and 29 November 2004 (between 19 and 29 November according to the Government) the applicant held a hunger strike. On 19 November 2004 (the day of his second arrest) he was consulted by Doctor A. E., who noted the applicant’s complaints about pain in his back and diagnosed him with serious arterial hypertension (hipertensiune arterială esenţială), giving him medication to decrease his blood pressure.', '28.  According to the applicant, neither his family doctor, doctor G., nor any other doctor had been allowed to examine him while in detention until after communication of his application to the Government. He submitted copies of two requests lodged by his family doctor on 22 and 29 November 2004 by which he asked permission to examine the applicant or to have him examined by any other qualified doctor. Neither of the requests was allowed or even acknowledged.', '29.  According to the Government, the applicant did not personally make any request to see doctor G. at any time during his detention.', '30.  On 29 November 2004 the applicant fainted during a court hearing and was rushed to a detainee hospital, where he was treated until 20 December 2004.', '31.  According to the applicant, he was not examined by any neurologist while in the hospital. His personal medical file shows that he complained on numerous occasions of pain in the cervical region of his spine and numbness in his fingers and arms (on 2, 7, 13 and 15 December 2004). Only on 15 December 2004 was he visited by a neurologist who concluded that: “an examination by a neurosurgeon is recommended in order to determine the appropriate treatment”. No such further examination took place.', '32.  On 20 December 2004 he was released from hospital and taken back to the remand centre. According to his release form, he was “in a satisfactory condition with the recommendation of supervision by a general practitioner and a neurologist, checks of arterial blood pressure and administration of tablets....”', '33.  On 20 December 2004 a prosecutor allowed a request by the applicant’s wife to have the applicant examined by a neurologist at the remand centre. However, the doctor did not have access to the applicant due to the CFECC administration’s refusal to allow that.', '34.  According to the applicant there were no medical personnel in the remand centre.', '35.  According to the Government, there was a doctor, R.V., who was a general practitioner and who had provided regular medical assistance to the applicant throughout his detention. In case of an emergency, detainees could have been transported to a nearby hospital.', '36.  According to the applicant, due to the lack of medical assistance, he had had to use the opportunity to have his blood pressure measured through the bars of the cage in which he was held during court hearings.', '37.  The Government did not dispute that, but rather stated that the general practitioner at the remand centre had provided the applicant with medical assistance whenever he requested it.', '38.  According to the Medical Register of the remand centre, submitted by the Government, during the period with which the complaint is concerned the applicant was examined only on 19 November 2004. The next record regarding the applicant is on 19 January 2005. Doctor R.V.’s name appears for the first time, in all the documents submitted by the Government, on 11 February 2005.', '39.  The applicant’s wife made numerous unsuccessful attempts (on 16, 17, 20, 22, 26, 27 November 2004, as well as on 20 and 21 December 2004) to obtain permission to check on his state of health and to bring him various items. Both the applicant and his wife requested that an arterial blood monitor should be brought and, that instructions should be sought from doctor G. on how properly to use it. She was eventually allowed to give the items to the applicant.', '40.  On 19 January 2005 the Centru District Court allowed the applicant’s request to be examined by a doctor. On the same day he was examined by the Head of the Therapy Section of the Pruncul Hospital, who noted in the Medical Register (see paragraph 38 above) that the applicant did not complain about his health.', '41.  Doctor G., who examined the applicant on 26 January 2005, concluded that his condition had substantially worsened due to the combination of the three diseases (see paragraph 25 above). In the event of lack of medical treatment, the applicant ran serious risks for his life and health. Failure permanently and correctly to monitor and react to changes in his arterial pressure, level of uric acid and other signs could lead to serious effects including myocardium infarct and cerebral-vascular accidents and even sudden death.', '42.  Professor Z., the Head of the Neurology Chair of the “Nicolae Testimiteanu” hospital, was allowed to see the applicant in prison on 25 January 2005. The applicant complained of pain and numbness in his hands, of headaches and of the lack of constant supervision by a specialized doctor. In his report, professor Z. referred only to the applicant’s cervical osteoarthritis and did not recommend hospitalisation. He recommended treatment with symptomatic medication, limitation of physical movement and the permanent wearing of the neck-fixing device. While he found no major risk to the patient’s life due to osteoarthritis, he admitted that there was a constant risk of worsening of the condition of his nervous system. He considered that in case of aggravation of the applicant’s state of health, he would need neurosurgical treatment in a specialised clinic.', '43.  Two other doctors, doctor S.G. and doctor M.G., who examined the applicant’s medical files in late January 2005, while referring to the applicant’s cervical osteoarthritis, submitted that this disease could ultimately lead to permanent loss of movement and to negative effects for the cardio-vascular system. Doctor S.G. recommended medication, special gymnastics and consultation by a neurosurgeon in order to determine the necessity of undergoing micro-neurosurgery. He also recommended the wearing of a neck immobilisation device. Doctor M.G. submitted that there was a serious risk for the applicant’s health linked to his osteoarthritis, including tetraparesis[2]. He recommended hospitalisation.', '44.  A State Medical Commission created after the communication of the case to the Government found that cervical osteoarthritis presented a risk to the applicant’s health and that there was a possibility of an eventual increase in the pain suffered. The patient needed “a regime of adequate medical supervision and treatment on an out-patient basis (at home, at work, in prison)”. In a letter of 9 February 2005 to the Government Agent the Ministry of Health declared that high arterial blood pressure and gout required “an adequate psycho-emotional regime and the administration of medication prescribed by a doctor”.', '45.  According to the applicant, except for one occasion, he was always brought to the court in handcuffs and placed in a metal cage during the hearings. The Government did not dispute that.', '46.  According to the applicant the cell in which he was detained in the remand centre was overcrowded since it had 11 m2 for 4 persons and was too hot.', '47.  According to the Government the applicant had been detained with only one more person in the cell and the temperature and other conditions were within acceptable limits. In support of their submissions the Government sent the Court a copy of a report of 11 February 2005, drafted by a sanitary-epidemiological inspection and pictures and a video showing the applicant’s cell.', '48.  The room for meetings between lawyers and detainees in the remand centre had a double glass partition with holes which only partly coincided and which were covered with a thick net, to keep them separated. According to the applicant they had to shout in order to hear each other and could not exchange documents for signature.', '49.  The Government did not dispute the existence of a glass partition and sent the Court a video with its images.', '50.  On 15 February 2005 the applicant requested the Centru District Court to order the CFECC administration to provide a room for confidential meetings with his lawyer. On 16 February 2005 the court rejected the request on the ground that according to the CFECC administration, there were no recording devices installed in the meeting room and that the glass partition was necessary for the security of detainees and lawyers.'], 'applicants': ['SARBAN'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '8'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['27', '28', '29', '31', '33', '36', '37', '38', '41', '45', '46', '47', '71', '9'], '5': ['102', '117', '14', '18', '19', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '84', '85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91']}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 8, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3, 8, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41], 'explained_indices': [22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 23, 43, 44, 20, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 21, 11, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 12, 2, 3, 1, 0], 'explained_distances': [0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.18018779, 0.03781596, -0.039913416, -0.09091288, -0.15611964], 'number_of_sentences': 45, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

Mustafa Tunç was born in 1946 and died in 2006. Fecire and Yüksel Tunç, born in 1952 and 1975 respectively, live in Istanbul. They are the father, mother and brother of Cihan Tunç, who was born on 20 November 1983 and died on 13 February 2004.', '12.  Cihan Tunç joined the army in August 2003 to perform his compulsory military service. The medical report drawn up prior to his conscription stated that there were no contraindications to his conscription. He was not known to suffer from any psychological disorder or any other specific problem.', '13.  On an unspecified date Cihan Tunç obtained the rank of corporal. Following a training exercise which ended on 31 November 2003, he qualified as a sergeant.', '14.  He was then assigned to the protection of a site belonging to the private oil company NV Turkse Perenco (“Perenco”), for which the Kocaköy central gendarmerie was providing security services.', '15.  On 13 February 2004, at about 5.50 a.m., he was injured by gunfire. He was one of the gendarmes on sentry duty and assigned to the guard post known as “tower no. 3”. The incident occurred at the guard post known as “tower no. 2”.', '16.  Cihan Tunç was transported to hospital immediately after the incident by sergeant A.A. and private M.D., accompanied by private M.S., who was the last person to have seen Cihan Tunç before the incident.', '17.  Cihan Tunç was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Diyarbakır Military Hospital.', '18.  The military prosecutor’s office of the 7th Army Corps, located in Diyarbakır, was informed immediately after the incident and a judicial investigation was opened as a matter of course.', '19.  A few hours after the incident, a member of that office, military prosecutor E.Ö., went to the hospital to which Cihan Tunç had been admitted and was joined there, on his instructions, by a team of criminal investigation experts from the national gendarmerie. In addition, he sent another team to the scene of the incident and asked the Kocaköy (civilian) prosecutor to attend, in order to supervise the initial investigations and take any measures necessary to secure evidence.', '20.  On his arrival at the hospital, the military prosecutor ordered that an external examination of the corpse and an autopsy be carried out, under his supervision.', '21.  Several photos were taken of the corpse. The deceased’s clothing was removed and sent for laboratory analysis with a view to determining the distance from which the shot had been fired. Fingerprints were taken from the deceased and from M.S., who was the last person to have seen Cihan Tunç alive and could therefore have been involved in the incident. Swabs were also taken from their hands, to be checked for traces of gunpowder. Lastly, the deceased’s pockets were emptied and an inventory made of their contents.', '22.  The prosecutor then instructed forensic doctor L.E. to examine the body with a view to ascertaining the cause of death, and to make any observations he may have on the circumstances of the death.', '23.  The forensic doctor recorded the following findings: body height, 1.75 metres; the entry wound, with an abrasion ring, was on the right side of the neck, and the exit wound, measuring 4 x 2 centimetres, was on the left side of the back, under the lower edge of the shoulder blade. The forensic doctor noted no trace on the body of blows or violence. He stated that death had occurred following a haemorrhage caused by a bullet wound, and that the bullet had struck the trachea and left lung. He also mentioned that the shot had probably been fired at point-blank range (yakın atış). He based that conclusion on the presence of certain residue material. The relevant part of his report on this point reads as follows:\\n“No skin coloration due to a burn or smoke was observed on the right side of the face or on the neck area. Traces of gunpowder were noted only on the right side of the face, on the curve of the lower jaw.”', '24.  All of those observations were recorded in a document entitled “Record of the post-mortem examination and autopsy”.', '25.  The military prosecutor also questioned private M.S. and sergeant A.A. (see paragraphs 37-45 and 46-50 below), who had arrived at the hospital in the vehicle transporting Cihan Tunç’s body.', '26.  Simultaneously, a team of experts from the Diyarbakır national gendarmerie’s criminal investigation laboratory and the Kocaköy civilian prosecutor went to the site a few hours after the events, having received instructions to that effect from the military prosecutor in charge of the case.', '27.  According to the Kocaköy prosecutor’s report, the site had a total of six guard posts: a watchtower, known as the “high tower” and five sentry posts. The incident had taken place in an edifice measuring 2 x 2 metres, with a ceiling height of 2.33m and apertures placed 1.5m from the ground.', '28.  The report further noted that two unspent cartridges and a spent cartridge were found lying on the ground inside the sentry post. The ceiling had an impact mark which resembled that of a shot. Small pieces of cement debris from the ceiling were found on the floor, which was also spattered with large bloodstains.', '29.  The report also stated that a cursory examination of the deceased’s weapon, a G-3-type rifle which had been placed under lock and key pending the prosecutor’s arrival, indicated that it had been used a short time previously. According to the report, this weapon, as well as that assigned to private M.S., an MG-3-type rifle which seemed not to have been used, had been sent to a laboratory for scientific analysis.', '30.  Lastly, the report specified that a detailed record had been drawn up, two sketches drawn, photographs taken and a video recording made.', '31.  In accordance with usual practice, an administrative inquiry was carried out on the orders of the provincial gendarmerie commander, to shed light on the incident and draw any conclusions from it, with a view to ensuring that a similar incident did not occur again.', '32.  On an unspecified date the deceased’s body, escorted by Staff Sergeant V.Ç., was transported to Ankara, for transfer to Istanbul and release to the family. The Istanbul provincial gendarmerie directorate was asked to contact the family to make arrangements for the funeral.', '33.  On 16 February 2004 the gendarmerie’s criminal research laboratory issued an expert report (report no. 2004/90/chemical). That report indicated that analysis of the samples taken from the deceased’s hands and from M.S., using the so-called “atomic absorption spectrometry” technique, had revealed the presence of lead, barium and antimony on the deceased’s hands, and of barium and antimony on those of M.S. After noting that those elements were residues from the discharging of a weapon, the report pointed out that gunpowder residues contained micrometric particles which passed very easily from one surface to another and that those residues frequently migrated to the hands when first aid was administered.', '34.  The report also noted that the tests on Cihan Tunç’s clothes indicated that he had been the victim of a shot fired at point-blank range.', '35.  On 17 February 2004 the Diyarbakır national police criminal laboratory also issued its expert report (report no. BLS-2004/464), following ballistic tests carried out on the spent cartridge and on the two weapons found at the scene of the incident. The tests indicated that the two rifles were operating normally and confirmed that the spent cartridge came from Cihan Tunç’s weapon.', '36.  As part of the investigations carried out by the military prosecutor’s office and the gendarmerie’s internal inquiry, numerous servicemen were questioned on the day of the incident.', '37.  In his evidence to the military prosecutor, M.S. stated:\\n“Cihan arrived at the tower where I was on duty fifteen to twenty minutes before he was due to relive me, since that was where the handover was to take place... He told me that he was feeling down. When I asked him why, he answered ‘Forget it, mind your own business, you wouldn’t understand in any case’. His reply annoyed me, I had the impression he thought I was an idiot. I lit a cigarette and [Cihan] went into the tower ... he began playing with the cocking lever on his rifle. I came in and told him to stop ... He told me to mind my own business and go and have a cigarette ... At that point I went out ... I was five or six metres from the tower when I heard a shot. I ran inside. [Cihan] was lying on the ground ... his rifle was lying on his right hand and the barrel was on his shoulder. I removed the rifle and tried to revive [Cihan] by shaking him, blood had begun to flow... Sergeant A.A. arrived [with other soldiers]”.', '38.  In response to the prosecutor’s questions, M.S. replied that he had not had a dispute or a problem with Cihan Tunç, either during the duty shift or before it. He confirmed that he had not tried to remove the weapon from his hands at any point. He stated that he had not shot his fellow serviceman.', '39.  In reply to another question, he stated that, when Cihan Tunç loaded and then unloaded the weapon several times, he had seen unspent cartridges being ejected from the side of the rifle.', '40.  In the course of his interview with the gendarmerie’s internal investigator, he stated:\\n“Sergeant A.A. came past about 5 a.m., during his patrol, to carry out a check. Cihan Tunç arrived shortly afterwards, at about 5.50 a.m. ... he came into the tower sentry post and began to play with his weapon, he loaded and then unloaded it three or four times, and removed the magazine and put it back in. I asked him to stop, and said that we would both be punished if a senior officer were to come in unannounced... He stopped for a moment. I was standing seven or eight metres away from him. Then, [when] outside the post, I heard the noise of the cocking lever two or three times, followed by the sound of the weapon going off ... [Cihan] was lying on the ground, the weapon was on his chest. I tried to revive him. At that point, sergeant A.A. and the soldiers who were due to relieve us arrived. We carried Cihan close to the [oil] container, then we took him to Diyarbakır Hospital in a Renault car belonging to the Perenco company...”', '41.  To the question “how do you explain the fact that two unspent cartridges were found at the scene of the incident?” M.S. replied that he did not have an explanation. He added that perhaps these were cartridges which had fallen when Cihan Tunç was loading and unloading the weapon.', '42.  In response to another question, he said that he was unable to state if the magazine had been in the weapon at the time of the incident, since he had paid no attention to that point.', '43.  The investigator also asked M.S. about the positions of the weapon and Cihan Tunç. More specifically, he asked if the latter had been sitting or standing while he was manipulating his rifle. M.S. indicated that, while he was inside the post with Cihan Tunç, the latter had pointed the weapon towards the ceiling and charged it, and had then removed the magazine and operated the lever to eject the loaded cartridge. As he left the post, he saw Cihan Tunç sit down on an ammunition chest. While still outside, he heard the sound of the cocking lever a further two times, then a shot.', '44.  Lastly, the investigator questioned M.S. about the location of the weapons. According to M.S., his own rifle had been on a rack inside the post, and its tripod was folded. Cihan’s weapon had been on his chest.', '45.  In those two statements, the location where the incident took place is described interchangeably by the terms “duty station no. 4” (4 no.lu nöbet mevzisi) or “tower no. 2” (2 no.lu kule).', '46.  In his statement to the military prosecutor, sergeant A.A. indicated that he had heard a gunshot and, together with several privates, had rushed to the spot from where the sound had come. They found Cihan Tunç lying on the ground. After attempting to find the injured man’s pulse, A.A. ordered that he be transported to the canteen and then to hospital.', '47.  With regard to the guard posts, sergeant A.A. indicated that only three were in use. The first was situated at the entrance to the site (nizamiye); the second post, known as the “low tower”, although in reality located in fourth position from the entrance, was also known as “tower no. 2”, since the two preceding posts were not used. The third post was known as “tower no. 3” or the “high tower”.', '48.  A.A. also stated that, to his knowledge, there had been no problem between Cihan Tunç and M.S.', '49.  In reply to a question from the prosecutor, he repeated the account of the events given to him by M.S. This account corresponded to the statement made by M.S.', '50.  A.A. gave similar evidence to the gendarmerie’s internal investigator.', '51.  Captain S.D. and Staff Sergeant C.Y. indicated that they had become aware of the incident while they were in the Kocaköy barracks. On arrival at the scene, they inspected the premises in a very cursory manner, without disturbing the scene of the incident. They had seen a spent cartridge and two cartridges for a G-3 rifle, one on the ground and the other on the rack. They had also noted blood on the ground.', '52.  Sergeant A.K. gave the following evidence to the investigator:\\n“Cihan was on duty at post no. 2 ... During my round, at about 5.15 a.m.... everything was normal. I exchanged a few words with Cihan, who was on duty in the high tower... When I arrived at the scene of the incident, M.S. was trying to lift Cihan up.”', '53.  With regard to the position of the magazine, sergeant A.K. stated that he had paid no attention to that point at the time. However, he remembered that, after carrying Cihan to the canteen, private S.K. had gone back and brought him the weapon, and he had noticed that the magazine was not in place on the rifle.', '54.  To the question “why did the incident take place at guard post no. 4, where M.S. was on duty, although Cihan Tunç had been assigned to the high tower?” he replied:\\n“I don’t know. It is possible that Cihan left his post to go there because he was almost at the end of his duty period. When I did my round, at about 5.15 a.m., Cihan was at his post in the high tower.”', '55.  Private S.K. confirmed A.K.’s statement, indicating that the weapon and the magazine were inside the sentry post, but that the magazine was not in the weapon.', '56.  Private E.C. stated that when he arrived on the scene M.S. was attempting to lift Cihan Tunç up. He also confirmed that the magazine was not in the weapon.', '57.  The following additional elements emerged from the other statements: Cihan Tunç had arrived one week previously in the Perenco site protection team, which was composed of sixteen persons. He had no known problems and had not had a dispute with the other soldiers.\\nAt the time of the incident, private S.S. had been the soldier on sentry duty at the first guard post, located at the entrance to the site.\\nAfter sergeant A.A. and the other servicemen arrived at the scene of the incident, M.S. was sent to the canteen to seek help.', '58.  Having regard to the absence of family, social or psychological problems on the part of the deceased, the fact that he had been at a guard post assigned to one of his fellow servicemen and to the position and distance (point-blank range) of the shot, the inquiry concluded that the incident had been an accident. It seems, however, that the possibility of unlawful killing was considered at the beginning of the inquiry.', '59.  On 30 June 2004, holding that there were no grounds for finding that another person had been responsible for Cihan Tunç’s death, the prosecution service issued a decision not to bring a prosecution. The prosecutor set out all of the evidence gathered during the investigation. He concluded that the shot had been fired when the young man, with his chest bent, had been leaning towards his right side and the barrel of the rifle was pointed towards his neck, adding that this explained, in particular, the bullet impact on the ceiling. However, the prosecutor’s decision did not state why the shot had suddenly been fired.', '60.  On 16 July 2004 the prosecutor, in response to a request from the applicants’ lawyer, sent her a letter and a copy of the decision, indicating that, in application of the Lawyers Act, the entire case file was at her disposal, and that she could examine it and have a copy made of any item of evidence she thought it appropriate to obtain.', '61.  Furthermore, a copy of the decision not to bring a prosecution was served in person on Aysel Tunç, a sister of the deceased, on 27 July 2004.', '62.  The applicants appealed against the decision, alleging that several grey areas remained as to the circumstances of Cihan Tunç’s death. In particular, they claimed that the trajectory followed by the bullet had not been clearly defined. They did not refer to the fact that M.D. had not been questioned, or that no fingerprint tests had been conducted on the weapon.', '63.  On 14 October 2004 the military court of the Diyarbakır 2nd Air-force Corps upheld the applicants’ appeal and ordered the prosecution service to carry out an additional investigation. In particular, it considered that the bullet’s trajectory and the firing position needed to be clearly established, on the basis of the entry and exit wounds on the body and the impact mark of the bullet on the ceiling. It also indicated that no plausible grounds for suicide had been identified. It added that, in any event, the position of the body at the time of the shot had been unusual for a suicide. Lastly, it stated that no explanation had been provided for the gunshot residue on the hands of M.S., the last person to have seen Cihan Tunç before the incident.', '64.  On 24 November 2004 the military prosecutor visited the Perenco site, accompanied by three criminal investigation experts.', '65.  The group went to the guard post where the incident had taken place. Once all of the materials in the case file had been examined, a reconstruction of the events was carried out, assisted by an individual who was similar in build to the deceased.', '66.  Steps to determine the bullet’s trajectory were taken, including the use of a string, stretched between the impact mark on the ceiling and the barrel of a G-3 rifle. Photographs were taken.', '67.  The experts noted that the floor was made of concrete, although the previous records described an earthen floor. According to information provided by the site managers, various premises, including several dirt tracks, had been cemented over since the incident, with a view to keeping the soldiers’ uniforms clean. The floors had not been raised during this work. This point was confirmed by measurements which established that the ceiling height was still 2.33 metres, as it had been at the time of the incident.', '68.  In the light of all the evidence gathered, the experts reached the following conclusion: Cihan Tunç had been sitting or crouching and was holding his rifle in his right hand; while he was attempting to stand up by leaning on his weapon, and with his knees still bent, his hand had pulled the trigger and the shot had been fired.', '69.  During his visit to the site, the prosecutor questioned private E.C., the other soldiers on duty at the time of the incident having completed their military service. E.C. stated that, when he arrived, M.S. was crouching down behind Cihan Tunç and was trying to lift him up by pulling him under the arms.', '70.  All of this evidence was set out in a report dated 24 November 2004.', '71.  On 8 December 2004 the prosecutor completed the investigations and sent the file to the military court, together with a report on the additional investigation requested (report no. 2004/632E.O), in which he set out the measures taken and responded to the shortcomings noted by the court. With regard to the traces of gunshot on the hands, he pointed out that the file contained an expert report indicating that gunshot residue was very volatile and that it could have moved from the dead man’s clothes or hands to M.S.’s hands immediately after the incident. He added that several statements supported that hypothesis, in that they confirmed that M.S. had been in physical contact with the deceased when attempting to lift him up.', '72.  With regard to the court’s observation that the firing position hardly corresponded to that of an individual who intended to commit suicide and its argument about the lack of a motive, the prosecutor stated that the decision not to prosecute contained no indication that the incident had been a suicide and, indeed, that the hypothesis of suicide had not been entertained.', '73.  As to determination of the bullet’s trajectory in the light of the impact mark on the ceiling and the entry and exit wounds on the body, the prosecutor stated that the following hypothesis had been accepted: Cihan Tunç had been sitting on an ammunition box and playing with the rifle’s cocking lever and magazine; while he was holding the weapon, with the magazine removed and at an angle on his right side, he had leaned forward and towards his right side with the intention of using the rifle to support himself in standing up, his hand on the part of the weapon near the trigger, and the shot had gone off; the bullet had entered through the right side of his neck and emerged under the lower edge of the left shoulder-blade, before hitting the ceiling; thus, Cihan Tunç had not committed suicide, he had been the victim of an accident. The prosecutor added that he had organised a reconstruction of the scene on 24 November 2004 in order to ascertain the credibility of this hypothesis, having regard to the bullet’s entry and exit points, the point of impact on the ceiling and the deceased man’s build, and that the conclusions of the reconstruction confirmed this sequence of events.', '74.  The record of the reconstruction of the incident was attached to this report.', '75.  On 17 December 2004 the military court dismissed the applicants’ appeal.', '76.  A letter dated 21 December 2004 was sent to the applicants’ lawyer, informing her of that decision. Neither the date of posting nor the date of receipt of that letter is specified in the case file. The applicants submitted that they had received the letter in question at the end of December 2004. The Government made no submissions on this point.', '77.  The applicants submitted a private medical report, prepared at their request by a British expert, Dr Allen M. Anscombe, and dated 11 October 2005. The expert drew up his report in English, on the basis of his examination of a number of documents from the case file which had been translated into that language. The relevant parts of this report read as follows:\\n“I am a Consultant Forensic Pathologist, accredited by the Home Office Policy Advisory Board for Forensic Pathology (...).\\nIn preparing this report I have been provided with English translations of the following documents relating to Cihan Tunç: 4.  Three colour images of the deceased, one taken in life and two taken post mortem, when the deceased is apparently within a coffin. 5.  An image of a G-3 rifle.\\n...\\nThe deceased was taken to a nearby Military Hospital and the autopsy examination carried out later on the day of his death. Such promptness should be regarded as a good practice.\\n...\\nInitial examination then appears to involve removing the clothing from the deceased and the photographing it, collection of samples for forensic laboratory investigation, and recording detail content of pockets, etc.\\nIn itself, this process appears to have been carried out appropriately, with collection of appropriate samples given the nature of the incident.\\nHaving completed this stage, the [autopsy] report appears to indicate that the pathologist Dr. E. was ‘called in’, by which I understand had his first opportunity to examine the deceased.\\nIf my understanding is correct, this would cause me some considerable concern because, particularly in the case of shooting fatality, the pathologist should be given as much information as possible as regards the scene and state of the deceased, the latter including the opportunity to inspect and examine the undisturbed clothing.\\n...\\nThe remainder of the details of the autopsy examination are somewhat brief and sketchy.\\nOtherwise, the essential autopsy examination findings are included in the report. The conclusion as to the cause of death is reasonable in the light of the stated autopsy findings (i.e. there are no internally inconsistent findings and conclusions).\\n...\\nCihan Tunç sustained a gunshot entry wound to the front side of his neck, and an exit wound on the back of the left shoulder. The photographs demonstrate a small entry wound, and a larger exit wound, and there is in my opinion no possibility that entry and exit have been got “the wrong way round”.\\nIf the bullet has passed through the deceased and embedded itself in the ceiling, then the only way that I can conceive this trajectory of being achievable, is if the deceased was bent over the moment the gun discharged.\\nThe autopsy report indicated that traces of unburned gunpowder were found on the right side of the face and on the curve of the lower jaw, but there was no smoke staining or burning of the skin. This indicates that the muzzle end of the barrel was close to but not in contact with the skin of the deceased. Whilst such discharge deposits depend to some extent on the nature of the weapon and ammunition used, the likely range of fire (i.e. muzzle to skin distance) would be in the region of 15-30 cm.\\nI am informed that the length of a G3 rifle, believed to be the sort used by the deceased, is 102.3cm. From the image provided, the trigger is approximately two thirds of the length of the rifle away from the muzzle. Depending on the length of the deceased’s arm, the trigger might just be reachable (say with an outstretched finger), if he was bent over the rifle at the time.\\nThe only two other possibilities I can think of are that either the rifle malfunctioned and discharged unexpectedly for some reason (e. g. it was dropped on the floor, or that the rifle was fired by another person – however, this would require that person to be lying on the floor pointing the rifle upwards with the deceased bent over the muzzle (his neck at a distance of 15 – 30 cm) at the time.\\nThere were no autopsy signs that the deceased had been involved in a struggle or a fight.”', '78.  On 13 January 2005 the applicants’ lawyer brought an action before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, seeking payment of pecuniary compensation on account of Cihan Tunç’s death.', '79.  Following the dismissal of the notice of claim on procedural grounds, a new claim was lodged on 9 September 2005. The applicants claimed 3,500 Turkish lira (TRY) in respect of pecuniary damage and TRY 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage for each of the parents, and TRY 1,000 for each of the deceased’s seven brothers and sisters.', '80.  On 9 October 2006 the expert appointed by the Supreme Military Administrative Court to evaluate the pecuniary damage submitted his report. He estimated the damage at TRY 721 for the deceased’s father and TRY 8,779 for his mother. The parties did not challenge that evaluation.', '81.  On 10 January 2007 the court allowed the applicants’ claims in part. It noted that the death had been caused by careless handling of the service rifle. It considered that this implied a lack of sufficient training in handling weapons and negligence in the supervision and protection of conscripts. In consequence, it found that the death was partly imputable to negligence by the authorities. Having regard also to the existence of contributory negligence by the deceased, and pointing out that it was bound by the claim and could not rule ultra petita, the Supreme Military Administrative Court awarded the following sums:\\n-  TRY 3,500 in respect of pecuniary damage and TRY 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the deceased’s mother;\\n-  TRY 400 in respect of pecuniary damage and TRY 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the deceased’s father;\\n-  TRY 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to each of the deceased’s brothers and sisters.\\nThose amounts bore late-payment interest, to be calculated from the date of the incident to the date of payment.', '82.  On 12 June 2007 the authorities made a payment of TRY 23,500 (approximately 13,200 euros (EUR) on that date) to the Bakırköy Enforcement Office, to which a request had been made by the applicants’ lawyer.', '83.  The applicants claim that they had been unaware of those proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court until they were mentioned by the Government, and that no sum has been paid to them by their lawyer.', '84.  On 21 April 2004 the Mehmetçik Foundation, an emanation of the armed forces which was set up to support the families of soldiers who die in service, awarded 4,916,700,000 former Turkish lira (a little over 3,000 euros at that date) to the deceased man’s family in financial assistance.'], 'applicants': ['MUSTAFA TUNÇ', 'FECİRE TUNÇ'], 'defendants': ['TURKEY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['2', '34'], 'violated_articles': [], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['105', '206', '245', '247', '27', '37', '40', '52', '60', '62', '63', '67', '72', '73', '86', '87', '88', '89', '95']}, 'silver_rationales': [16, 26, 29, 41, 49, 51, 52, 56, 61, 62], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [16, 26, 29, 41, 49, 51, 52, 56, 61, 62], 'explained_indices': [36, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 53, 46, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 45, 54, 55, 56, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 38, 37, 73, 35, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 72, 18, 19, 20, 21, 17, 23, 34, 22, 32, 31, 30, 33, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 29, 6, 0, 5, 8, 7, 1, 4, 2, 3], 'explained_distances': [-0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.043284595, -0.1078769, -0.16216177, -0.17166048, -0.17801559, -0.19678086, -0.19933969, -0.2260564, -0.25673658, -0.25913984], 'number_of_sentences': 74, 'article_id': 7, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Cracow.', '6.  On 14 January 1999 criminal charges were brought against the applicant. He was suspected of armed robberies, committed in an organised criminal group. The applicant was in hiding at the material time.', '7.  On 29 January 1999 an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant by the Polish authorities. After having been unsuccessfully sought for many months, he was eventually detained in Spain on 23 October 2001 and remanded in custody.', \"8.  Subsequently, action was taken with a view to the applicant's extradition and on 21 October 2002, the Spanish authorities handed him over to Poland.\", '9.  On 24 October 2002 the Katowice District Court ordered that the applicant remain in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The court considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and induce witnesses to give false testimony or go underground again (he had earlier been in hiding in Spain). It further stressed the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that the applicant had been acting in an organised criminal group.', \"10.  The applicant's appeal against the detention order was dismissed by the Katowice Regional Court on 23 December 2002. Likewise, his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him were unsuccessful. In his applications and appeals he relied on his personal circumstances, in particular his poor health, stressing that he had been infected with an HCV virus.\", \"11.  In the course of the investigation, the applicant's detention was prolonged on several occasions, namely by the Katowice Regional Court's decisions of 16 January, 20 March and 8 September 2003, 16 January and 20 September 2004, 14 January, 6 June and 14 November 2005, 24 April and 20 October 2006 and the Katowice Court of Appeal's decisions of 8 August 2007 and 6 February 2008. In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant's detention. In addition, they stressed the existence of a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by an extensive body of evidence from witnesses and experts. Further, they attached importance to the grave nature of the charges against him and the fact that a “wanted” notice had been issued for his arrest.\", '12.  On 3 March 2003 the Regional Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Częstochowa Regional Court. The applicant was charged with inter alia numerous counts of armed robberies committed in an organised criminal group.', '13.  On 27 March 2003 the Częstochowa Regional Court requested the Supreme Court that the case be transferred to the Katowice Regional Court. The court stressed the special nature of the case, which implied that exceptional security measures be taken and special facilities provided. On 14 May 2003 the Supreme Court granted the request.', \"14.  Between 18 November 2002 and 16 September 2005 the applicant served a prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings (on the strength of the Cracow District Court's judgment of 23 February 1998).\", \"15.  On 14 April 2008 the Katowice Regional Court granted the applicant's request to be released on bail. On 16 April 2008 the applicant was released as he had paid bail of 350,000 Polish zlotys (PLN).\", '16.

Mr Hatip Dicle and Mr Selim Sadak, who were MPs in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and members of the DEP political party (Democracy Party), which has since been dissolved by the Constitutional Court, were arrested on 2 March 1994 and 1 July 1994 respectively.', '7.  On 8 December 1994 they were sentenced by the Ankara State Security Court to fifteen years’ imprisonment for belonging to an illegal organisation, pursuant to Article 168 § 2 of the Penal Code.', '8.  By judgment of 26 October 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld that judicial decision.', '9.

Turkey (no. 1) (nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, ECHR 2001‑VIII), a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, as well as a violation of Article 6 § 3 (a), (b) and (d) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 on the grounds that the applicants had not received timely information on the reclassification of the charges against them and had been unable to question the prosecution witnesses or to have them questioned.', '10.  On 9 December 2004, at the 906th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies at the Council of Europe, the Committee of Ministers adopted a Final Resolution (ResDH(2004)86) on the judgment of the Court in the case of Sadak and Others, cited above. The relevant passages of that Resolution read as follows:\\n“The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as amended by Protocol No. 11 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Convention’),\\nHaving regard to the final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Sadak and others case delivered on 17 July 2001 and transmitted the same day to the Committee of Ministers under Article 46 of the Convention;\\nRecalling that the case originated in several applications (nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96) against Turkey, lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights on 17 January 1996 under former Article 25 of the Convention by Mr Selim Sadak, Ms Leyla Zana, Mr Hatip Dicle and Mr Orhan Doğan, four Turkish nationals, and that the Commission declared admissible the complaints relating to the lack of fairness of the criminal proceedings conducted against them, to the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court which convicted them, in 1994, to 15 years’ imprisonment for belonging to an armed organisation, as well as to the discriminatory violation of their right of freedom of expression and freedom of association;\\nWhereas in its judgment of 17 July 2001 the Court unanimously:\\n- held that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court;\\n- held that there had been a violation of Article 6, paragraphs 3 (a), (b) and (d), of the Convention, taken together with paragraph 1, on account of the fact that the applicants were not notified in good time that the charges against them had been altered and that they were unable to examine or have examined the witnesses against them;\\n- held that it was not necessary to examine the other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention;\\n- held that it was not necessary to examine the complaints under Articles 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention;\\n- held that the government of the respondent state was to pay, within three months, USD 25 000 to each of the four applicants in respect of all heads of damage taken together; USD 10 000 to all the applicants together in respect of costs and expenses, and that simple interest at an annual rate of 6% would be payable on those sums from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\\n- dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction;\\nHaving regard to the Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers concerning the application of Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention;\\nHaving invited the Government of the respondent state to inform it of the measures which had been taken in consequence of the judgment of 17 July 2001, having regard to Turkey’s obligation under Article 46, paragraph 1, of the Convention to abide by it;\\nWhereas during the examination of the case by the Committee of Ministers, the government of the respondent state gave the Committee information about the measures taken in order to erase the consequences for the applicants of the violations found by the Court and to prevent new violations of the same kind as those found in the present judgment; this information appears in the appendix to this resolution;\\nHaving satisfied itself that, on 16 October 2001, within the time-limit set, the government of the respondent state paid the applicants the sums provided for in the judgment of 17 July 2001;\\nRecalling, as far as individual measures are concerned, Interim Resolution ResDH(2002)59 of 30 April 2002 in which the Committee requested the reopening of the criminal proceedings against the applicants or the adoption of other ad hoc measures to erase the consequences of their unfair conviction, as well as Interim Resolution ResDH(2004)31 of 6 April 2004 by which the Committee, stressing the importance of the presumption of innocence, requested that the applicants be released pending the outcome of their new trial in the absence of any compelling reasons justifying their continued detention;\\nHaving noted with satisfaction that, on 14 July 2004, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 21 April 2004 of the Ankara State Security Court confirming the applicants’ previous conviction, that, since June 2004, the applicants are no longer in detention following the suspension of the execution of their sentence, that restrictions on their travel abroad were removed on 16 September 2004, that the applicants are no longer deemed to be convicted and that a new trial is currently pending before the Ankara 11th Criminal Court;\\nConsidering that, since the violation found by the European Court concerned the fairness of the incriminated proceedings and not their outcome, it is not necessary to await the outcome of the new trial;\\nDeclares, after having examined the information supplied by the Government of Turkey, that it has exercised its functions under Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention in this case.”', '11.   Meanwhile, on 3 February 2003, Act No. 4793 reforming a number of previous Acts came into force. It added to Article 327 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CPP) a new paragraph 6 providing for the reopening of criminal proceedings following a finding of a violation by the European Court of Human Rights.', '12.  On 4 February 2003 the applicants requested the reopening of proceedings on the basis of the judgment delivered by the Court in their case.', '13.  On 21 April 2004, having ordered the reopening of the proceedings against the applicants pursuant to Article 327 § 6 CPP, the Ankara State Security Court reiterated its judgment of 8 December 1994. In the grounds for the judgment it mainly used the words “accused (convicted)” with reference to the applicants. Occasionally it used the words “convicted (accused)” with reference to Mr Selim Sadak and the word “convicted” with reference to Mr Hatip Dicle.', '14.  On 8 June 2004 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the 21 April 2004 judgment of the State Security Court. In that appeal they requested their release under Article 38 of the Constitution, relying on their right to the presumption of innocence. They argued that under Article 338 CPP the acceptance of the reopening of proceedings had invalidated the finality of their first conviction. They pointed out that in the event of an application for reopening of proceedings the law was silent on the issue of the execution of the initial sentence and on the conduct of the future proceedings. The applicants submitted that the absence of provisions in that regard did not mean that there was a legal vacuum provided that any proceedings reopened returned to the trial phase. They added that persons being retried no longer had the status of convicted persons, which meant that the restriction on their liberty could no longer be considered as being in “execution” of the sentence initially imposed on them. Consequently, they concluded that the reopening of the proceedings had given them prisoner status, and that they had therefore lost their “convict” status.', '15.  Subsequently the applicants submitted another brief memorial to the Court of Cassation, arguing, in particular, that by referring to them as “convicted persons” the State Security Court had flouted their right to the presumption of innocence. Indeed, they took the view that since proceedings had been reopened their conviction was no longer res judicata and therefore that they should no longer have been considered as convicted persons and their right to the presumption of innocence should have been respected, pursuant to Article 38 of the Constitution and Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.', '16.  On 9 June 2004 the Court of Cassation ordered the applicants’ release.', '17.  By judgment du 13 July 2004 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 21 April 2004, stating that the violations found by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment of 17 July 2001 had not been remedied. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows:\\n“III.  The procedural phase following the reopening of the proceedings\\nIt is accepted, in both legal practice and legal theory, that where an application for a reopening of proceedings pursuant to the ... Code of Criminal Procedure is accepted, the investigation which must be conducted [after the reopening of proceedings] is independent and distinct from the previous investigation, and the decision to reopen the proceedings provides the basis for that fresh investigation. As stated in the judgment of the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation of 5. 11. 1990 (E. 8/220 and K. 258), the hearings to be organised [in the framework of the new trial] are not the continuation of those held previously, and all the procedural rules must be applied to those hearings as if the case were being tried for the first time. The assessment of new evidence, of the nature of the offence and of the sentencing in the framework of the hearings to be held when the proceedings are reopened must be conducted quite independently and separately from the assessment during the initial proceedings, and new pieces of evidence ... may be gathered and examined.\\nIV.  Conclusion\\n...\\n2 – The proceedings as reopened under the relevant decision is completely independent from the previous proceedings; in accordance with that principle, all the legal rules of procedure must be applied to the new hearings, the indictment must be read out, the reclassification of charges must be notified and fresh interrogations must be conducted ...”', '18.  The State Security Courts having in the meantime been abolished under Act No. 5190, the Court of Cassation referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court (“the Assize Court”).', '19.  On 1 June 2005 the new Turkish Penal Code came into force. The offence of belonging to an armed band formerly set out in Article 168 is now governed by Article 314 of the new Penal Code.', '20.  On 9 March 2007, having taken note, in particular, of the Court of Cassation’s argument that the procedure for reopening the trial was completely independent from the initial one, the Assize Court upheld the conviction of 8 December 1994. It nevertheless reduced the applicants’ sentence to a prison term of seven years and six months pursuant to Article 314 § 2 of the Penal Code. In the reasoning of its decision the court used the words “accused (convicted person)” with reference to the applicants.', '21.  On 27 February 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment.', '22.  Meanwhile, on 19 May 2007, the Higher Electoral Council had issued a decision setting out the conditions to be met by candidates – including independent candidates with no party political affiliation – standing for the parliamentary elections of 22 July 2007. The relevant part of that decision read as follows:\\n“1.  ... After serving final sentences ... [the candidate] must, pursuant to section 13/A of the Law on the register of police records, provide, for each conviction, a document certifying that he has recovered his civil rights and that the conviction has become res judicata.\\n... 3.  Pursuant to the Penal Code ... save in cases of negligence, persons who have been sentenced to a prison term of twelve months or more or who have been convicted of an offence, pursuant to section 11 (f) of Act No. 2839 on the election of members of parliament and whose prison sentence has become res judicata, must provide a document certifying that they have, or are deemed to have, served their sentence.”', '23.  On 10 May 2007, Mr Hatip Dicle applied to the Ankara Assize Court for a document establishing that he had indeed served his full prison term.', '24.  In its 15 May 2007 decision the Assize Court held as follows:\\n“In applying to the convicted person the provisions of Act No. 5237 on the entry into force of [the Penal Code] of 1 June 2005, it was decided to sentence Mehmet Hatip Dicle to a prison term of seven years and six months, to apply section 53 of Act No. 5237 and to deduct from that sentence the period which he had served in detention.\\nThe State Prosecutor has filed an appeal on points of law against that judgment, but the latter has not yet become final.\\nThe convicted person Mehmet Hatip Dicle, whose sentence was commuted to seven years and six months pursuant to the provisions [of the Penal Code], was remanded in custody from 2 March 1994 to 17 March 1994, and imprisoned from 17 March 1994 to 9 June 2004 as a detainee and then as a convicted person.\\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, the final sentence to be imposed on Mehmet Hatip Dicle for belonging to an illegal armed organisation is a prison term of fifteen years ... In order to serve that sentence, he was held in prison for the aforementioned periods.\\nPursuant to the provisions of the Penal Code [in respect of the applicant], this court delivered judgment on 9 March 2007 (E. 2004/343 and K. 2007/67) reducing the fifteen-year prison sentence to a term of seven years and six months. Since that judgment is not yet final it has not become res judicata. Consequently, it is impossible to indicate the date on which the sentence was completed. However, [it may be said that] the sentence served by the convicted person up to the date of his release corresponds to a sentence of seven years and six months...\\nOn those grounds:\\nThis court cannot lawfully adjudicate on the application lodged by the convicted person Mehmet Hatip Dicle for a document certifying that he has served the full sentence imposed on him, firstly because the decision to reduce his sentence to seven years and six months has not yet become final, and secondly because the [initial] judgment sentencing him to a fifteen-year term did become res judicata and he was released on account of the stay of execution of that sentence.”', '25.  On 1 and 4 June 2007 Mr Hatip Dicle and Mr Selim Sadak submitted their names as independent candidates for the parliamentary elections of 22 July 2007 in the constituencies of Diyarbakır and Şırnak respectively. They provided, inter alia, copies of their police records mentioning their 8 December 1994 conviction by the State Security Court and the decision given by the Assize Court on 15 May 2007.', '26.

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Celje. She is an advocate practising in Celje.', '7.  In 2001, the applicant was representing M.Š. in civil proceedings for compensation for injuries which M.Š. had allegedly sustained in a physical attack by the defendant. The proceedings were conducted before the Domžale Local Court sitting in a formation of a single judge. The judge in the case was Judge M., a Ljubljana Higher Court judge who had been temporarily appointed to the local court.', '8.  It appears from the transcript of the hearing of 28 November 2001 that the applicant was not permitted to ask the defendant certain questions as they were considered suggestive by Judge M. Her proposal that a witness be heard was also rejected, as this evidence was not considered necessary by the judge.', '9.  On 28 November 2001 the Domžale Local Court delivered a judgment rejecting M.Š.’s claim for compensation.', '10.  On 27 December 2001 the applicant’s client appealed. In the appeal statement drafted by the applicant, Judge M. was criticised for not putting on record some of his procedural decisions and for not including the applicant’s client’s statements in full. It stated, inter alia:\\n“It would be reasonable to expect that the judge of a higher court would explain before the trial hearing why it is he who is presiding over this case which ... is being considered at first instance; this is what the judicial code of behaviour would expect him to do. However, the judge was trampling on that code of behaviour by behaving arrogantly and chewing gum during the hearing, and by covering his mouth while talking.\\nOn 28 November 2001 proceedings were held before the Domžale Local Court following the principle of the inquisitorial system. The transcript of the hearing shows that [the proceedings] were not carried out in accordance with the Civil Procedure Act.... The judge, despite requests, did not include in the transcript the statements and messages which were given by the plaintiff or her representative...\\nThe judge asked the plaintiff whether she understood the Slovenian language, and she confirmed that she did. However, he then chewed gum during the interview, so that the plaintiff could not understand him.\\nFollowing this superficial evidence-taking, the judge, without deciding on the other requests for evidence, concluded the hearing. For that reason, the facts of the case were wrongly and insufficiently established...”', '11.  On 26 May 2004 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the appeal in the part concerning compensation for bodily injuries. However, it rejected the complaints concerning the alleged procedural defects and inaccuracy of the transcript of the hearing. In particular, the court found that the transcript had been signed by the parties without objection and that none of the parties had challenged the impartiality of the judge by instituting proceedings to that effect.', '12.  On 8 January 2002 Judge M., having received the appeal against his judgment of 28 November 2001, issued a decision fining the applicant 150,000 Slovenian tolars (SIT) for contempt of court for her statements in the appeal. It stated that the fine should be paid within fifteen days. The decision reads as follows:\\n“In the above civil case, the plaintiff’s representative Alenka Pečnik, attorney, lodged an appeal against judgment no. P 107/97 of this court. In the appeal she gravely insults the presiding judge by stating that he was trampling on the judicial code of behaviour by behaving arrogantly, chewing gum and covering his mouth while communicating with those present at the hearing, and that the proceedings were conducted on an inquisitorial basis. These are insulting and invented allegations and for that reason a monetary fine has been imposed on the plaintiff’s representative on the basis of section 109 read together with section 11, paragraphs 3 to 7, of the Civil Procedure Act. The monetary fine for the attorney can be set up to SIT 1,000,000. Since the present case involves a grave insult, the court considers that the appropriate penalty should be SIT 150,000.”', '13.  On 29 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal, alleging an incorrect application of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as “the CPC”) and an incorrect assessment of the facts. In particular, she stated that her statements were true and were not intended to insult the judge but to describe the atmosphere during the hearing, where the judge had repeatedly raised his voice. She also stated that her client was not a native speaker of Slovenian and had been unable to understand the judge because of his behaviour. She claimed that her remarks had been taken out of context, and submitted statements by her client and a witness in support of her allegations.', '14.  In her appeal the applicant also requested that the venue of the proceedings be changed, as Judge M. was a judge of the Ljubljana Higher Court, which would normally have had jurisdiction to decide the appeal. Her request was upheld and the case was transferred to the Koper Higher Court.', '15.  On 8 April 2003 the Koper Higher Court rejected the applicant’s appeal. If found that although the impugned decision relied on statements which had been taken out of context, these statements were indeed insulting and the tone of the appeal in question was in any event inappropriate. The fact that the applicant tried to tone down the impugned allegations in her appeal undermined her credibility and supported the first-instance court’s conclusion that the allegations were invented. Finally, the Koper Higher Court found that the applicant could have defended her client’s interest by using proper language, without insults.', '16.  On 12 May 2003 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal. Citing Articles 14, 21, 22 and 23 of the Constitution, the applicant complained that she had been convicted of contempt of court in proceedings which had been unfair and biased. In her submission, it was unacceptable that a judge who felt personally affected by the impugned statements could convict her and impose a penalty, which could be converted to imprisonment. Furthermore, no evidence apart from that provided by the judge himself was examined in the proceedings, and the Higher Court rejected the appeal by relying merely on the statements of the judge. The applicant alleged that the purpose of the statements she had made in the appeal at issue was to draw attention to the inappropriate behaviour of the presiding judge. These were statements of fact, and were supported by the transcript of the hearing and witness statements. They were not made with the intention of humiliating the presiding judge but in defence of her client’s interests.', '17.  On 27 May 2003 the applicant paid the fine.', '18.  Declaring the appeal admissible on 26 October 2004, the Constitutional Court delivered its decision on the merits on 27 October 2005. Referring to its conclusion concerning judicial impartiality in the decision of 23 June 2005 (see paragraph 21 below), the Constitutional Court found (by five votes to four) that the applicant’s right to an impartial tribunal had not been violated. The Constitutional Court then reviewed the reasons for sentencing the applicant given by the lower courts. It agreed with the lower courts that the applicant’s statements did not represent a legitimate exercise of a lawyer’s duty to defend her client’s interest. It noted that a judicial decision could always be criticised in a way that did not involve an attack on the reputation of the judiciary or a personal attack on a particular judge.'], 'applicants': ['ALENKA PEČNIK'], 'defendants': ['SLOVENIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['18', '19', '20', '21', '26', '27', '29']}, 'silver_rationales': [12], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [12], 'explained_indices': [3, 1, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2, 4], 'explained_distances': [-0.00049273693, -0.0006110617, -0.0007697034, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.0011891348, -0.005048019, -0.0055965288], 'number_of_sentences': 13, 'article_id': 0, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1967 and is living in The Hague.', '9.  In March 1987 the applicant met and started a relationship with Mr W., who – like the applicant – was born and had always lived in Suriname. Both of them had acquired Surinamese nationality in 1975 when Suriname gained its independence (Article 3 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname concerning the assignment of nationality (Toescheidingsovereenkomst inzake nationaliteiten tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Suriname), see paragraph 62 below). In September 1989, the applicant and Mr W. started to cohabit in the house of the latter’s paternal grandfather in Suriname.', '10.  On 19 October 1991, Mr W. travelled from Suriname to the Netherlands, holding a Netherlands visa for the purpose of stay with his father in the Netherlands. In 1993, Mr W. was granted Netherlands nationality which entailed the renunciation of his Surinamese nationality.', '11.  Mr W. has one sister, two brothers and one half-brother who are living in the Netherlands. Two other half-brothers and one half-sister are living in Suriname. The applicant has one brother, G., who was expelled from the Netherlands to Suriname in 2009. The applicant has also one half-brother and one half-sister who are living in the Netherlands. She has another half-sister who is living in Suriname.', '12.  Between 1991 and 1995, the applicant filed five unsuccessful requests for a Netherlands visa for the purpose of visiting a relative. These requests were rejected because her sponsor (referent) was insufficiently solvent, had failed to sign the required affidavit of support (garantverklaring) or had failed to supply sufficient information required for the assessment of the visa request. The applicant did not challenge any of these rejections in administrative appeal proceedings.', '13.  On 19 November 1996 the applicant filed a sixth visa request for the purpose of visiting a relative. After this request had been granted on 4 March 1997, the applicant entered the Netherlands on 12 March 1997 and did not return to Suriname when her visa expired 45 days later. To date, she has been staying in the Netherlands. She lived in Rotterdam until 20 July 1998, when she moved to The Hague. Since 17 December 1998 she has been living at the same address in The Hague.', '14.  On 20 October 1997, the applicant applied for a residence permit. According to the applicant, she had done so for the purpose of taking up residence with her Netherlands-national partner Mr W. According to the Government, the applicant’s stated aim had been to take up “paid employment”. On 16 February 1998, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) decided not to process the application (buiten behandeling stellen) as the applicant had on two occasions failed to appear in person before the immigration authorities for the purpose of giving further information about her application. When, on 13 February 1998, the applicant’s lawyer had requested a new appointment on the ground that she would be unable to attend the interview scheduled for 16 February 1998, she was informed by the immigration authorities that – despite her lawyer’s absence – the applicant should appear in person. The applicant did not appear on 16 February 1998. The Deputy Minister’s decision of 16 February 1998 was notified to the applicant on 23 February 1998 and she was ordered to leave the Netherlands within seven days.', '15.  The applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against the decision of 16 February 1998. As this objection was denied suspensive effect, she applied for a provisional measure (voorlopige voorziening) in the form of a court injunction preventing her expulsion pending the determination of her objection. This application was rejected on 23 December 1999 by the Acting President of the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. The applicant’s objection against the decision of 16 February 1998 was rejected by the Deputy Minister on 17 January 2000. The applicant’s appeal against this decision to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure were rejected on 12 July 2001 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Utrecht. No further appeal lay against this ruling.', '16.  In the meantime, the applicant had married Mr W. on 25 June 1999 and, in September 2000, a son was born of this marriage. Under the Netherlands nationality rules, the applicant’s child is a Netherlands national. Since the child was unwell, he required lengthy treatment in hospital. He is currently attending secondary school and has no health problems.', '17.  On 20 April 2001, the applicant applied unsuccessfully for a residence permit on the basis of the so-called three-year policy (driejarenbeleid) or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature. Under this three-year policy a residence permit could be granted if a request for such a permit had not been determined within a period of three years for reasons not imputable to the petitioner and provided that there were no contra-indications such as, for instance, a criminal record. In the course of the proceedings on this request, the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam granted the applicant’s request for a provisional measure (injunction on removal) on 23 February 2004. The final decision was given on 17 May 2004 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam.', '18.  On 10 December 2005, a second child was born of the applicant’s marriage. This child also holds Netherlands nationality.', '19.  On 23 January 2007, the applicant filed a request for a residence permit for the purpose of stay with her children in the Netherlands. This request was rejected because the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf). Such a visa has to be applied for at a Netherlands mission in the petitioner’s country of origin and it is a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit (verblijfsvergunning) which confers more permanent residence rights. The applicant was not exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. She challenged this decision unsuccessfully in administrative appeal proceedings in which the final decision was taken by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem on 19 April 2007.', '20.  On 7 May 2007, the applicant requested the Deputy Minister of Justice to reconsider (heroverwegen) the negative decision on her last request. On 28 September 2007, the applicant filed a complaint with the Deputy Minister on account of the latter’s failure to reply to her request for reconsideration. By letter of 12 November 2007, the Deputy Minister informed the applicant that although her complaint concerning delay was well-founded there was no reason for a reconsideration of the decision.', '21.  On 28 September 2007, the applicant applied for a grant of a residence permit at the discretion of the Deputy Minister (conform beschikking staatssecretaris) based on grounds of special and individual circumstances (vanwege bijzondere en individuele omstandigheden).', '22.  On 7 July 2008, the Deputy Minister of Justice rejected this application. The applicant filed an objection with the Deputy Minister against this decision as well as an application to the Regional Court of The Hague for a provisional measure (injunction on removal pending the objection proceedings). On 17 November 2008, having noted that this request was not opposed by the Deputy Minister, the Regional Court of The Hague granted the provisional measure. On 11 March 2009, after a hearing on the applicant’s objection held on 15 January 2009, the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant’s objection.', '23.  The applicant’s appeal against the decision of 11 March 2009 to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure in the form of an injunction on her removal pending the determination of her appeal were rejected on 8 December 2009 by the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. In its relevant part, this ruling reads as follows:\\n“2.11  It is not in dispute that the appellant does not hold a valid provisional residence visa and that she is not eligible for an exemption from the requirement to hold such a visa under section 17 § 1 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000) or section 3.71 § 2 of the Aliens Decree 2000 (Vreemdelingenbesluit 2000). It is only in dispute whether reason dictates that the defendant should exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on the basis of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree [for reasons of exceptional hardship (onbillijkheid van overwegende aard)]. 2.12  The Regional Court finds that the defendant could reasonably conclude that in the present case there are no special and individual circumstances on the basis of which insistence on compliance with the visa requirement would entail exceptional hardship. ... 2.18  The appellant’s reliance on Article 8 of the Convention fails. There is family life between the appellant and her husband and her minor children, but the defendant’s refusal to exempt her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa does not constitute an interference with the right to respect for family life as the defendant’s decision did not deprive her of a residence permit enabling her to enjoy her family life in the Netherlands. 2.19  It does not appear that there is a positive obligation for the Netherlands State under Article 8 of the Convention to exempt the applicant, contrary to the policy pursued in this area, from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. It is of importance at the outset that there has been no appearance of any objective obstacle to the enjoyment of family life outside the Netherlands. Taking into account the young age of the appellant’s children, it can also reasonably be expected that they would follow the appellant to Suriname for the duration of the proceedings relating to the provisional residence visa. This is not altered by the fact that both children are Netherlands nationals. The fact that the appellant’s husband is currently being detained gives no cause for finding that ... there is an objective obstacle. 2.20  The appellant has cited the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva [and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006‑I], Said Botan [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1869/04, 10 March 2009] and Ibrahim Mohamed [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1872/04, 10 March 2009]. This cannot succeed, for the following reasons. The case of Rodrigues da Silva did not concern a temporary separation in connection with maintaining the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, so the case cannot be said to be comparable. In the cases of Said Botan and Ibrahim Mohamed the European Court found that the reasons for lodging the complaints had been removed, because a residence permit had been granted to the complainants in those cases. For that reason, their complaints were not considered further. The Regional Court fails to see in what manner the European Court’s findings in those two cases could be of relevance to the appellant’s case. 2.21  The appellant has further invoked Article 2 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. In so far as the provisions invoked entail a directly applicable norm, they have no further implications beyond the fact that in proceedings such as those at hand, the interests of the children concerned must be taken into account. In the decision of 11 March 2009, the situation of the appellant’s two minor children was explicitly taken into account in the assessment. As the provisions invoked do not contain a norm as regards the weight that must be given in a concrete case to the interests of a child, there is no ground for finding that those provisions have been violated.', '24.  On 2 August 2009, upon his return to the Netherlands from a trip to Suriname for the funeral of his foster mother, the applicant’s husband had been found to have swallowed cocaine pellets. He was placed in pre-trial detention. On 8 October 2009, a single-judge chamber (politierechter) of the Haarlem Regional Court convicted him of offences under the Opium Act (Opiumwet) and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment. On the basis of this conviction, the Netherlands Royal Constabulary (Koninklijke Marechaussee) included his name on a blacklist provided to airline companies operating direct flights between the Netherlands and Aruba, the former Netherlands Antilles, Suriname and Venezuela. His name was to remain on the list for a period of three years, the aim being to prevent him from reoffending. On 31 December 2009, after having served his sentence, the applicant’s husband was released from prison. His name was removed from the airline blacklist on 2 August 2012.', '25.  The applicant’s appeal of 7 January 2010 to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State) against the judgment of 8 December 2009 of the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague was dismissed on 6 July 2010. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division found that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling (kan niet tot vernietiging van de aangevallen uitspraak leiden). Having regard to section 91 § 2 of the Aliens Act 2000, no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against this decision.', '26.  In the meantime, the applicant filed a fifth request on 16 April 2010 for a residence permit with the Minister of Justice (Minister van Justitie) for the purpose of stay with a child, arguing that she should be exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on grounds of special and individual circumstances.', '27.  This request was rejected on 11 May 2010 by the Minister, who held that there was no reason to exempt the applicant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa and that the refusal of a residence permit was not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. While accepting that there was family life within the meaning of Article 8 between the applicant, her husband and their children, the Minister found that there was no interference with the right to respect for family life as the refusal to grant the applicant’s request for exemption did not deprive her of a residence permit which enabled her to exercise her family life in the Netherlands.', '28.  As to the question whether the applicant’s rights under Article 8 entailed a positive obligation for the Netherlands to grant her a residence permit, the Minister found that the interests of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicant’s personal interest in exercising her right to family life in the Netherlands. In balancing these competing interests, the Minister took into account the following: already in Suriname and before her arrival in the Netherlands the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse; she had entered the Netherlands without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules; and she had created her family in the Netherlands without holding a residence permit. When it transpired in the course of the proceedings that the applicant was pregnant, the Minister further held that it had not been established, nor did it appear that the applicant would be unable – should hospitalisation be necessary – to give birth in a hospital in Suriname or that there would be any insurmountable objective obstacles to the exercise of family life in Suriname. On this point, the Minister noted that Dutch was spoken in Suriname and that the transition would not therefore be particularly difficult for the applicant’s children, who could continue their education in Suriname in a normal manner.', '29.  The Minister added that the mere fact that the applicant’s spouse and children were Netherlands nationals did not entail an automatic obligation for the Netherlands authorities to grant the applicant a residence permit, or lead to the conclusion that the exercise of family life would only be possible in the Netherlands. The Netherlands authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant’s personal choice to come to, settle and create a family in the Netherlands without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence. In the balancing exercise, the Minister attributed decisive weight to the fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the Netherlands and that there was no indication whatsoever that it would be impossible to exercise family life in Suriname.', '30.  The Minister further rejected the applicant’s argument that she ought to be exempted from the visa requirement, on the basis that inter alia the length of the applicant’s stay in the Netherlands was a consequence of her personal choice to continue to remain there. She had met with several refusals of her applications for a Netherlands residence permit but had nevertheless opted each time to file a fresh request, thus accepting the risk that, at some point in time, she would have to leave the Netherlands, at least, temporarily. The Minister further considered that the applicant had been born and raised in Suriname where she had resided most of her life and, given her age, she should be regarded as capable of returning to and fending for herself in Suriname, if need be with financial and/or material support from the Netherlands, pending the determination of an application for a provisional residence visa to be filed by her in Suriname. The Minister concluded on this point that the case disclosed no circumstances warranting a finding that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted exceptional hardship within the meaning of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree 2000.', '31.  On 17 May 2010, the applicant filed an objection against this decision with the Minister. She filed additional grounds for her objection and furnished further information by letters of 20 and 25 May and 8 June 2010.', '32.  On 2 July 2010, the applicant requested the Regional Court of The Hague to issue a provisional measure (injunction on expulsion pending the outcome of the objection proceedings).', '33.  On 3 August 2010, following a court hearing held on 28 July 2010 and having regard to pending proceedings taken by the applicant seeking deferral of her removal under section 64 of the Aliens Act 2000 (see paragraph 53 below), the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam rejected the request for a provisional measure on the basis that it was moot.', '34.  On 19 December 2011 the Minister rejected the applicant’s objection of 17 May 2010. An appeal by the applicant against that decision was rejected on 17 July 2012 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Dordrecht. In so far as relevant, its judgment reads:\\n“2.4.1.  It must be examined whether the defendant could have refused to exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa, as required under section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, on the ground that removal is not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. 2.4.2.  It is not in dispute between the parties that there is family life between the appellant and her husband and their three minor children. Refusing the application [for a residence permit] does not constitute interference within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. No residence permit which actually enabled the appellant to enjoy family life in the Netherlands has been taken away from her. The subsequent question arises whether there exist such facts and circumstances that the right to respect for family life may be said to entail a positive obligation for the defendant to allow the applicant to reside [in the Netherlands]. In making this assessment, a ‘fair balance’ must be found between, on the one hand, the interests of the alien concerned in enjoying family life in the Netherlands and, on the other, the general interest of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy. In this balancing exercise, the defendant has a certain margin of appreciation. 2.4.3.  It was reasonable for the defendant to attach more weight to the general interest of the Netherlands State than to the personal interests of the appellant and her family members. The defendant did not have to accept an obligation to grant the appellant residence in the Netherlands on the basis of Article 8 of the Convention. In this balancing exercise, the defendant was entitled to weigh heavily to the appellant’s disadvantage the fact that she had started family life in the Netherlands when she had not been granted a residence permit for this purpose, and that she had further intensified her family life despite the refusal of her requests for residence. This is not altered by the fact that for a certain period the appellant was lawfully resident while awaiting the outcome of proceedings concerning a request for a residence permit. 2.4.4.  The defendant was entitled to take the position that the consequences of the appellant’s choices were at her own risk. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands [no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006‑I]), where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted, removal will lead to a violation of Article 8 only in the most exceptional circumstances. The appellant has not established that, as regards her and her family, there are such exceptional circumstances. Her reliance on the judgments in Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer and Nunez v. Norway (no. 55597/09, 28 June 2011) fails, as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva and Nunez. In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin. With the removal of the mother, contact with the children would become impossible. However, in the appellant’s case, it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there. The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering Suriname. The consequence of her husband’s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the Netherlands to the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and Venezuela during the period between 2 August 2009 and 2 August 2012. This does not mean that it is self-evident that the husband will not be admitted to Suriname. The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to Suriname in another manner. In addition, it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature. 2.4.5.  No other circumstances have appeared on the basis of which the existence of an objective obstacle to continued family life in Suriname must be accepted. There is also no question of excessive formalism. The appellant’s situation is not comparable to the one in the case of Rodrigues da Silva. The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise. The children were all born in the Netherlands and hold Netherlands nationality. At the time the impugned decision was taken, they were respectively eleven, six and one year old. The children have always lived in the Netherlands. Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the Netherlands, the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in Suriname. In this connection it is also relevant that Dutch is spoken in Suriname and that both parents hail from Suriname. 2.4.6.  This is not altered by the fact that the appellant’s husband and children hold Netherlands nationality and, on the basis of Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘TFEU’), can derive rights from their EU citizenship. It can be deduced from the considerations of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ‘ECJ’) in the Dereci et al. judgment of 15 November 2011 (C-256/11), in which a further explanation is given of the Ruiz Zambrano judgment of 8 March 2011 (C-34/09), that in answering the question whether a citizen of the EU who enjoys family life with a third-country national will be denied the right to reside in EU territory flowing directly from Article 20 of the TFEU, only a limited importance is given to the right to respect for family life. As follows from paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Dereci judgment, this right is not, as such, protected by Article 20 of the TFEU but by other international, EU and domestic rules and regulations, such as Article 8 of the Convention, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, EU Directives and section 15 of the Aliens Act 2000. In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the Netherlands or the European Union is, inter alia, also of limited importance. 2.4.7.  The situation of an EU citizen being denied the right to reside in EU territory arises only when the EU citizen is so dependent on the third-country national that, as a consequence of the decision by the defendant, he has no other choice than to stay with that national outside EU territory. In the appellant’s case, that has not occurred. The appellant’s children can be cared for by their father. The father also has Netherlands nationality. The appellant’s husband and children are not obliged or actually compelled to go with her to Suriname in connection with the application for a provisional residence visa. Their rights as EU citizens are thus not breached. 2.4.8.  It was reasonable for the defendant to take the view that there was no appearance of very special individual circumstances leading to undue hardship. The proceedings concerning the appellant’s previous requests for a residence permit and the course of events during her placement in aliens’ detention for removal purposes cannot be regarded as such. The lawfulness of the decisions taken in those proceedings cannot be examined in the present appeal proceedings. The appellant has further not substantiated her claim that, when she submitted her first request for a residence permit, she complied with all the requirements and that she should then have been granted a residence permit. ...”\\nThe Regional Court went on to find that the applicant had not substantiated her alleged medical problems or why these problems should lead to exempting her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. The court further found that the applicant had not demonstrated her claim that, apart from the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, she met all requirements for the issuance of a residence permit.', '35.  On 14 August 2012, the applicant filed a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. No further information about the proceedings on this latest request for a residence permit has been submitted by the parties.', '36.  On 5 January 2007, the aliens’ police ordered the applicant to report to them on 10 January 2007 so that she could be served with notice to leave the country within two weeks. This order was withdrawn owing to the applicant’s third request for a residence permit filed on 23 January 2007 (see paragraph 19 above).', '37.  On 26 February 2010, the applicant’s lawyer was informed by the aliens’ police that – as the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 8 December 2009 (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) did not have suspensive effect – they would proceed with the applicant’s removal.', '38.  On 10 April 2010, having failed to respond to a summons of 4 March 2010 to report to the aliens’ police, the applicant was placed in aliens’ detention (vreemdelingenbewaring) for removal purposes in accordance with section 59 § 1 (a) of the Aliens Act 2000. She was taken to the Zeist detention centre where she was found to be pregnant, her due date being 14 December 2010.', '39.  The applicant’s three successive release requests were rejected by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Rotterdam on 27 April, 1 June and 8 July 2010, respectively. In each decision, the Regional Court found that there were sufficient prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time frame and that the Netherlands authorities were pursuing the applicant’s removal with sufficient diligence. In its rulings, the Regional Court also rejected the applicant’s arguments that her pregnancy rendered her detention contrary to Article 3 and that, against that background, her conditions of detention were incompatible with that provision. In this context, in a letter of 29 June 2010 and addressed to the applicant’s lawyer who submitted it in the proceedings to the Regional Court, the Netherlands section of Amnesty International expressed its concern about the applicant’s placement in aliens’ detention. Although aware that the applicant had failed to respect the duty to report imposed on her, Amnesty International considered that a less severe measure than deprivation of liberty would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the applicant’s case.', '40.  In the course of her placement in aliens’ detention, the applicant, on 28 June, 15 July and 3 August 2010, also filed complaints about her conditions of detention with the competent Supervisory Board (Commissie van Toezicht) of the two detention centres where she was held. These complaints were decided in two decisions given on 12 and 29 November 2010, respectively. Apart from the applicant’s complaint of 28 June 2010 that she had been required to wear restraints during transports to hospital, which was accepted as well-founded in the decision of 29 November 2010, the applicant’s complaints were dismissed. On 6 June 2011 the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Juvenile Protection (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming) gave final decisions on the applicant’s appeals against the decisions of 12 and 29 November 2010. It held that the use of restraints for pregnant women was impermissible. It also held that the applicant had received too little supplementary nutrition upon arrival at the Rotterdam detention centre. These complaints were considered by the Court in its decision on admissibility of 4 December 2012 (see paragraph 4 above) and were declared inadmissible for the reasons set out therein.', '41.  The applicant was released from aliens’ detention on 5 August 2010 and her third child was born on 28 November 2010.', '42.  On 25 September 2012, the Consulate General of Suriname in Amsterdam issued a Surinamese passport to the applicant, which is valid until 25 September 2017.', '43.  Until 1 April 2001, the admission, residence and expulsion of foreign nationals were regulated by the Aliens Act 1965 (Vreemdelingenwet 1965). Further rules were laid down in the Aliens Decree (Vreemdelingenbesluit), the Regulation on Aliens (Voorschrift Vreemdelingen) and the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (Vreemdelingencirculaire). The General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht) applied to proceedings under the Aliens Act 1965, unless indicated otherwise in this Act.', '44.  Under section 4:5 § 1 of the General Administrative Law Act, an administrative authority may decide not to process a petition where the petitioner has failed to comply with any statutory rule for processing the petition or where the information and documents provided are insufficient for assessing the petition, provided that the petitioner has been given the opportunity to complete the petition within a period fixed by the administrative authority concerned.', '45.  Under section 41 § 1 (c) of the Aliens Decree 1965, foreign nationals wishing to reside in the Netherlands for more than three months were required to hold, for admission to the Netherlands, a valid passport containing a valid provisional residence visa issued by a diplomatic or consular mission of the Netherlands in the country of origin or permanent residence, or failing that, the nearest country in which such a mission is established. The purpose of the requirement of this visa was, inter alia, to prevent unauthorised entry and residence in the Netherlands. Failing a provisional residence visa, entry and residence in the Netherlands were contrary to the provisions of the Aliens Act 1965. However, lack of a provisional residence visa could not lead to a refusal of a residence permit if, at the time of the application, all the other conditions had been met.', '46.  On 1 April 2001, the Aliens Act 1965 was replaced by the Aliens Act 2000. On the same date, the Aliens Decree, the Regulation on Aliens and the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines were replaced by new versions based on the Aliens Act 2000. Unless indicated otherwise in the Aliens Act 2000, the General Administrative Law Act continued to apply to proceedings on requests by aliens for admission and residence.', '47.  According to the transitional rules, set out in section 11 of the Aliens Act 2000, an application for a residence permit which was being processed at the time this Act entered into force was to be considered as an application under the provisions of the Aliens Act 2000. Because no transitional rules were laid down for the substantive provisions of the aliens’ law, the substantive provisions of the Aliens Act 2000 took effect immediately.', '48.  Section 1 (h) of the Aliens Act 2000, as in force at the material time, provided:\\n“In this Act and the provisions based upon it the following expressions shall have the following meanings: ...\\n(h)  provisional residence visa: a visa issued by a Netherlands diplomatic or consular mission in the country of origin or in the country of ordinary residence or by the Office of the Governor of the Netherlands Antilles or by the Office of the Governor of Aruba in those countries, with the prior authorisation of Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, for a stay of longer than three months;”', '49.  Section 8(a), (f), (h) and (j) of the Aliens Act 2000 states:\\n“An alien is lawfully resident in the Netherlands only:\\n(a)  on the ground of a residence permit for a fixed period as referred to in section 14 [of this Act, i.e. a residence permit granted for another purpose than asylum]; ...\\n(c)  on the ground of a residence permit for a fixed period as referred to in section 28 [of the Act; i.e. a residence permit granted for asylum]; ...\\n(f)  pending a decision on an application for the issue of a residence permit as referred to in sections 14 and 28 in circumstances where, by or pursuant to this Act or on the ground of a judicial decision, expulsion of the applicant should not take place until the decision on the application has been given; ...\\n(h)  pending a decision on a notice of objection, review or appeal, in circumstances where, by or pursuant to this Act or on the grounds of a judicial decision, expulsion of the applicant should not take place until the decision on the notice of objection or notice of appeal has been given; ...\\n(j)  if there are obstacles to the expulsion as referred to in section 64; ...”', '50.  Section 16 § 1(a) of the Aliens Act 2000 reads:\\n“1.  An application for the issue of a residence permit for a fixed period as referred to in section 14 may be rejected if:\\n(a)  the alien does not possess a valid provisional residence visa which corresponds to the purpose of the residence for which application has been made for a residence permit;”', '51.  Section 27 of the Aliens Act 2000 provides, in its relevant part, as follows:\\n“1.  The consequences of a decision rejecting an application for the issue of a residence permit for a fixed period as referred to in section 14 or a residence permit for an indefinite period as referred to in section 20 shall be, by operation of law, that:\\n(a)  the alien is no longer lawfully resident, unless another legal ground for lawful residence exists;\\n(b)  the alien should leave the Netherlands of his own volition within the time limit prescribed in section 62, failing which the alien may be expelled, and\\n(c)  the aliens supervision officers are authorised, after the expiry of the time limit within which the alien must leave the Netherlands of his own volition, to enter every place, including a dwelling, without the consent of the occupant, in order to expel the alien. 2.  Paragraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis if:\\n(a)  it has been decided under section 24 or under section 4:5 of the General Administrative Law Act that the application will not be processed; ...”', '52.  Section 62 § 1 of the Aliens Act 2000 reads:\\n“After the lawful residence of an alien has ended, he must leave the Netherlands of his own volition within four weeks.”', '53.  Section 64 of the Aliens Act 2000 provides:\\n“An alien shall not be expelled as long as his health or that of any of the members of his family would make it inadvisable for him to travel.”', '54.  Section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000 reads:\\n“The application for a fixed-term residence permit, as referred to in section 14 of the Act shall be rejected if the alien does not hold a valid provisional residence visa.”', '55.  According to section 3.1 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, a foreign national who has made an application for a residence permit is not to be expelled, unless that application, according to the Minister, merely repeats an earlier application.', '56.  Under the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000, the obligation for a foreign national to obtain a provisional residence visa allows the Netherlands authorities to check that the foreign applicant meets all the conditions for the grant of that visa prior to his or her entry into national territory. The power to grant a provisional residence visa is vested in the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs. An application for a provisional residence visa is, in principle, assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit. Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may the holder travel to the Netherlands and apply for a Netherlands residence permit. In the absence of a provisional residence visa, an alien’s entry into and residence in the Netherlands are unlawful.', '57.  The Netherlands Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the Netherlands. Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of directly applicable international agreements, or if their presence serves an essential Dutch interest, or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature (section 13 of the Aliens Act 2000). Respect for family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention constitutes an obligation under an international agreement.', '58.  The admission policy for family formation (gezinsvorming) and family reunification (gezinshereniging) purposes is laid down in Chapter B1 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000. A partner or spouse of a Netherlands national is, in principle, eligible for admission, if certain further conditions relating to matters, such as, public policy and means of subsistence are met.', '59.  Pursuant to section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, a petition for a residence permit for the purpose of family formation shall be rejected if the foreign petitioner does not hold a valid provisional residence visa. A number of categories of aliens is exempted from the requirement to hold a valid provisional residence visa (section 17 § 1 of the Aliens Act 2000 in conjunction with section 3.71 § 2 of the Aliens Decree 2000), one of these categories being aliens whose removal is contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. In addition, under section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree 2000, the competent Minister may decide not to apply the first paragraph of that provision if it is considered that its application will result in exceptional hardship (onbillijkheid van overwegende aard). Chapter B1/2.2.1 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000 sets out the policy on the application of the hardship clause.', '60.  Pursuant to Chapter A4/7.6 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000, pregnant women are not expelled by aircraft within the six weeks prior to delivery. The same provision applies to any woman in the first six weeks after having given birth. Outside this period, pregnancy – in the absence of medical complications – is not a reason for postponing expulsion.', '61.  According to section 6:83 of Book 1 of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), as in force when the applicant married Mr W. on 25 June 1999, cohabitation of spouses was in principle obligatory. This provision was removed from the Civil Code by the Act of 31 May 2001 amending the rights and obligations of spouses and registered partners. This Act entered into force on 22 June 2001.', '62.  Formerly a country (land) within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Suriname became an independent republic on 25 November 1975. The Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname concerning the assignment of nationality of 25 November 1975, Tractatenblad (Netherlands Treaty Series) 1975, no. 132, [1976] 997 United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS) no. 14598, as amended by the Protocol of 14 November 1994, Tractatenblad 1994, no. 280, in its relevant parts, provides as follows:\\n“Article 2 2.  The acquisition of Netherlands nationality pursuant to this Agreement shall entail the loss of Surinamese nationality.\\nArticle 3\\nAll Netherlands nationals of full age who were born in Suriname and whose domicile or place of actual residence is in Suriname on the date of the entry into force of this Agreement shall acquire Surinamese nationality. ...”', '63.  The following information was taken from the Internet web pages of the Surinamese Ministry of Police and Justice (Ministerie van Politie en Justitie), Department of Aliens’ Affairs (Hoofdafdeling Vreemdelingenzaken) and the Surinamese Consulate General in Amsterdam. Aliens subject to visa requirements (visumplichtige vreemdelingen) may enter Suriname on a tourist visa for up to ninety days. If they wish to remain in Suriname for longer, they must first obtain a short-residence visa (machtiging voor kort verblijf, “MKV”) via a Surinamese embassy or consulate in their country of origin. This document enables the alien to request a residence permit after arriving in Suriname.', '64.  The short-residence visa requirement is waived in respect of aliens of Surinamese origin. They may enter Suriname on a tourist’s travel document and request a Surinamese residence permit after their arrival. This category is defined to include, inter alios, the following:\\n-  persons born in Suriname who now have a nationality other than Surinamese;\\n-  persons born outside Suriname to parents one or both of whom was, or were, born in Suriname, those persons having or having had legally recognised family ties (familierechtelijke betrekkingen) with said parent or parents, and who now have a nationality other than Surinamese;\\n-  the spouse and minor children who actually belong to the family of one of the above.', '65.  In addition, a multiple-entry tourist visa valid for three years is available for aliens of Surinamese origin (provided that they have not been refused entry into Suriname during the preceding five years).', '66.  Certain foreign nationals, including Netherlands nationals, may purchase a single-entry “tourist card” which in the case of aliens of Surinamese origin (as defined in paragraph 63 above) is valid for up to six months (ninety days in all other cases). Documents to be submitted are a passport valid for six months or more on arrival, a return ticket and (if applicable) proof of Surinamese origin.', '67.  On 20 December 2013, the National Assembly of Suriname adopted the Act on Persons of Surinamese Origin (Wet Personen van Surinaamse Afkomst), also known as the Diaspora Act. This Act was published in no. 8 of the 2014 Official Gazette (Staatsblad) of Suriname on 21 January 2014 and entered into force three months after publication. This Act defines a “person of Surinamese origin” as someone who does not hold Surinamese nationality but who is born in Suriname or who has at least one parent or two grandparents hailing from Suriname. Under section 9 of this Act, a person holding the status of “person of Surinamese origin” as defined in this Act has the right to enter Suriname freely and to settle and work there, and the visa requirements that apply to foreign nationals in these areas are waived for a “person of Surinamese origin”.', '68.  Dutch is the sole official language of Suriname and thus used by government and administration. It is taught in public education. It is also widely spoken in addition to the traditional languages of particular ethnic groups.', '69.  The applicable rules for family reunification under European Union (“EU”) law differ depending on the status of the person receiving the alien for family reunification purposes. There are three main categories:\\nThis situation is covered by Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification.\\nThis situation falls within the scope of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.\\nThis category falls, in principle, within the remit of Member States and outside the scope of Directives 2003/86 and 2004/38, unless a refusal to admit the TCN would deprive the “static” EU citizen concerned of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen (see paragraphs 71-72 below).', '70.  Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) reads as follows:\\n“1.  Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship. 2.  Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject to the duties provided for in the Treaties. They shall have, inter alia:\\n(a)  the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States;\\n(b)  the right to vote and to stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in their Member State of residence, under the same conditions as nationals of that State;\\n(c)  the right to enjoy, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which they are nationals is not represented, the protection of the diplomatic and consular authorities of any Member State on the same conditions as the nationals of that State;\\n(d)  the right to petition the European Parliament, to apply to the European Ombudsman, and to address the institutions and advisory bodies of the Union in any of the Treaty languages and to obtain a reply in the same language.\\nThese rights shall be exercised in accordance with the conditions and limits defined by the Treaties and by the measures adopted thereunder.”', '71.  On 8 March 2011 the Court of Justice of the European Union gave its ruling in Case C‑34/09, Gerardo Ruiz Zambrano v. Office national de l’emploi (ONEm), which concerned the right of two Columbian nationals, Mr Ruiz Zambrano and his wife, to reside in Belgium on account of the Belgian nationality of their two minor children who had acquired such nationality due to the fact that they were born in Belgium during a period when their parents had been granted humanitarian protection allowing them to reside in Belgium. However, the parents then lost their protective status in Belgium. In this case, the Court of Justice held as follows:\\n“Article 20 [of the TFEU] is to be interpreted as meaning that it precludes a Member State from refusing a third country national upon whom his minor children, who are European Union citizens, are dependent, a right of residence in the Member State of residence and nationality of those children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that third country national, in so far as such decisions deprive those children of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen.”', '72.  In its judgment of 15 November 2011 in Case 256/11, Dereci and Others v. Bundesministerium für Inneres, the Court of Justice examined, inter alia, the question whether Article 20 of the TFEU was to be interpreted as prohibiting a Member State from refusing to grant a right of residence to a national of a non-member country who wished to live with their spouse and minor children, who were European Union citizens resident in Austria and nationals of that Member State, whilst the spouse and children had never exercised their EU right to free movement and were not maintained by the national of a non-member country. It held as follows:\\n“64  ... the Court has held that Article 20 [of the TFEU] precludes national measures which have the effect of depriving Union citizens of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of that status (see Ruiz Zambrano, paragraph 42).\\n65  Indeed, in the case leading to that judgment, the question arose as to whether a refusal to grant a right of residence to a third country national with dependent minor children in the Member State where those children are nationals and reside and a refusal to grant such a person a work permit would have such an effect. The Court considered in particular that such a refusal would lead to a situation where those children, who are citizens of the Union, would have to leave the territory of the Union in order to accompany their parents. In those circumstances, those citizens of the Union would, in fact, be unable to exercise the substance of the rights conferred on them by virtue of their status as citizens of the Union (see Ruiz Zambrano, paragraphs 43 and 44).\\n66  It follows that the criterion relating to the denial of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of European Union citizen status refers to situations in which the Union citizen has, in fact, to leave not only the territory of the Member State of which he is a national but also the territory of the Union as a whole.\\n67  That criterion is specific in character inasmuch as it relates to situations in which, although subordinate legislation on the right of residence of third country nationals is not applicable, a right of residence may not, exceptionally, be refused to a third country national, who is a family member of a Member State national, as the effectiveness of Union citizenship enjoyed by that national would otherwise be undermined.\\n68  Consequently, the mere fact that it might appear desirable to a national of a Member State, for economic reasons or in order to keep his family together in the territory of the Union, for the members of his family who do not have the nationality of a Member State to be able to reside with him in the territory of the Union, is not sufficient in itself to support the view that the Union citizen will be forced to leave Union territory if such a right is not granted.\\n69  That finding is, admittedly, without prejudice to the question whether, on the basis of other criteria, inter alia, by virtue of the right to the protection of family life, a right of residence cannot be refused. However, that question must be tackled in the framework of the provisions on the protection of fundamental rights which are applicable in each case.”', '73.  The relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (“CRC”), signed in New York on 20 November 1989, read as follows:\\nPreamble\\n“The States Parties to the present Convention, ...\\nConvinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community,\\nRecognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, ...\\nHave agreed as follows: ...\\nArticle 3 1.  In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. 2.  States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures. 3.  States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision.\\nArticle 6 ... 1.  States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. ...\\nArticle 12 1.  States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. 2.  For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.\\nArticle 18 1.  States Parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child. The best interests of the child will be their basic concern. ...\\n \\nArticle 27 1.  States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. 2.  The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child’s development. 3.  States Parties, in accordance with national conditions and within their means, shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right ...”', '74.  In its General Comment No. 7 (2005) on Implementing child rights in early childhood, the Committee on the Rights of the Child – the body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the CRC by its State Parties – wished to encourage recognition by States Parties that young children are holders of all rights enshrined in the said Convention and that early childhood is a critical period for the realisation of these rights. The best interests of the child are examined, in particular, in section 13, which provides as follows:\\n“13.  Best interests of the child. Article 3 [of the CRC] sets out the principle that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children. By virtue of their relative immaturity, young children are reliant on responsible authorities to assess and represent their rights and best interests in relation to decisions and actions that affect their well-being, while taking account of their views and evolving capacities. The principle of best interests appears repeatedly within the Convention (including in articles 9, 18, 20 and 21, which are most relevant to early childhood). The principle of best interests applies to all actions concerning children and requires active measures to protect their rights and promote their survival, growth, and well-being, as well as measures to support and assist parents and others who have day-to-day responsibility for realizing children’s rights:\\n(a)  Best interests of individual children. All decision-making concerning a child’s care, health, education, etc. must take account of the best interests principle, including decisions by parents, professionals and others responsible for children.\\nStates parties are urged to make provisions for young children to be represented independently in all legal proceedings by someone who acts for the child’s interests, and for children to be heard in all cases where they are capable of expressing their opinions or preferences; ...”', '75.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '5.  On 21 May 2004 at 08.15 two household workers (“M.R.” and “I.B”) discovered the body of the applicant’s daughter (“S.J.”) at her home in Ventspils. She had a rope around her neck, the other end of which was thrown over the top of a door and tied to the door handle on the other side.', '6.  At 08.20 M.R. and I.B. reported the incident to the Ventspils City and District Police Department of the State Police (“the Ventspils State Police”). Three police officers from the Ventspils State Police were dispatched to S.J.’s home. S.J.’s husband (“A.J.”), who worked as a policeman-driver for the Ventspils State Police, arrived separately.', '7.  The Government have provided details of the investigation which followed. Their account has not been disputed by the applicant.', '8.  From 09.40 to 10.35 officers G.A. and A.G. from the Ventspils State Police examined S.J.’s home. They prepared the procedural record, photographed the scene and seized material evidence. Later that same day S.J.’s body was transported to the Ventspils City Morgue and A.G. requested an autopsy and forensic medical examination of the body. He also submitted an internal report to the Head of the Ventspils State Police which stated that he and G.A. had arrived at the scene, established that S.J. was dead, arranged for the transportation of the body, examined the scene, and took statements. In the report he noted that the persons transporting S.J.’s body to the morgue had removed the rope from around her neck.', '9.  In a letter dated 23 May 2005 a Prosecutor from the General Prosecutor’s Office admitted to the applicant that the examination of the scene by A.G. had not been done “qualitatively” or in compliance with the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Law. He had been subjected to disciplinary action and prosecuted under Article 319(1) of the Criminal Law (Failure of a State Official to Perform His Duties) and under Article 327(19) (Forgery of a Document by a State Official). The second prosecution would appear to relate to the forgery of a Doctor’s signature on a document purporting to set out an expert’s conclusion. A.G. was later released from criminal liability.', '10.  In the same letter the Prosecutor from the General Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that another officer from the Ventspils State Police (“A.M.”) had been subjected to disciplinary action for violating the Criminal Procedure Law when verifying the fact of S.J.’s death. It is not clear whether or not the disciplinary action related to the examination of the scene on 21 May 2004.', '11.  On 24 May 2004 the police took statements from the applicant and S.J.’s sister (“B.L.”), both of whom expressed the opinion that S.J. had no reason to commit suicide.', '12.  On 25 May 2004 a forensic expert, having examined S.J.’s body, concluded that she had died on 21 May 2004 and attributed the cause of death to mechanical asphyxiation. The report stated that there was no evident sign of violence, aside from the strangulation, although it noted that S.J. had bruises on her shoulder, hands and legs and three scratches on her right palm which could have been acquired up to three days prior to her death.', '13.  The following day the police obtained statements from a neighbour (“M.N.”) and two of S.J.’s colleagues. M.N. recalled that between 22.00 and 22.15 on 20 May 2004 she had observed a red vehicle similar to the one driven by A.J. parked in the courtyard of the building where S.J. and A.J. lived. Another neighbour (“Ma.N.”) subsequently recalled seeing such a vehicle in the courtyard from 22.00 to 22.30.', '14.  S.J.’s colleagues confirmed that she had finished her shift in the shop she worked in at 22.00 and headed to an office where she had a second job as a cleaner. Another witness later confirmed that she had arrived at the office at 22.15 and left at 22.45 ‑ 22.50.', '15.  The Government submitted that on 27 May 2004 the Kurzeme Regional Division of the Organised Crime Combating Department (“the OCCD”) requested a list of incoming and outgoing calls to S.J.’s mobile phone from her operator.', '16.  On 30 May 2004 the son of S.J. and A.J. (“Av.J.”) made a statement. He said that A.J. had picked him up at home at 18.00 on 20 May 2004. He had remained with his father until 23.00, when his father returned to work and he went to the home of his sister (“D.J.”). A colleague of A.J. later reported going with him to the cafeteria in the police station at 23.00 and the chief officer on duty that night confirmed that A.J. had remained with the squad until his shift ended at 07.00 on 21 May 2004. He also told the investigators that after midnight the police station was locked and the main gate closed, with the consequence that no person – or vehicle – could leave the premises without his permission.', '17.  On 1 June 2004 Officer A.M. performed a further examination of S.J.’s home. He examined marks and traces left by the rope on the door and seized several samples for forensic traceology examination.', '18.  On 8 July 2004 a household worker gave a statement to the police confirming that on 20 May 2004 A.J. had returned home at 18.00 to collect Av.J. On 20 July 2004 D.J. confirmed that A.J. and Av.J. had arrived at her home at 23.00 that night.', '19.  On 21 July 2004 the State Forensic Expertise Centre reported that the groove marks on the upper fragment of the door had been chafed into the wooden surface by the rope attached to S.J.’s neck. Those marks could only have been made by pulling the weight of S.J.’s body towards the door handle, to which the rope was subsequently tied.', '20.  On 23 July 2004 the OCCD initiated criminal proceedings to investigate the aggravated murder (murder with mercenary intent) of S.J. From this point onwards, Inspector V.L. of the OCCD was responsible for the investigation under the supervision of the General Prosecutor’s Office. A.L. was the Prosecutor in charge and he reported to A.B., who was the supervising Prosecutor.', '21.  On 23 July 2004 A.J. was interrogated as a suspect and he was informed that he could not change his registered place of domicile. Av.J., D.J. and B.L. were questioned as witnesses.', '22.  A couple of days later, M.N. and Ma.N. were again interviewed about the red vehicle parked in the courtyard of S.J.’s home. Both indicated that they had believed the vehicle to be the one driven by A.J.', '23.  Throughout the following months witnesses were interviewed, including A.J. (who was questioned repeatedly), his relatives and acquaintances, S.J.’s relatives (including the applicant), the couple’s neighbours, a number of police officers, S.J.’s employer and some of her colleagues, her household workers and her dentist. The General Prosecutor’s Office also instructed the OCCD to order further forensic tests, although records indicate that many were in fact ordered by the Ventspils State Police.', '24.  Attempts were made to establish the exact time of death but on 11 August 2004 the forensic expert indicated that “considering that the forensic medical examination of S.J.’s body had been performed four days after it was found and that livor mortis appears within the first hour of death, a more precise time of death could not be established”.', '25.  A.J.’s uniform and the seat covers of his service car were seized on 9 August 2004 and DNA samples were taken from him. On 9 September 2004 the expert reported that there were several different DNA samples on the rope used to hang S.J. but none belonged to A.J. The expert was unable to establish the gender identification of the samples. On 16 September 2004 an expert concluded that some fibres found on S.J.’s coat possibly came from A.J.’s car seat but the results were inconclusive.', '26.  Further tests were also carried out on S.J.’s body, but no injuries were found which would indicate a struggle or self-defence.', '27.  Furthermore, S.J.’s bank records were requested, as were details of all red vehicles matching the description of the one seen at the scene of the crime. S.J.’s family members were also questioned repeatedly about whether or not she had kept a personal diary. On 23 March 2005 the diary appears to have been handed over to the police and attached to the criminal file.', '28.  On 1 December 2006 a further forensic traceology report suggested that there was a “high probability” that if S.J. had committed suicide the grooves on the top of the door would not have appeared as they did.', '29.  On 21 March 2007 A.J. was again declared a suspect. Further DNA tests were performed on the rope and experiments were carried out to determine the driving time from Ventspils Police Station to S.J.’s home. The results of the latter test appeared to confirm A.J.’s alibi and on 13 November 2008 the decision to once again declare him a suspect was quashed.', '30.  On 11 January 2011 a new OCCD investigator (“A.Jo.) assumed jurisdiction over the case file.', '31.  On 20 August 2007 the OCCD acknowledged D.J. (the applicant’s granddaughter) as a victim in the criminal proceedings.', '32.  On 26 May 2004 the applicant wrote to the Head of the OCCD alleging that S.J. had been murdered. The OCCD informed the applicant on 2 July 2004 that the circumstances of S.J.’s death were still being investigated.', '33.  The applicant subsequently submitted further complaints to the Prosecutor’s Office concerning the conduct of the investigation. In the course of these complaints, he implied that A.J. was directly or indirectly implicated in S.J.’s murder and that his colleagues on the police force were deliberately obstructing the investigation.', '34.  On 22 December 2004 A.Mi., a senior Prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Kurzeme Regional Court, informed the applicant that an in-depth investigation was being carried out. It was being conducted in an impartial manner and there was no evidence of any deliberate obstruction by the police. A.Mi. noted that the investigation was complicated and was supervised by another prosecutor from the same office (“A.L.”).', '35.  On 23 May 2005 a Prosecutor from the General Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that the investigation was still ongoing and that the evidence which had been gathered was not sufficient to bring charges against any specific persons. The Prosecutor admitted that A.G. had not carried out the initial examination of the scene of S.J.’s death “qualitatively”, that both A.G. and A.M. had violated the requirements of the laws on criminal procedure and that the two officers had received disciplinary penalties. In addition, criminal proceedings had been initiated against A.G. for criminal inaction of a State official (section 319 of the Criminal Law) and for the forgery of official documents (section 327 of the Criminal Law). However, on 14 March 2005 the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Kurzeme Regional Court had decided to release A.G. from criminal liability pursuant to Article 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '36.  On 17 July 2007 the applicant wrote to A.L., the supervising Prosecutor, and asked to see certain expert reports and other specific information concerning the investigation into S.J.’s death. More particularly, he asked for additional information concerning the violations committed by the police officers A.M. and A.G. He also enquired when the case would be sent to a court.', '37.  On 20 August 2007 the Prosecutor replied to the applicant. He informed him that the pre-trial investigation was still ongoing and a forensic biological analysis of DNA was being carried out. Further investigative steps would be planned after receiving the results of that analysis and it was therefore impossible to predict the date of the completion of the pre-trial investigation. The applicant was further informed that under the Law of Criminal Procedure he had no right to read the case file or to receive copies thereof. The only persons who had such a right were the accused and the victims, but only after the completion of the criminal proceedings. With regard to the violations committed by the police officers, the applicant was advised to contact the Ventspils State Police.', '38.  On 10 September 2007 the applicant submitted a complaint to the Prosecutor General concerning the Prosecutors’ responses of, inter alia, 22 December 2004, 23 May 2005 and 20 August 2007. He principally complained that the investigation was being deliberately delayed in order to protect S.J.’s murderer(s).', '39.  The applicant’s complaint was forwarded to the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Kurzeme Regional Court. On 1 October 2007 he received a response from A.Mi. informing him that the investigation and the gathering of evidence were continuing “in order to establish important facts”. Unspecified expert reports had apparently been ordered and their results were expected no earlier than December. Finally, the applicant was informed that his “allegation that the investigator and the supervising Prosecutor were not sufficiently active and were uninterested in establishing the truth were unfounded”.', '40.  On 26 October 2007 the applicant submitted a further complaint to the Prosecutor General. He criticised the Office of the General Prosecutor’s decision to forward his complaint to the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Kurzeme Regional Court. He also denounced the response of 1 October 2007 as “passive and unfounded” and considered that the fact that it did not address the substance of his complaints demonstrated that A.Mi. was not interested in establishing the truth about S.J.’s murder.', '41.  On 13 November 2007 the Prosecutor General gave a final response to the applicant’s complaint. In the relevant parts of the response the applicant was informed:\\n“... [the senior prosecutor A.M.] in his response of 1 October [2007] informed you that the investigation of the criminal case ... was ongoing, that expert reports had been ordered, and that after receiving expert reports further investigative steps would be planned. While criminal proceedings are pending, the materials in the criminal case file are an investigative secret (section 375 of the Law of Criminal Procedure), which is why it is impossible to give you more specific information concerning the investigative steps that have been taken and will be taken. It might be for that reason that you have formed an incorrect opinion that the investigation is being intentionally delayed and not conducted with the aim of establishing the culprit; however, such an opinion does not find support in the steps actually taken in the criminal proceedings.\\nIn the course of the pre-trial investigation of the criminal case ... a sufficient amount of investigative steps were carried out: more than 15 expert reports were ordered and received and the need to order [additional] expert reports and the planning of further investigative steps was determined by the [findings of the] expert reports already received. In addition, the preparation of expert reports took significant time; more than 40 witnesses were questioned and other investigative steps carried out.

The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Chișinău.', '6.  The applicant lived with her four-year-old daughter, A., and with her mother, G.', '7.  Following a call from C.I., on 22 September 2011 the police removed A. from her home and placed her in the care of the Municipal Children’s Hospital “V. Ignatenco”. A medical report drawn up on the same day found that the applicant had severe alcohol intoxication.', '8.  C.I. later stated to the police that, as a salesman in a shop on a street near the applicant’s house, he would regularly see the applicant and her mother drinking alcohol and failing to take care of A., who often had an unkempt appearance and would wander around without adult surveillance, asking for food. He called the police on the evening of 22 September 2011 after A. had asked him to call for an ambulance because her mother and grandmother had been fighting.', '9.  On an unspecified date the Ciocana Police Office reported to the Ciocana Child Protection Service the circumstances of their intervention on 22 September 2011:\\n“On 22 September around 8.45 p.m. [a call] was registered about domestic violence occurring at [the applicant’s address]. At the scene [the applicant and her mother], both visibly drunk, were found exhibiting aggressive behaviour and were unkempt in their appearance. Physical and psychological violence was exercised in the presence of the child.\\nA child was found in the yard ... she looked unkempt and said that she had not eaten anything the whole day.\\nFrom discussions with the neighbour who had called the police, it was established that the child had been without surveillance for a week, in an unkempt state and sometimes asking for food. Subsequently the child was identified as A.\\nAt the scene it was also established that the child lives in unsanitary conditions, without electricity. The child does not have the basic requirements for her physical and intellectual development, and is not enrolled in any pre-school institution. ... [S]he does not have a healthy diet [because she] begs food from neighbours.\\n...[The applicant] was directed to undergo an examination in order to assess the level and the nature of her intoxication.\\n...On 22 September 2011 the child inspector who was present at the scene called for an ambulance which took the child to [hospital] for medical investigation and appropriate medical assistance ....\\nThe Ciocana Police Office is currently investigating whether [the applicant] had committed an offence under Article 63 (2) of the Code of Administrative Offences. ...\\n[We request] ... adoption of a decision on the placement of the child in a special institution and the lodging of an action in court seeking withdrawal of [the applicant’s] parental authority”.', '10.  On 23 September 2011 a social worker and a psychologist from a non-governmental organisation visited the applicant’s home and found that the house was in disorder and lacked running water, electricity and gas.', '11.  On 27 September 2011 the applicant was interviewed by a Ciocana police officer. On the same day a police report concluded that the applicant was failing to duly fulfil her parental duties of educating and caring for her child because her abuse of alcohol, quarrelling or fighting with her mother in the child’s presence, and at times using physical violence towards her mother. The report concluded that the applicant had committed an offence under Article 63 (1) of the Code of Administrative Offences and took into account the applicant’s personal and family circumstances as a mitigating factor. On 19 October 2011 the Ciocana prosecutor confirmed the police’s finding that the applicant had committed an offence under Article 63 (1) of the Code of Administrative Offences and sentenced her to an administrative fine in the amount of 200 Moldovan lei (MDL) (equivalent to 12.5 euros (EUR)).', '12.  Also on 27 September 2011, the Ciocana Child Protection Committee examined A.’s situation. When the applicant appeared before the committee she was allegedly intoxicated. The applicant disputed that allegation. Based on the findings of this meeting, on 28 September 2011 the Ciocana Child Protection Committee concluded that A.’s return to her biological family would put her life and health in danger. The Committee decided to place her in the Municipal Children’s Centre and to initiate proceedings to withdraw the applicant’s parental authority.', '13.  A. stayed in hospital from 22 to 30 September 2011. She was diagnosed with “residual encephalopathy with delayed motor skills, mild leg movement disorder, thyroid gland disease, decreased need for sleep (“hyposomnia”), urinary insufficiency and disorder of the function of the pancreas.” She was prescribed treatment.', '14.  On 30 September 2011 A. was transferred to the Municipal Children’s Centre. A psychological evaluation dated 14 February 2012 described A. as displaying “well-developed gross motor skills, corresponding to her age, at a slow tempo. Free, balanced and directional walking. Weak fine motor skills. ... Balanced and quiet behaviour, delayed development of cognitive processes and of communication abilities, with chances of recovery. Psycho-social deprivation.”', '15.  On 20 December 2012 the Municipal Child Protection Service approved A.’s placement with the family of C., a professional parental social worker. On 22 January 2013 C. took A. from the Municipal Children’s Centre and noted that A. was physically healthy, clean and without any skin eruptions.', '16.  On 29 September 2011 the Ciocana Child Protection Service instituted proceedings seeking the withdrawal of the applicant’s parental authority. They relied on four grounds for the withdrawal of authority under Article 67 of the Family Code: neglect of a child, a parent’s immoral conduct, a parent’s chronic alcoholism, and other reasons taking into account the interests of the child. They relied on the information provided by the police (see paragraphs 8-11 above) and the conclusions of the committee meeting of 27 September 2011 (see paragraph 12 above).', '17.  In a note dated 7 November 2011 the Municipal Children’s Centre informed the Ciocana District Court that on 30 September 2011 A. had been transferred to the centre and that on 7 October 2011 she had been registered as a child in difficult circumstances. The note also stated that the applicant had neither visited nor inquired about A. since her placement in the centre.', '18.  In the course of the proceedings, the Ciocana Child Protection Service submitted the applicant’s character assessment drawn up by the Ciocana Police Office on an unspecified date, which read:\\n“...[The applicant’s] family has been classified as a family unfit to educate (“needucogenă”) since 26 September 2011. It was found that [the applicant] drank alcohol at home with her mother, followed by violent behaviour in the child’s presence. Before the child’s placement in the centre, she was often seen without any parental surveillance and looked unkempt. The child did not attend any pre-school institution. [The applicant’s] family does not have electricity, water or gas in their house.”', '19.  It also submitted a letter dated 2 November 2011 in which the Ciocana polyclinic stated that A. was registered with that medical institution and that “P.E. (the applicant’s first name is N.), the child’s mother, abused alcohol, and did not look after the child’s health; a neighbour accompanied the child on medical visits.”', '20.  At the hearing on 24 January 2012 the representative of the Ciocana Child Protection Service submitted that during the visit to the applicant’s home on 23 September 2011 the applicant and G. had been intoxicated and displayed signs of physical violence. The applicant had been behaving inappropriately and had an unkempt appearance. The neighbours reported that A. was not attending any pre-school institution, was generally neglected by her family, was usually dirty, and often asked for food. She also alleged that the applicant had been intoxicated when she appeared before the Child Protection Committee at the meeting on 27 September 2011.', '21.  In court the applicant argued that she was a single parent and was receiving no support from anyone, including social services. She had financial difficulties, which prevented her from improving her living conditions, which were very basic. She explained that they used wood for heating and that the electricity had been cut off six months previously after an electrical accident. She contended that she cared for her child, supplying her with toys, clothes and shoes, and that A. had been provided with medical assistance by a medical institution other than the local polyclinic, submitting a copy of A.’s immunisation record. She stated her wish to be with A. and her commitment to discharge her parental responsibilities. She referred to the letter of 27 October 2011 (see paragraph 31 below) as evidence that she had requested access to her child, but to no avail. She argued that the incident of 22 September 2011 had not been typical and could not constitute grounds for the removal of her parental authority. She submitted that she had left in order to work in Turkey for a period of only two weeks, after which she had returned to unofficial employment in different jobs, and supplied confirmation that after the incident she had found official employment in Moldova. She also supplied confirmation that she had obtained the documents necessary to enrol A. in a pre-school institution. She denied having been intoxicated at the Committee meeting on 27 September 2011 and stated that she consumed alcohol only occasionally.', '22. The court file also contained a statement signed by fifteen persons living in the applicant’s neighbourhood, according to which A. had never been seen wandering around dirty and hungry, or begging.', '23.  The applicant attended the first three hearings. She did not appear in court at the fourth and last hearing.', '24.  On 14 February 2012 the Ciocana District Court decided to withdraw the applicant’s parental authority, relying essentially on the arguments of the Child Protection Service. The court found, inter alia, the following:\\n“The representative of the [Municipal Children’s Centre] submitted that A. had been transferred from the [hospital] and was undergoing treatment for residual encephalopathy with delayed motor skills, mild leg movement disorder, thyroid gland disease, decreased need for sleep (“hyposomnia”), and urinary insufficiency.\\n...[the applicant] lives together with her daughter A. ... in unsanitary conditions. She is unemployed and claims to leave periodically in order to work in Turkey. ... On 22 September 2011... the police found [the applicant] drunk and... quarrelling violently in the presence of A., who was dirty, crying, hungry and scared.\\nAccording to the representative of the [Ciocana Child Protection Service], during her visit [on 23 September 2011] she had found [the applicant] and her mother drunk, aggressive and with an unkempt appearance, the house and the yard disorderly and in a completely unsanitary condition. Citing neighbours, [the representative of the Child Protection service submitted that] A. was neglected by her mother and grandmother, was not enrolled in a pre-school institution, was often seen wandering around dirty and asking for food. ...[The applicant] was drunk at the meeting on 27 September 2011 of the Child Protection Committee. The Committee concluded that the child’s return to the family would put her life and health in danger.\\n... [The applicant] had neither visited nor asked about [A.] since her removal from home, which was evidence of [the applicant’s] indifference towards [A.], and her immoral life style and inappropriate behaviour prove that she is unfit to raise a child.\\nOn 22 September 2011 a medical examination confirmed [the applicant’s] severe alcohol intoxication. ... On 19 October 2011 the Ciocana prosecutor’s office found [the applicant] guilty, under Article 63 (1) of the Code of Administrative Offences, of failing to discharge her parental duties and fined her 200 Moldovan lei (12.5 euros).\\n... [A.’s] psychological assessment reported balanced and quiet behaviour, delayed development of cognitive processes and of communication abilities, introversion, and a positive emotional state.\\n... [The applicant] neglected her parental duties, did not appear in court to object, did not take care of the child, did not provide material or emotional support, and had a negative influence on the child through her immoral conduct.”', '25.  The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that she had been in legitimate employment since 4 October 2011, was making significant efforts to improve her life and wished to be with A. She referred to the evidence in the file that she had repeatedly attempted to visit her daughter but had been allowed to do so on only two occasions. She referred to the statements of a social worker before the court, according to which there had not previously been any reason to remove the child from the family or to withdraw the applicant’s parental authority and no family support measures had been undertaken. The applicant submitted that she had not attended the last hearing due to health problems.', '26.  In the appellate proceedings, the representative of the Ciocana Child Protection Service stated that the applicant had been warned on several occasions that she needed to bring order to her house. She also submitted that A. had described to social services “horrifying” (“de groază”) moments experienced with her mother, entire days spent without eating anything and that she had expressed her wish not to be returned to her mother.', '27.  On 24 October 2012 the Chișinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, reiterating the reasons relied upon by the district court.', '28.  The applicant appealed again, arguing, inter alia, that her rights under Article 8 of the Convention had been violated. She submitted that in 2012, while the proceedings were ongoing, she had cleaned up her house and improved the living conditions. She submitted that she had regularly visited A. at the Municipal Children’s Centre and had brought parcels for her. She denied having been intoxicated at the meeting on 27 September 2011 of the Child Protection Committee and noted that no evidence to support this allegation had been presented. She agreed that, in the light of her difficult material situation, A.’s placement was an appropriate solution if applied in conjunction with measures to provide her with the necessary support, with a view to reuniting the family as soon as possible. She did not agree that the withdrawal of her parental authority was a proportionate measure under Article 8 of the Convention.', '29.  On 8 May 2013 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the previous judgments for identical reasons. That judgment was final.', '30.  The applicant complained to the Ciocana prosecutor’s office about A.’s removal from her home on 22 September 2011. On 7 October 2011 the Ciocana prosecutor’s office informed her that A. had been lawfully removed from home and sent to the hospital for medical examination, given that on 22 September 2011 the Ciocana police officers had found the applicant and her mother intoxicated and aggressive, their house in an unsanitary condition and the child A. hungry and looking unkempt. The applicant was informed that A. had been placed in the Municipal Children’s Centre under the care of the Ciocana Child Protection Service and that proceedings had been instituted on 29 September 2011 to withdraw her parental authority.', '31.  On 27 October 2011 the applicant submitted a request to visit A., stating that she had not been kept informed about A.’s fate and that all her previous verbal enquiries had been refused. On 23 November 2011 the Ciocana Child Protection Service refused the request and informed her that visits were prohibited while court proceedings concerning the withdrawal of her parental authority were pending.', '32.  In a letter dated 17 January 2013 the head of the Municipal Children’s Centre stated that the Ciocana Child Protection Service had placed A. in the care of the centre on 30 September 2011 and had prohibited any visits by the applicant until the end of the court proceedings. The letter confirmed that the applicant had requested visits. Even though her requests had been refused, the applicant had managed to see her child on 1 and 12 August 2012. During the winter holidays, she had brought several parcels with sweets and toys and had asked for further meetings. The applicant had been redirected to the Ciocana Child Protection Service to obtain an authorisation to visit A. before the end of the court proceedings.', '33.  In a letter addressed to the Municipal Child Protection Service dated 22 August 2013, the Ciocana Child Protection Service submitted that it was inappropriate to examine the applicant’s request of 1 August 2013 to visit A. because the applicant’s parental authority had been withdrawn, the child was to be placed under a relative’s guardianship and it was for that guardian to decide on the frequency of contact between A. and her biological mother.', '34.  On 31 October 2013 H., an aunt, was appointed as A.’s guardian and the beneficiary of her child-care allowance. The applicant’s requests to visit A. were refused by H. on the grounds that she no longer had any parental rights.', '35.  Following the applicant’s repeated requests to visit A., on 26 December 2013 the Municipal Child Protection Service allowed visits on Saturdays in the presence of A.’s guardian.', '36.  On 20 February 2014 the applicant gave birth to her second child. Four days later, citing the lack of a home or resources to take care of the child, she declared her consent to the child’s adoption.'], 'applicants': ['N.P.'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['11', '15', '17', '18', '20', '22', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '37', '40', '51']}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'explained_indices': [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 19, 27, 28, 29, 25, 18, 15, 16, 30, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 17, 31], 'explained_distances': [0.5462291, 0.48450106, 0.45002532, 0.42022765, 0.38948232, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226, 0.24124226], 'number_of_sentences': 32, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

To this effect, the police drew up a record, signed by three police officers and two employees (A.A. and V.Q.) of the local housing utilities committee responsible for the residential buildings in question, which stated that the applicant had “laid fresh asphalt in front of the residential buildings indicated on the attached drawing ... and this fact [was] confirmed by the signatures below”.', '8.

While some of the statements were dated 26 October 2005, two statements were dated 27 October 2005.', '9.  In particular, a statement by I.K., dated 26 October 2005 and addressed to Police Office No. 19, read as follows:\\n“I have resided at the above-mentioned address since 1989. During this time, no renovation has been done in the courtyard [of our building]. But in the last month a lot of renovation work has been carried out in the courtyard ... [a description of specific improvements follows].\\nThe above-mentioned works were organised and carried out by our respected neighbour ... Nadir Orujov. He is a person who is willing to share all the problems of the entire neighbourhood and to assist [in resolving these problems]. We wish this person only victory in the upcoming elections”.', '10.  A statement by G.N., dated 27 October 2005 and addressed to Police Office No. 19, read as follows:\\n“In reply to the questions asked of me, I inform you that Nadir Oruj oglu Orujov, who has nominated himself as a candidate [for the parliamentary elections], has carried out benevolent renovation works in our courtyard in the pre-election period. He has laid fresh asphalt in front of the buildings. I have written this statement myself. I confirm [the authenticity of] my signature”.', '11.  A statement by S.A., dated 27 October 2005 and addressed to Police Office No. 19, read as follows:\\n“I inform you that Nadir Oruj oglu Orujov, who has nominated himself as a candidate [for the parliamentary elections], is laying fresh asphalt in front of the buildings [in our courtyard]. He is a good person. I have written this statement myself. I confirm [the authenticity of] my signature.”', '12.  Other statements were of a similar content.', '13.  According to an extract from the minutes of the ConEC meeting held on 28 October 2005, made available to the applicant and later submitted by him to the Court, the ConEC decided as follows:\\n“1. To take into consideration the statements by voters ... 2.  To confirm, based on the statements and other material submitted, breaches of Articles 88.4.4 and 88.4.5 of the Electoral Code by Nadir Oruj oglu Orujov, who is registered as a candidate for the elections to the Milli Majlis. 3.  In accordance with Article 113.2.3 of the Electoral Code, to apply to the Court of Appeal with a request for the cancellation of the applicant’s registration as a candidate owing to the breach of the requirements of Articles 88.4.4 and 88.4.5 of the Electoral Code. ...”', '14.  The full copy of the same minutes of the above ConEC meeting, as submitted by the Government, indicates that this meeting was held on 29 October 2005.', '15.  By a letter of 28 October 2005, the ConEC submitted the cancellation request to the Court of Appeal. The request stated, inter alia:\\n“[C]andidate Nadir Oruj oglu Orujov has breached the requirements of Article 88 of the Electoral Code and thus violated the rights of other candidates. There have been repeated oral submissions to [the ConEC] concerning his illegal actions. Finally, citizens have applied to Police Office no. 19 of the Nasimi District Police Department and requested [the police] to put an end to his illegal actions. ... It has been proved that [the applicant] conducted [certain renovation works], in breach of Articles 88.4.4 and 88.4.5 of the Electoral Code, with the purpose of buying votes. ...”', '16.  According to the applicant, he was not informed about the ConEC’s request in a timely manner.', '17.  The Court of Appeal examined the case the next day, at 11 a.m. on Saturday 29 October 2005.', '18.  According to the record of the court hearing, the court examined the documents submitted by the ConEC and heard a number of witnesses. In particular, two police officers, F. Zamanov and R. Samadov, testified that, according to “residents of the buildings” in question, the applicant had carried out unauthorised urban improvement works in the constituency.', '19.  The court also heard six local residents. It appears that three of them (G.N., R.I. and V.Q.) had submitted handwritten statements to the police earlier. These three witnesses told the court that they did not know the applicant personally and had not known who had carried out the renovation works, that on 26 October 2005 police officer F. Zamanov had approached each of them individually on the street, engaged them in conversation and informed them that the works had been carried out by the applicant, and that F. Zamanov had then asked them to write a “thank-you note” expressing their gratitude to the applicant for his efforts on behalf of the community. The witnesses said that they had not been told that their statements would be used against the applicant later.', '20.  Of the remaining three local residents, one stated that she did not know who had carried out the urban improvement works near her home, and two stated that the works had been carried out by the local residents themselves at their own expense.', '21.  In its judgment of 29 October 2005, consisting of one and a half typed pages, the Court of Appeal summarised the above-mentioned witness statements as follows:\\n“... witnesses F. Zamanov and R. Samadov confirmed that [the renovation works] at [the location in question] had been carried out under the instructions and with the assistance of the candidate for the elections to the Milli Majlis, N.O. Orujov. This circumstance was also confirmed by witnesses [R.I. and G.N.] when questioned at the court hearing. ...\\nWitnesses [V.Q. and M.M.], when questioned at the court hearing, stated that they did not know who had laid the fresh asphalt and carried out the renovation works, while witnesses [Q.H. and G.V.] stated that these renovation works had been carried out by the local residents themselves”.', '22.  The court then directly proceeded to a finding that the applicant, by carrying out renovation works in public areas “with the aim of winning over voters” and “promising to provide assistance to voters in return for their votes”, had attempted to influence the voters’ opinion in a manner prohibited by Article 88.4 of the Electoral Code. The court therefore decided to cancel the applicant’s registration as a candidate.', '23.  On 31 October 2005 the applicant enquired as to the identity of the local residents who had testified against him. He discovered that two of the persons (S.A. and T.T.) who had complained about him to the police did not actually live in his constituency and had used false addresses in their written submissions.', '24.  Three other witnesses (I.K., G.N. and V.Q.) made notarised affidavits addressed to the Supreme Court in which they retracted their previous handwritten submissions to the police, claiming that, in fact, none of them had known whether the renovation works had actually been carried out by the applicant, and that they had been either pressured or tricked by the police into making these statements, without being informed that the police intended to use them against the applicant.', '25.  The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court, arguing that the evidence used against him had been fabricated, that the Court of Appeal had made manifest errors in examining the evidence and had based its decision on unproven allegations, and that therefore his registration had been cancelled arbitrarily. With his cassation appeal, he also enclosed the witness affidavits mentioned above.', '26.  On 3 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 29 October 2005. It refused to admit the new evidence submitted by the applicant challenging the reliability of the original evidence used against him (including the witnesses’ affidavits retracting their previous accusations in respect of the applicant); it noted that the factual circumstances of the case had been duly established by the lower court and that the Supreme Court could examine the case only on points of law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court stated that the lower court had applied the material law correctly and complied with the requirements of procedural law.'], 'applicants': ['ORUJOV'], 'defendants': ['AZERBAIJAN'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['P1-3'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'P1-3': ['19', '20', '21', '24', '42', '47']}, 'silver_rationales': [14, 15, 16, 19], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [14, 15, 16, 19], 'explained_indices': [4, 3, 2, 10, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 21, 20, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 11, 0, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.19435349, 0.155631, 0.13599747, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.039272487, 0.026609063, -0.13220167], 'number_of_sentences': 22, 'article_id': 2, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicants were born in 1947 and 1949 respectively. They are married and had two sons: Lom-Ali Aziyev, born in 1973, and Umar-Ali Aziyev, born in 1974. They all lived in an apartment situated on the second floor of a block of flats at 49 Tukhachevskogo Street, Grozny.', '7.  During the night of 24 September 2000 the applicants and their sons were asleep at home. At around 1.20 a.m. a group of eight armed men wearing camouflage uniforms and masks and carrying torches entered the applicants’ flat, having broken down the door. The men did not identify themselves. The applicants claimed that the men were members of the Russian military, since they spoke Russian and could move around freely in Grozny during the curfew.', '8.  The men kicked the first applicant and beat him with machine guns. They aimed their guns at both applicants and ordered them to be silent.', '9.  Thereafter the men proceeded to the applicants’ sons’ room. Without producing any documents to authorise their actions, the men searched the room and arrested Lom-Ali and Umar-Ali Aziyev. As the applicants’ younger son resisted, he was knocked off his feet, handcuffed and blindfolded. Then the men took away the Aziyev brothers, who only had their underwear on and were barefoot. One of the men also took a pair of shoes and a tape recorder. The second applicant’s attempts to obstruct the detention of her sons failed as the men threatened her with firearms. According to the applicants, the men assured them that they would check their sons’ identities and release them immediately afterwards.', '10.  In the morning the applicants found their sons’ identity documents on a bedside table in the room. The room was in a mess and a sofa was broken.', '11.  The applicants submitted that the neighbours had told them later that on that night armed men wearing masks, with torches, had been standing on all the landings of their building, between the first and the ninth floors. One of the women neighbours told them that she had been asked about the Aziyev brothers and that she had replied that they were “good boys”.', '12.  In support of their statements, the applicants submitted two written accounts signed by five of their neighbours from the building, including Mr R., and one account from a man who lived in the building opposite theirs, about 30 metres away. They confirmed the applicants’ submissions and stated that in the early hours of 24 September 2000 the doors of two flats in that building had been broken down by a group of men wearing training shoes and armed with automatic rifles. They asked the neighbours about the Aziyev family, with whom the neighbours were on good terms. One of the neighbours saw the group of armed men walking afterwards towards the military roadblock at the intersection of Tukhachevskogo and Kaspara Streets.', '13.  The applicants have had no news of their sons since.', '14.  The Government did not dispute the circumstances of the Aziyev brothers’ detention as presented by the applicants. They submitted that during the night of 24 September 2000 unidentified persons wearing camouflage uniforms and masks and armed with automatic weapons had arrested the brothers L.-A. and U.-A. Aziyev at 49 Tukhachevskogo Street, apartment no. 79, and taken them away to an unknown destination. The same persons had caused physical injuries to the first applicant.', '15.  On 24 September 2000, in the morning, the first applicant was taken by his neighbours to Hospital no. 9 and underwent a medical examination.', '16.  The examination established that he had a craniocerebral injury, an avulsed wound (with detached tissue) in the temple area, a haematoma of the head as well as concussion, temporary blindness, a haematoma of the thorax and the subcutaneous stomach tissue, a haematoma of the scrotum, uraemia, fractured ribs and a contusion of the liver, of the kidneys and of the bladder.', '17.  The first applicant submitted that he had had to stay in bed for about a month to recover.', '18.  According to the Government, the first applicant had first notified the authorities of the beatings in February 2001. The first applicant argued that he had talked about his injuries to the investigators who had questioned him on 24 September 2000, and that he had mentioned the beatings in a letter to the prosecutor of the Chechen Republic dated 9 December 2000, a copy of which had been submitted to the Court.', '19.  On an unspecified date the Grozny Town Prosecutor’s Office (“the Grozny prosecutor’s office”) ordered a forensic medical examination of the first applicant so as to ascertain whether there was a causal link between his injuries and the actions of unknown servicemen who had raided his flat on 24 September 2000 and beaten him.', '20.  This examination was carried out on 8 February 2001. The report relied on a medical record indicating the results of the medical examination carried out on 24 September 2000 and confirmed that the injuries in question could have been sustained during the period and in the circumstances described by the first applicant.', '21.  It appears that the first applicant’s allegations were investigated in the context of criminal proceedings brought in respect of the abduction of his two sons and that on 17 December 2003 he was granted victim status in that connection.', '22.  In 2005 the investigating authorities ordered another forensic medical examination on the ground that the results of the examination of 8 February 2001 were unreliable. On 10 March 2005 experts reported that they had not found any signs of injury to the first applicant’s head, face or body, and that X-ray examinations had not disclosed any damage to the first applicant’s heart, lungs or ribs. With reference to the medical record made in Hospital no. 9 on 24 September 2000 the experts concluded that the injuries complained of by the applicant had been acquired on that date, and that the first applicant had been likely to have sustained those injuries during the period and in the circumstances described by him. The report also stated that there were no objective data to confirm the conclusion of the examination of 24 September 2000 that the applicant had had fractured ribs, concussion and contusions of the liver, of the kidneys and of the bladder.', '23.  Since 24 September 2000 the applicants have repeatedly applied in person and in writing to various public bodies, including the district office of the Ministry of the Interior (“the ROVD”), prosecutors at various levels, a military commander’s office, the administrative authorities of Chechnya and the Special Envoy of the Russian President in the Chechen Republic for Rights and Freedoms. They have been supported in their efforts by two NGOs: Memorial and the SRJI. In their letters to the authorities the applicants referred to their sons’ detention and asked for assistance and details of the investigation. Mostly these enquiries have remained unanswered, or purely formal replies have been given in which the applicants’ requests have been forwarded to various prosecutors’ offices.', '24.  The first applicant has also visited a number of detention centres and prisons in Chechnya as well as further afield in the Northern Caucasus, but has received no information as to the whereabouts of his sons.', '25.  On 29 September 2000 the Grozny prosecutor’s office instituted a criminal investigation into the disappearance of the applicants’ sons under Article 126 § 2 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping of two or more persons by a group using firearms). The case file was assigned no. 12200.', '26.  On 11 October 2000 the Grozny prosecutor’s office granted the second applicant victim status. According to the Government, she was notified of that decision the same day. From the applicants’ submissions it appears that they were not informed of that decision until May 2003, when they received a copy of it.', '27.  On 29 November 2000 the Grozny prosecutor’s office suspended the criminal proceedings for failure to establish the identity of those responsible.', '28.  On 9 December 2000 the first applicant wrote to the public prosecutor’s office of the Chechen Republic (“the Chechnya prosecutor’s office”) and stated the circumstances of his sons’ detention and of his injuries. He stated that his children had never taken part in the activities of illegal armed groups and asked for the persons who had committed the crime to be identified.', '29.  In a letter of 19 January 2001 the Chechnya prosecutor’s office informed the applicants that the decision of 29 November 2000 had been set aside.', '30.  On 1 February 2001 the investigation of the disappearance of Lom-Ali and Umar-Ali Aziyev was resumed.', '31.  On 1 March 2001 the criminal proceedings in case no. 12200 were adjourned, since no culprits had been identified.', '32.  On 11 September 2001 the second applicant submitted a complaint to the Chechnya prosecutor’s office. In it she outlined the circumstances of her sons’ detention and mentioned that in June 2001 she had seen a list of persons who had allegedly been detained at the Khankala military base and that the name of Lom-Ali Aziyev, detained on 23 September 2000, had been on that list.', '33.  In a letter of 19 June 2002, in response to a request from Memorial on the applicants’ behalf, the Chechnya prosecutor’s office stated that the decision of 1 March 2001 had been quashed, and the investigation of the abduction of the Aziyev brothers reopened.', '34.  In a letter of 30 July 2002 the Chechnya prosecutor’s office informed the applicants of the decision to reopen the criminal proceedings in case no. 12200.', '35.  According to a letter from the Grozny prosecutor’s office dated 29 October 2002, the criminal proceedings were again suspended on 6 September 2002.', '36.  In a letter of 17 September 2003 the Chechnya prosecutor’s office informed the applicants that the investigation of the disappearance of their sons had been suspended on 27 July 2003, as the perpetrators had not been found.', '37.  It appears that some time later the investigation was resumed, as in a decision of 17 December 2003 the prosecutor’s office of the Leninskiy District of Grozny (“the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office) declared the first applicant to be a victim of crime in case no. 12200.', '38.  On 22 June 2005 the SRJI, on behalf of the applicants, requested the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office to give them an update of the investigation of the kidnapping of the Aziyev brothers and to allow the applicants, as victims, access to the investigation file. In July 2005 the district prosecutor’s office replied that the investigation had been adjourned on 28 April 2005 and that all the necessary investigative measures had been taken. The second applicant was invited to access the file at the prosecutor’s office during working hours.', '39.  On 1 November 2005 the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office informed the first applicant that the investigation had been resumed. On 1 December 2005 the first applicant was informed that the investigation had been adjourned and of his right to appeal.', '40.  The applicants submitted that their health had deteriorated significantly since the events of 24 September 2000 and the disappearance of their sons. They presented a number of medical documents, according to which the first applicant was suffering from the consequences of a stroke and the second applicant had chronic hypertension and rheumatological problems.', '41.  In their observations the Government did not dispute the information concerning the investigation of the abduction of the Aziyev brothers as presented by the applicants. Relying on information obtained from the General Prosecutor’s Office, they referred to a number of other procedural steps taken by the investigation which had not been mentioned by the applicants. However, despite specific requests from the Court and two reminders, the Government did not submit copies of most of the documents to which they referred (see below).', '42.  With reference to the information provided by the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government submitted that the investigation of the abduction of Lom-Ali and Umar-Ali Aziyev and the inflicting of injuries to the first applicant by “unidentified masked men in camouflage uniforms with machine guns” had commenced on 29 September 2000. They further submitted that an investigator from the Grozny prosecutor’s office had examined the scene of the incident on 24 September 2000, but “had not found any evidence of crime”. The investigator also questioned the applicants.', '43.  The first applicant was questioned further on 22 June 2002, 17 December 2003, 21 February and 5 April 2005, and the second applicant was questioned as a witness on 11 October 2000 and 22 June 2002. The applicants were granted victim status on 17 December 2003 and 11 October 2000 respectively.', '44.  In April 2005 new charges were brought against the same unidentified persons who had stolen the applicants’ property. The Government submitted that in September 2006 the investigation had sent requests to all the district departments of the interior in Chechnya with the aim of establishing the whereabouts of the pair of shoes and video player stolen from the applicants.', '45.  As the Government stated, the investigation questioned a number of witnesses. On unspecified dates two of the applicants’ neighbours, including Mr. R., testified that during the night of 24 September 2000 “unidentified armed men in camouflage uniforms had burst into their flat, checked their documents and then left”. Mr R. had been additionally questioned in October and November 2006, when the investigation decided that no further criminal investigation would be opened, as the witness had not sustained any damage.', '46.  In November 2005 and October 2006 the investigation questioned twelve persons, some of them the applicants’ relatives and neighbours. According to the Government, they confirmed the arrest of the Aziyev brothers in September 2000 by unidentified armed men. Apparently, the witnesses were mostly aware of this event by hearsay. According to the Government, it was impossible to find other witnesses in the case.', '47.  The Government submitted that the investigating authorities had sent a number of queries to various State bodies on 11 October 2000, 3, 10, 11 and 16 February and 23 October 2001, 21 June 2002, 1 December 2003, 14 February and 2 November 2005 and had taken other investigative measures, but did not specify what those measures had been. They also submitted that in April 2005 the investigation had sent requests to all district departments of the interior in Chechnya with the aim of establishing the whereabouts of the Aziyev brothers; however, no relevant information had been obtained. The Government referred to a reply from the criminal police Department of the Ministry of the Interior of Chechnya, which had stated that the two men had not been detained by that body and had not been delivered to the law-enforcement authorities.', '48.  According to the documents submitted by the Government, between September 2000 and November 2006 the investigation was suspended and resumed on eight occasions, and has so far failed to identify those guilty. In the latest decision to resume the investigation, dated 10 November 2006, the deputy prosecutor of the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office criticised the progress of the investigation and stated that a number of important investigative steps should be taken without delay. These included the following actions:\\n“ – to collect his sons’ identity documents from [the first applicant];\\n - to obtain full descriptions of the brothers U.-A. and L.-A. Aziyev;\\n - to question the applicants further in order to find out which language the abductors spoke;\\n - to make a legal assessment of the actions of the persons who unlawfully broke into the apartments of [the applicants] and [their neighbour Mr. R.];\\n - to question the sister of the two kidnapped men;\\n - to question the inhabitants of the nearby houses in order to find out whether they saw servicemen walking to the checkpoint that night.”\\nThe Government further submitted that the progress of the investigation was being supervised by the Prosecutor General’s Office. According to the Government, the applicants had been duly informed of all decisions taken during the investigation.', '49.  Despite specific requests by the Court the Government did not disclose most of the contents of criminal case no. 12200, providing only copies of decisions to suspend and resume the investigation and to grant victim status, as well as of several notifications to the relatives of the adjournment and reopening of the proceedings. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings.', '50.  On 30 December 2002 the SRJI applied on the applicants’ behalf to the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny (“the District Court”), complaining that the Grozny prosecutor’s office had failed to investigate the disappearance of Lom-Ali and Umar-Ali Aziyev effectively.', '51.  On 19 May 2003 the District Court dismissed that complaint, having found that the investigating authorities had taken all necessary measures to find the Aziyev brothers and those involved in their abduction. The applicants did not appeal against that decision.

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Piešťany.', '7.  The applicant is a lawyer. He used to be a public prosecutor and is now a practising member of the Slovak bar association.', '8.  Between August 1999 and March 2001 the applicant acted as the legal representative of several industrial companies belonging to a group associated with a strategic steelworks in eastern Slovakia. For a period of time starting on 18 April 2001 he was on the board of directors of the company owning the works.', '9.  In 1999 the Minister of the Interior set up a special team of investigators to investigate large-scale organised criminal activities of a financial nature which were supposedly being committed in connection with a company belonging to the above group. The team was composed of officers from the financial police.', '10.  On an unspecified date the investigators charged an individual, I.C., with aggravated fraud.', '11.  On an unspecified date the investigators applied for judicial authorisation to tap the applicant’s telephone. At an unspecified time a judge of the Bratislava Regional Court granted the authorisation. The applicant’s professional mobile phone was subsequently tapped.', '12.  In November 2000 the applicant learned that calls from his phone were being intercepted; that the interception was being carried out by the financial police; and that the contents of his telephone communications were known outside the police.', '13.  On 5 January 2001 the applicant received an anonymous letter confirming the above information and advising him that the interception had taken place from October to December 2000 and had been carried out at the request of opponents of his clients.', '14.  On 31 May 2001 and 1 June 2001 a daily paper published interviews with the Minister of the Interior and the chief of the Police Corps. From those interviews the applicant understood that there had been confirmation that the interception had actually taken place.', '15.  Verbatim records of the applicant’s calls had been leaked to various interest groups, politicians and journalists, as well as to representatives of several legal persons.', '16.  Thus in September 2001 the daily Sme received by mail a transcript of the applicant’s telephone conversation with a journalist of Radio Free Europe. On 13 October 2001 Sme published a statement by a politician who had declared at a press conference that he possessed approximately 300 pages of copies of transcripts of the applicant’s telephone conversations.', '17.  In summer 2002 the applicant was informed that verbatim records of his conversations with third persons which had been made by the financial police were freely accessible on a website. They included conversations with his colleagues, clients, the representative of the other party in a case, and friends. The records had been manipulated in that they included statements which the applicant and the other persons involved had not made.', '18.  On 15 and 29 January 2001 the applicant informed the Inspection Service of the Ministry of the Interior (“the Inspection Service”) that he had been warned in a letter signed “member of the Financial Police” about the interception of his telephone. He claimed that the interception was unlawful and unjustified and accused one or more unknown police officers of having abused their official authority. The applicant stated that an appropriate investigation should be carried out into the matter in accordance with the law.', '19.  The director of the special division of the financial and criminal police (odbor zvláštnych úloh správy kriminálnej a finančnej polície) lodged a criminal complaint as, on the basis of his own examination of the case file, he had come to the conclusion that the interception contravened sections 36 and 37 (1) of the Police Corps Act 1993 (see Relevant domestic law and practice below). This was so in particular because it had not been based on any specific suspicion against the person being targeted and no specific purpose had been indicated. In his view, the members of the special investigative team had abused their official authority within the meaning of Article 158 of the Criminal Code.', '20.  On 10 May 2001 the judge who had authorised the interception made a written statement to the President of the Regional Court. The judge stated that the request for the authorisation had met all formal and substantive requirements. In his view, the police director had no authority to challenge the authorisation. The judge therefore considered it inappropriate to address the substance of the director’s objections. He nevertheless remarked, in general, that requests for authorisation were made in writing, but were submitted in person. The officer submitting the request had presented the case orally and the oral presentation was usually more comprehensive than the written request. As requests for authorisation had to be handled with the utmost urgency, judges had had no realistic opportunity to examine the case file or to check that the request for authorisation corresponded to the contents of the case file. Furthermore, the information in the case file was often obtained from unverifiable sources. Judges therefore had to rely on the information in the request for authorisation, which presupposed a certain element of trust. The judge further observed that there had been an enormous increase in the workload concerning tapping and that this was due, inter alia, to an inter‑agency agreement which had been reached under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice (see Relevant domestic law and practice below) and had extended the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Regional Court in this area. In his view, questions of jurisdiction should not be regulated by “agreements” but by statute, which was not the case in relation to tapping. The judge stated that telephone tapping had been authorised on three previous occasions in the course of the investigation into the suspected extensive criminal transactions within the industrial group mentioned above. He had thus had sufficient and detailed knowledge about the applicant’s case. The judge associated himself completely with the decision taken, although the suspicion against the applicant might later have been dispelled. This was nothing unusual and happened in 10-20% of cases.', '21.  On 22 May 2001 the applicant asked the General Prosecutor to take measures with a view to eliminating unlawful interception and recording of telephone conversations.', '22.  On 20 June 2001 the Inspection Service questioned the applicant in connection with his complaint. According to the applicant, since then there has been no official communication concerning his complaint and he has not been informed of the outcome of the investigation.', '23.  On 21 June and 2 July 2001 the Inspection Service requested that the Ministry of the Interior discharge members of the special investigative team from the obligation of confidentiality in respect of the subject matter of the investigation. The Ministry agreed on 9 and 10 July 2001 respectively.', '24.   On 31 August 2001 the General Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant, in reply to his above request of 22 May 2001, that the framework for the interference was defined by Article 22 § 2 of the Constitution and the relevant statutory provisions including the Police Corps Act 1993. Decree no. 66/1992 defined the court’s jurisdiction in such matters in cases where criminal proceedings had not been brought. The fact that the relevant issue was not governed by a law was only a formal shortcoming. Moreover, a draft law had been prepared to cover the relevant issue.', '25.  Between 5 and 20 September 2001 the Inspection Service questioned four members of the investigative team. Their depositions included, inter alia, the information that the operative part of the team had been colluding with the applicant; that the applicant had been in close contact with I.C. (see paragraph 10 above); that the applicant had been involved in several contractual transactions within the group, which had eventually harmed the interests of the steelworks; that the request for authorisation to tap the applicant’s phone had been based on the suspicion that he had committed the offences of aggravated fraud (Article 250 of the Criminal Code) and money laundering (Article 255 of the Criminal Code); that the request had been drafted without consultation of the case file; that the interception had been necessary because it had not been possible to move the investigation forward without it; and that after the interception had been compromised the case file had been made available to various officials, including the Minister of Justice, who at that time also acted as the Minister of the Interior ad interim.', '26.  On 21 September 2001 the Inspection Service dismissed the criminal complaint by the police director. It noted that a “committee of experts specialising in operational tasks” had been set up and “had detected no breach of the applicable regulations”. The interception had been authorised by a judge and had thus been lawful. There was no basis for scrutinising the judge’s decision. In conclusion, there was no case to answer. The decision has never been served on the applicant.', '27.  According to the applicant, he had lodged some ten criminal complaints between 2001 and 2003 about the interception of his telephone conversations and mishandling of the verbatim records. Without submitting further details the applicant indicated that those complaints had been rejected without an appropriate examination of the facts.', '28.  The chief editor of the daily Sme filed a criminal complaint after receipt of a transcription of the applicant’s telephone conversation with a journalist of Radio Free Europe. In the context of the proceedings a journalist of Sme was heard. On 14 November 2001 the police also heard the politician who had stated that he possessed 300 pages of copies of transcripts of the applicant’s telephone conversations. The applicant was involved in the proceedings as the injured party.', '29.  The parties have not informed the Court about the outcome of the proceedings.', '30.  In 2003 lieutenant colonel B., attached to the Inspection Service’s department specialised in combating corruption and organised crime, contacted the applicant and informed him that there was a general order within the Police Corps to reject all the applicant’s complaints. The police officer had been obliged to leave the police after he had started criminal proceedings upon one of the applicant’s complaints. In February and March 2003 that officer had complained to the Bratislava Higher Military Prosecutor’s office and to the General Prosecutor’s office about abuse of authority in the context of examination of the applicant’s complaints.', '31.  The Government submitted a standpoint of the General Prosecutor dated 8 February 2007. It indicates that the above decision of the Inspection Service of 21 September 2001 had been taken in accordance with the law. As to the criminal complaints which officer B. had lodged in 2003, an investigator had set the case aside, on 19 July 2006, on the ground that no offence had been committed in the context of examination of the applicant’s complaints. Finally, reference was made to the reply which the General Prosecutor’s Office had sent to the applicant on 31 August 2001.'], 'applicants': ['KVASNICA'], 'defendants': ['SLOVAKIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['8'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['19', '20', '25', '40', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '48', '49', '75']}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 14, 19], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 14, 19], 'explained_indices': [12, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 25, 24, 11, 6, 0, 10, 8, 1, 9, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.06296629, 0.04350382, 0.006177604, -0.0068820715, -0.048539102, -0.049041927, -0.05890751, -0.070917904, -0.07338852, -0.07916212, -0.12430376, -0.12761676, -0.20618784], 'number_of_sentences': 26, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Oktyabrskiy, Bashkortostan Republic.', '6.  On 10 March 2004 the police opened an investigation against Mikhail Timin, the applicant’s brother, and two other individuals, on charges of extortion. Mr Timin was arrested on the same day and taken to the temporary detention centre of a police station.', '7.  On 11 March 2004 at 7.25 a.m. Mr Timin complained of headaches and cramps in his legs, allegedly resulting from ten days’ drinking. Paramedic A., who had been called by the administration, examined Mr Timin and diagnosed him with alcohol intoxication. She also advised that he be taken to hospital for inpatient treatment. It appears that there was some delay in his transfer to hospital pending the arrival of the convoy officers who would take him. He was taken to a rehabilitation clinic at 10.15 a.m. Doctor Kh. examined and diagnosed him with alcohol withdrawal syndrome and seizures and he was administered treatment. The doctor found him fit for detention and he was discharged from the clinic. He was then taken back to the temporary detention centre.', '8.  At the temporary detention centre Mr Timin did not feel well and the guards once again summoned an emergency response team, which arrived at 3.24 p.m. Paramedics I. and Z. examined and diagnosed him with alcohol intoxication. They recommended that he be given inpatient treatment. The administration of the temporary detention centre did not take him to the clinic, as they had failed to provide a convoy.', '9.  On 12 March 2004 the Oktyabrskiy Town Court of the Bashkortostan Republic (hereinafter “the Town Court”) authorised Mr Timin’s detention pending investigation. He attended the hearing at court. According to investigator Kam., who asked for him to be remanded in custody, he had not complained of any health issues either at the time of his arrest on 10 March 2004 or at the hearing on 12 March 2004.', '10.  Upon his return to the temporary detention centre, Mr Timin was placed in cell no. 3 together with E., S. and Sh. The inmates complained repeatedly to the guards about his aggressive behaviour (he assaulted Sh.) and asked the guards to transfer him to another cell. At 8.45 p.m. he was transferred to cell no. 10, where he was detained in isolation. He did not calm down and continued shouting, swearing and banging on the door.', '11.  On 13 March 2004 at 6.25 a.m. one of the guards heard some noise coming from cell no. 10 and looked through the peephole. He saw Mr Timin lying on the floor. The guard entered the cell, checked for a pulse but there was none. When the emergency response doctor summoned by the guards arrived, Mr Timin was pronounced dead.', '12.  On 13 March 2004 the police carried out an inquiry into the circumstances of Mr Timin’s death and concluded that the guards had failed to properly carry out surveillance over him. The relevant report was then forwarded to the prosecutor’s office, which commissioned a forensic examination to establish the cause of his death.', '13.  On 16 March 2004 the prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal investigation into the death. Investigator A. indicated that Mr Timin had died as a result of acute coronary insufficiency exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal syndrome.', '14.  On the same date the head of the town department of the interior found that the chief of police, his deputy and the police officers on duty at the time of Mr Timin’s death had failed to carry out their duties properly, in particular, they had failed to monitor the detainees closely. The officers were subjected to a disciplinary sanction (a reprimand).', '15.  A forensic examination of Mr Timin’s body was completed on 7 April 2004. The findings of the examination were presented in forensic report no. 89. The expert noted numerous bruises and abrasions on the body which, in his opinion, were not fatal. His conclusion was that Mr Timin had died of acute coronary insufficiency exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal syndrome.', '16.  On 21 July 2004 the town prosecutor quashed the investigator’s decision of 16 March 2004 and remitted the matter for a further inquiry. In particular, he noted:\\n“[The decision of 16 March 2004] is premature, unlawful and ill-founded ...\\nAccording to the forensic medical examination report, [the expert] noted numerous injuries on Mr Timin’s body (fourteen bruises and injuries). However, this fact was not considered in the course of the inquiry. [The investigator] failed to establish under what circumstances Mr Timin had sustained the injuries. In the course of the additional investigation it will be necessary to re-examine the [forensic] documents and to put [further] questions to the forensic expert ...\\nIt follows from the logbook records of the temporary detention unit that [Mr Timin] was in need of urgent inpatient treatment. However, owing to the absence of the convoy officers, he was left in the temporary detention centre. In this connection, it is necessary to question the staff [there].”', '17.  On 25 July 2004 investigator V. commissioned an additional forensic expert examination to clarify the cause of the injuries on Mr Timin’s body.', '18.  On 31 July 2004 investigator V. refused to open a criminal investigation and reiterated the findings of the previous inquiry.', '19.  On 14 September 2004 the additional forensic examination was completed. According to report no. 65, the injuries on Mr Timin’s body had:\\n“... resulted from the impact of blunt solid objects, or a collision with them. It cannot be ruled out that the ... injuries on the rear of the body could have resulted from [Mr Timin] falling on his back ... He could have caused the injuries on the front of the body himself. [The injuries] occurred within a short time of one another. It is not possible to determine the order of their appearance.”', '20.  On 20 September 2004 the acting town prosecutor quashed the decision of 31 July 2004, noting that it had been taken prematurely before the additional forensic examination was completed.', '21.  On 21 September 2004 investigator V. yet again refused to open criminal investigation, reiterating that Mr Timin had died from acute coronary insufficiency exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal syndrome. As regards the injuries, the investigator considered that they might have been self-inflicted, given that Mr Timin had thrown himself against the door of the cell and had had an altercation with other inmates. The investigator questioned the guards, who denied that they had beaten Mr Timin, and G., one of the detainees, who claimed that he had seen through his peephole five or six policemen enter Mr Timin’s cell at around 2 or 3 a.m. The investigator rejected G.’s testimony, noting that it would have been impossible to see the door of Mr Timin’s cell through the peephole of G.’s cell.', '22.  On 31 March 2005 the Town Court found the decision of 21 September 2004 unlawful. The court stated that the investigator had failed to question the medical practitioners who had treated Mr Timin on the day preceding his death. In compliance with the court’s decision of 31 March 2005, on 16 May 2005 the town prosecutor quashed the decision of 21 September 2004 and ordered a further inquiry.', '23.  On 21 May 2005 investigator V. again refused to open a criminal investigation into Mr Timin’s death. On 13 October 2005 the Town Court found the decision unlawful, noting that the investigator had failed to (i) question the medical practitioners who had treated Mr Timin; (ii) identify the staff of the temporary detention centre who had been present when he had been examined by the medical practitioners, in order to elucidate why he had not been transferred to a medical facility in contravention of the emergency response team’s recommendation; and (iii) identify the alleged perpetrators. On 8 November 2005 the acting town prosecutor quashed the decision of 21 May 2005 and ordered a further inquiry into the matter.', '24.  On 11 November 2005 investigator V. refused to open a criminal investigation, reiterating his previous findings practically verbatim. The town prosecutor quashed the decision on 30 November 2005, and on 7 December 2005 ordered a further inquiry and transferred the case to investigator M. It was noted that investigator V. had failed to identify and question various witnesses, including the detainees and medical practitioners.', '25.  On 17 December 2005 investigator M. refused to open a criminal investigation. On 15 June 2006 the Town Court quashed the decision because he had failed to notify the applicant of it.', '26.  It appears that the applicant subsequently lodged several complaints requesting a criminal investigation into the circumstances of her brother’s death. The complaints were dismissed on 26 July and 28 September 2007, but these decisions were quashed by the regional investigative committee on 19 October 2007 because the investigator’s inquiry had been incomplete. In particular, it was noted that the investigator had failed to question the medical practitioners who had examined and treated Mr Timin on 11 March 2004.', '27.  On 28 October 2007 investigator F. refused to open a criminal investigation, reiterating his predecessors’ findings concerning the causes of Mr Timin’s death. The superior investigator quashed the decision on 5 December 2007, noting yet again that the medical practitioners who had treated Mr Timin on the day before he died had not been questioned.', '28.  On 15 December 2007 investigator F. again refused to open a criminal investigation into Mr Timin’s death. His decision was quashed by the regional investigative committee on 10 December 2008. In particular, it was noted that on 11 March 2004, following the recommendations of the medical practitioners who had examined Mr Timin, it had been incumbent on the temporary detention unit to take him to hospital for further treatment. It was further noted that the inquiry conducted by investigator F. had failed to establish the reasons as to why Mr Timin had not been taken to hospital, in contravention of the recommendations of the medical practitioners. Nor had the medical practitioners been questioned.', '29.  On 11 February 2008 the Ministry of Health of the Bashkortostan Republic completed an inquiry into the circumstances of Mr Timin’s death. Their findings were summarised in a report:\\n“1.  Regard being had to the dynamics and clinical picture of [Mr Timin’s] condition and objective data, it can be concluded that [he] developed alcohol withdrawal syndrome with seizures. Treatment was prescribed in accordance with his condition and was aimed at managing the symptoms. 2.  The rehabilitation clinic ... acted in compliance with [applicable legislation] which provides that, as a rule, psychiatric treatment is administered voluntarily, upon the request and approval of a patient.\\nMr Timin did not have a history of alcohol-related [illness]. At the time, he was not psychotic and could understand his actions and control them. There were no grounds for [his] involuntary admission to hospital ... Mr Timin’s condition, when he was released from the rehabilitation clinic and transferred back to the temporary detention centre, was satisfactory. As regards the period from 10.50 a.m. on 11 March to 13 March 2004, there is no information showing that [his] condition deteriorated.”', '30.  On 26 December 2008 investigator R. refused to open criminal proceedings into Mr Timin’s death. He based his findings on forensic reports, medical documentation and witness statements, including those made by the inmates, guards and medical practitioners.', '31.  On 28 August 2009 the Town Court dismissed a complaint by the applicant alleging that the investigator’s decision of 26 December 2008 was unlawful. On 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic upheld the decision on appeal.', '32.  On 14 September 2011 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic quashed the decisions of 28 August and 22 October 2009 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. The court noted, inter alia, as follows:\\n“... in the course of the inquiries [the investigators] failed to duly take into consideration the fact that on 11 March 2004 at 3.24 p.m., following the second examination of Mr Timin, the medical practitioners considered that he should urgently consult the drugs counsellor. However, he was not allowed to do so. This was confirmed by emergency response doctors Z. and I., who diagnosed Mr Timin with alcoholic intoxication with epileptic seizures. They recommended that he be taken to hospital, but the administration of the temporary detention centre refused to do so. [The investigators] did not consider why the administration ... had not complied with the doctors’ recommendation to take Mr Timin to the rehabilitation clinic ...\\nIt follows from the material of the inquiry that Mr Timin did not receive timely or thorough medical assistance; the doctors did not diagnose him correctly, because the administration of the temporary detention centre did not provide the necessary information about [his] behaviour and health condition. This point should have been verified and assessed.”', '33.  On 3 November 2011 the Town Court found the investigator’s decision of 26 December 2008 unlawful and quashed it.', '34.  On 13 December 2011 investigator N. of the investigative committee refused to open a criminal investigation into Mr Timin’s death, concluding that he had died of ischemic heart disease and coronary insufficiency. He discerned no corpus delicti in the actions of the administration of the temporary detention centre or the medical practitioners who had treated him. In his report, he relied on the forensic medical documents, statements made by the police officers from the temporary detention centre and the paramedics who had treated him.', '35.  On 29 February 2012 senior investigator Akh. of the investigative committee opened a criminal investigation on charges of abuse of power.

The applicant was born in the village of Zović and lives in Bitola.', '6.  On 13 September 2000 his brother (“the plaintiff”) brought a civil action against him for a declaration that he owned one half of a plot of land and a house (“the property”).', '7.  A hearing on 9 April 2001 was adjourned because the applicant had not been duly summoned.', '8.  At a hearing on 20 April 2001 the court ordered the plaintiff to provide further particulars of his claim. It further sought to obtain a deed of gift dating from 1984.', \"9.  According to the Government, at a hearing on 24 May 2001 the court granted the plaintiff's request to carry out an on-site inspection (увид) and to examine witnesses. The applicant arrived late at the hearing, but was informed of the place and time of the next hearing. The Government submitted a barely legible copy of the record, which had been signed by the applicant.\", '10.  At the on-site inspection on 5 June 2001, the trial court heard evidence from two witnesses concerning the history of the property. The record indicates that the applicant was absent, even though he had been duly summoned.', \"11.  A hearing fixed for 12 July 2001 was adjourned at the applicant's request.\", \"12.  At a hearing on 14 September 2001 the plaintiff's counsel stated that his client had suffered a stroke and was not medically fit to give a statement. The court ordered him to submit a medical report and on a later date in September 2001, the plaintiff's counsel submitted a medical report certifying that his client was not medically fit to give a statement.\", '13.  On 8 November 2001 the composition of the bench changed and the hearing restarted.', \"14.  At a hearing on 22 November 2001 the applicant disputed the plaintiff's legal capacity to bring the proceedings. He stated, inter alia:\\n“... [A]fter reviewing the file, I have concerns as to the validity of the plaintiff's letters of authority... We propose that the court assess his capacity...”\", \"15.  According to the court record, the court ruled that the next hearing would be held on 29 November 2001 on-site in order to assess the plaintiff's health and the validity of his signature on the letter of authority. It further noted that those present should consider the announcement of the next hearing as equivalent to service of a court summons. The applicant and his counsel both attended the hearing.\", \"16.  On 29 November 2001 the court held a hearing at the scheduled time, but in the court room instead of on-site. The court heard evidence from the plaintiff and established the validity of the letter of authority. It further read the record of the on-site inspection of 5 June 2001 and the witnesses' statements. It noted that the applicant was absent, even though he had been duly summoned. Following the hearing, the trial court gave a decision declaring the plaintiff to be the owner of the property and ordered the applicant to recognise his title. It based its findings on a court decision of 1962 by which the plaintiff had been declared heir of the property. It further established that he had lived in the house and had had actual possession (владение) of the property since. The trial court based its decision on considerable evidence: an expert opinion; a record of the on-site inspection; statements of witnesses; and other physical evidence.\", '17.  On 8 January 2001 the applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that he had been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. He said that he had been prevented from attending the hearing on 29 November 2001 as it was held in the court room, instead of on-site as scheduled. He submitted that that failure could be regarded as a substantial defect in the proceedings, contrary to section 340(2)(7) of the Civil Proceedings Act (see “Relevant domestic law” below). He further complained that the trial court had taken into consideration the statements of the witnesses from the on-site hearing of 5 June 2001 which had been held in his absence.', \"18.  On 25 February 2002 the Bitola Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the lower court's decision finding no grounds to depart from the reasons given. Concerning the applicant's complaints about the hearing of 29 November 2001, it stated:\\n“... [The applicant] was duly summoned as he attended the hearing of 22 November 2001 when the date and time for the hearing were fixed. Therefore, he was obliged to appear in court and depending on whether the plaintiff was also present, it was for the court to decide whether it would visit the plaintiff in his home or hold the hearing in the court room. As the plaintiff appeared in the court ... it was not necessary to go on-site... [The applicant] was properly summoned and has failed to justify his absence...”\", \"19.  As regards the applicant's complaints concerning the examination of the witnesses at the on-site hearing on 5 June 2001, the court stated, inter alia:\\n“... [The applicant's] complaints that the court examined the witnesses at the hearing on 5 June 2001 in his absence are ill-founded, as he failed to attend, despite having been duly summoned...

The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Volgograd.', '5.  In 1986 the applicant was engaged in emergency operations at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. As a result he suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions. In 1997 he underwent medical examinations which established a link between his poor health and his involvement in the Chernobyl events. The applicant was awarded compensation, to be paid monthly.', '6.  In 2000 the applicant brought proceedings against the Welfare Office of the Krasnooktyabrskiy District of the Volgograd Region (Управление социальной защиты населения Краснооктябрьского района Волгоградской области - “the defendant”) for an increase in the compensation, for the increase to be backdated and for recovery of the unpaid amount. The applicant considered that the amount of compensation had been determined incorrectly.', \"7.  On 5 October 2000 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court of Volgograd upheld the applicant's action and awarded him a lump sum of 113,707.59 Russian roubles (RUB) and monthly payments of RUB 4,051.88, to be paid before the date of the subsequent medical examination, which was made in June 2002.\", \"8.  On 24 April 2002 the lump sum, and on 29 April 2003 and on 30 May 2003 the arrears of the monthly payments, were credited to the applicant's account, so that the judgment was enforced in full.\", \"9.  On 13 February 2004, at the defendant's request, the Presidium of the Volgograd Regional Court quashed the judgment of 5 October 2000 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. The basis for this decision was that the District Court had applied the substantive law incorrectly.\", \"10.  On 4 June 2004 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court of Volgograd terminated the proceedings due to the applicant's failure to appear. The applicant did not appeal. Instead, he brought another set of proceedings with the same court, claiming adjustment of monthly payments and seeking damages for 1997-2007.\", \"11.  After several sets of proceedings, by a final judgment of 16 August 2007 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court of Volgograd granted the applicant's claims in part, i.e. lowering the amounts previously awarded by the judgment of 5 October 2000. It took into account that the latter judgment had been quashed on 13 February 2004, recalculated the sums paid under it and deducted the difference from the sums awarded.

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in the village of Bratskoye, Nadterechny District, Chechnya.', '7.  The facts of the case as submitted by the parties are summarised in section A below (paragraphs 8-54). A description of the documents submitted by the parties is contained in section B below (paragraphs 55-84).', \"8.  The applicant is a co-owner of real estate in the village of Bratskoye. The other co-owner is the applicant's brother, Mr Dzhabrail Abulkhanovich Khamidov, who is not a party to the proceedings before the Court. In reply to the Registry's specific query in that respect, the applicant's representative stated in a letter of 14 February 2004 that the applicant's brother did not intend to participate in the proceedings before the Court, that the applicant had participated in the domestic proceedings by himself (see below) and that in any event the applicant had furnished the Court with a general power of attorney granted to him by his brother. The document in question confirms the applicant's right to represent his brother before the Court if necessary.\", \"9.  Prior to the events described below, the applicant and his brother registered a limited liability company called Nedra (общество с ограниченной ответственностью «Недра») and, together with their families (hereafter “the applicant's family”), ran a bakery business. According to the applicant, this business was their main source of income.\", \"10.  The estate (hereafter “the applicant's estate”) comprises a plot of land of 1.5 hectares transferred to the Nedra company under an indefinite lease, a house of 251.3 square metres owned by the applicant, a house of 186 square metres owned by his brother and industrial buildings and equipment, including a mill, a bakery and storage facilities with a total surface of 2,000 square metres assigned to the Nedra company.\", '11.  In late 1996, as alleged by the Government, or in early 1998, as alleged by the applicant, he and his family left their estate as they were constantly threatened by Chechen rebel fighters, who then moved in.', \"12.  At the beginning of September 1999 the fighters left and the applicant and his family returned to their estate. According to the applicant, they found quarters that had been built by the fighters on the plot of land using the applicant's building materials, but the houses, industrial premises and equipment had remained intact and they restarted their business.\", '13.  In early October 1999 the Russian Government launched a counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic. Fearing possible attacks, the applicant and his relatives left the village.', \"14.  On 13 October 1999 the Tambov consolidated police units of the Ministry of the Interior (Тамбовский сводный отряд милиции МВД РФ – “the police units”) moved onto the applicant's estate.\", '15.  On 19 October 1999 the applicant and his family tried to return, but the police units denied them access to the estate.', '16.  On 4 November 1999 the applicant requested the Nadterechny Temporary Office of the Interior (временный ОВД Надтеречного района – “the VOVD”) to vacate his houses and industrial premises.', \"17.  By a letter of 19 December 1999 the VOVD refused the applicant's request. The letter stated that they would only vacate the buildings after the termination of the hostilities in the region and the withdrawal of the Russian troops. As to the alleged damage to the applicant's property, the letter advised him to lodge a compensation claim with a court.\", '18.  Since, at the material time, the courts on the territory of the Chechen Republic were inoperative, the applicant only submitted his claims in January 2001.', \"19.  The applicant and his family spent the winter of 1999-2000 in a refugee tent camp in the village of Znamenskoye, Chechnya. According to him, poor living conditions in the camp resulted in the death of his nephew, who was one year and seven months' old. The applicant submitted medical death certificate no. 00-172 issued in respect of his nephew on 29 December 2000. It states that the boy died of acute double bronchial pneumonia. The date and place of death are recorded as 27 December 1999, Northern refugee camp. The applicant also claimed that the health of other family members had seriously deteriorated.\", \"20.  On 27 January and 16 October 2000 respectively, the head of the local council of the village of Bratskoye (глава органа местного самоуправления с. Братское) issued three similar certificates in respect of the applicant, his brother and their company Nedra, stating that federal police units had been occupying the applicant's estate since 13 October 1999 and refused to move out.\", \"21.  On 25 May 2000, upon the applicant's request, the military commander of the Nadterechny District (военный комендант Надтеречного района) ordered the police units to ensure that no damage would be caused to the applicant's property. According to the applicant, no measures to protect his property followed.\", \"22.  On 26 May 2000, upon the applicant's request, a commission composed of the head of the local council of Bratskoye, representatives of planning and building organisations (представитель проектной организации, представитель подрядной организации) and the military commander drew up evaluation reports (дефектные акты) reflecting in detail the poor state of the applicant's property (see paragraphs 63-67 below).\", \"23.  Another commission made up of the head of the local council and several residents of Bratskoye issued a certificate stating that federal interior troops had been stationed on the applicant's estate from 13 October 1999 until 26 May 2000, and that they had damaged the applicant's houses and industrial premises, the damage having been certified by the above-mentioned evaluation reports. The undated certificate was signed and sealed by the commission members and the military commander.\", \"24.  In a letter of 12 September 2000 an acting prosecutor of the Nadterechny District (исполняющий обязанности прокурора Надтеречного района) suggested that the military commander should order the police units either to vacate the applicant's house or enter into a lease agreement with him. The commander never responded.\", \"25.  By a letter of 25 December 2000 an acting prosecutor of the Nadterechny District invited the applicant to apply to a court in the event of the police units' refusal to follow the above recommendation.\", '26.  From November 1999 to December 2000 the applicant also lodged a large number of complaints with State bodies, including military authorities, prosecutors at various levels and other law-enforcement agencies, regional and federal administrative authorities, seeking eviction of the police units. Mostly he received formal responses by which his complaints were transmitted to other bodies, but no effective measures were taken.\\n(b)  Eviction proceedings', '27.  In January 2001 the courts in Chechnya became operational again. The applicant, in his own name and on behalf of his brother, brought an action in which he sought the eviction of the Tambov consolidated police units from his estate.', \"28.  By a default judgment of 14 February 2001 the Nadterechny District Court of the Chechen Republic confirmed the title of the applicant and his brother to the plot of land and the houses and industrial premises, with reference to numerous documents submitted by the applicant. The court, having examined the evidence submitted by the applicant, found as follows:\\n“...Internal troops and police units from various regions of Russia involved in the counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic occupied the houses and industrial premises belonging to the Khamidovs, without seeking approval of the rightful owners and in breach of all the provisions of law in force and the Constitution of Russia. The power structures, called upon to protect the interests of civilians, have themselves turned to breaching the Constitution of Russia...\\n...\\nThe well-foundedness of [the applicant's] claim can also be confirmed by the district prosecutor's letter addressed to the district military commander, which states that since 13 October 1999 the police units of the federal troops have been occupying the residential and industrial premises belonging to [the applicant] on the western outskirts of the village of Bratskoye in the Nadterechny District. The actions of the police units of the federal forces have flagrantly breached [the applicant's] housing and civil rights secured by the Constitution of Russia and by housing and civil legislation.\\n...\\nEarlier, on 25 May 2000, the military commander of the Nadterechny District issued an order obliging the defendant to preserve the Khamidovs' property and upon the expiry of a three-month period to return them their property intact.\\nThe defendant ignored this order.”\\nThe court concluded that the Tambov police units of the Ministry of the Interior had adversely occupied the applicant's estate and ordered their eviction, thus allowing the applicant's claim in full.\", \"29.  On 24 February 2001 the judgment came into force and enforcement proceedings were commenced accordingly. A bailiff's attempts to enforce the judgment proved to have been in vain, as the police units refused to comply with the writ of execution. In his attempts to enforce the judgment the bailiff unsuccessfully sought the assistance of the head of the administration of the Nadterechny District, the military commander of the Nadterechny District and the military commander of the Chechen Republic.\", \"30.  The applicant's numerous complaints to local and federal administrative bodies were to no avail.\", \"31.  On 2 March 2001 the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic forwarded the applicant's request to enforce the judgment in his favour to the Chechen Minister of Justice and invited him to take the necessary measures.\", \"32.  According to the Government, in April 2001, within the statutory time-limit provided for in domestic law for the enforcement of a final judgment, the Tambov police units vacated the buildings on the applicant's estate, but relocated to the applicant's plot of land instead.\", \"33.  On 21 May 2001 the Special Envoy of the Russian President for Rights and Freedoms in the Chechen Republic (Специальный представитель Президента Российской Федерации по соблюдению прав и свобод человека в Чеченской Республике) requested the Russian Minister of the Interior to order the enforcement of the judgment of 14 February 2001. On 18 July 2001 the Special Envoy sent the applicant's new complaint to the Minister of the Interior and stated that he had still not received any reply to his previous query of 21 May 2001.\", \"34.  On 22 May 2001 the President of the State Duma Commission for the Promotion of the Normalisation of the Political, Social, and Economic Situation and the Protection of Human Rights in the Chechen Republic (Комиссия по содействию нормализации общественно-политической и социально-экономической обстановки и соблюдению прав человека в Чеченской Республике) notified the Minister of the Interior of the unlawful occupation by the police units of the applicant's estate and their refusal to comply with the judgment in the applicant's favour and requested that the Minister take up the applicant's case, given that it had already attracted the attention of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe.\", \"35.  On 30 May 2001 the first deputy-head of the Office of the President of Russia (Администрация Президента – “the President's Office”) transmitted the applicant's complaint to the Minister of the Interior for examination.\", \"36.  On 7 June 2001 the General Prosecutor's Office forwarded the applicant's complaint to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic (прокуратура Чеченской республики) “for examination on the merits”.\", \"37.  By letter of 13 June 2001 the first deputy commander of the United Group Alignment in the Northern Caucasus (первый заместитель командующего ОГВ(с) в СКР – “the deputy commander”) informed the Nadterechny District Court that the judgment in the applicant's favour had been executed and the defendant units had left the applicant's estate. In reply, on 26 June 2001 a bailiff reported that the judgment remained unenforced. He stated that he had visited the applicant's estate and found out that even though the Tambov consolidated police units had left, the Tula consolidated police units (Тульский сводный отряд милиции) had moved into the applicant's property.\", \"38.  On 18 June 2001 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic invited the Chief Bailiff of Russia (главный судебный пристав РФ) to provide information as to what measures had been taken to enforce the judgment in the applicant's favour and whether the question of administrative or criminal liability for evasion from enforcement by the personnel of the consolidated police units had ever been raised. It is unclear whether any answer was given to this query.\", \"39.  On 26 June 2001 the Chief Bailiff informed the President's Office that the term allowed for the examination of the applicant's complaint regarding the prolonged non-enforcement had been extended for 30 days.\", \"40.  On 27 June 2001 the Ministry of the Interior informed the President's Office that the judgment of 14 February 2001 had been enforced.\", \"41.  In a letter of 30 June 2001 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic, with reference to the letter of the deputy commander of 13 June 2001, notified the applicant that the judgment had been executed.\", \"42.  According to the Government, on 4 July 2001 the bailiff imposed a fine equal to 200 times the minimum monthly salary on the police units for their refusal to comply with the court judgment. The fine, however, could not be recovered because of delays in the payment of wages to military personnel in Chechnya. The Government also submitted that on 14 July 2001 the Tambov police units had left the territory of the applicant's estate, and the bailiff had closed the enforcement proceedings and returned the writ of execution to the Nadterechny District Court on 17 July 2001, but thereafter the Tula police units had occupied the applicant's estate.\", \"43.  On 30 July 2001, in the course of the eviction proceedings, the bailiff drew up three reports on the eviction of the police units from the applicant's houses and industrial premises. The reports listed items of the applicant's property that had been destroyed or damaged and were signed by the applicant, the bailiff and two attesting witnesses (see paragraphs 68-71 below). It does not appear that the actual eviction took place.\", '44.  In a letter of 10 August 2001 a Deputy Chief Bailiff of Russia informed the applicant of the developments in his case, stating that the execution of the judgment depended in fact on the Ministry of the Interior rather than on the efforts of a bailiff.', \"45.  By a letter of 13 August 2001 the President's Office transmitted the applicant's new complaint to the Ministry of Justice. It also referred to the Chief Bailiff's letter of 26 June 2001 and stated that even though 30 days had already passed, no information had been submitted on the developments in the enforcement proceedings.\", \"46.  On 26 February 2002 the bailiff reported that on an unspecified date the police had vacated the houses, but remained in quarters they had built on the applicant's land and continued using the applicant's resources for their needs. The report also stated that the Tula consolidated police units had been replaced by the Kaluga consolidated police units (сводный отряд милиции УВД Калужской области), that trenches, check-points and barbed wire restricted access to the land, and that the applicant could not enter it even for a short time, let alone permanently reside there.\", \"47.  On 14 June 2002 the bailiff closed the enforcement proceedings, as the police units had finally left the applicant's estate. The bailiff drew up a report on the eviction, briefly indicating the damage to the applicant's property. It was signed by the applicant, the bailiff and two attesting witnesses (see paragraph 72 below).\", '48.  On 30 July 2001 the applicant, acting in his own name and on behalf of his brother, brought an action against the Russian Ministry of the Interior in the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow (Замоскворецкий межмуниципальный суд г. Москвы – “the District Court”). He complained that the consolidated police units of the Ministry of the Interior had occupied and wrecked his estate and had been refusing to comply with the judgment of 14 February 2001. He sought recovery of possession of his movables and real property as well as compensation in an amount of 10,787,040 Russian roubles (RUB; approximately EUR 315,732) for pecuniary losses that he had sustained as a result of the adverse occupation of his estate and compensation in an amount of RUB 5,241,175 (approximately EUR 153,418) for the damage caused thereto. The applicant also stated that as a result of the unauthorised occupation of his estate he and his family had had to live in a refugee camp in appalling conditions which had resulted in the death of his nephew, and he claimed compensation of RUB 10,000,000 (approximately EUR 292,685) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.', \"49.  The applicant filed numerous documents in support of his claims, including those confirming his and his brother's title to the houses, industrial buildings and the plot of land, two registration certificates in respect of the Nedra company, his applications to various State bodies and respective replies, a copy of the judgment of 14 February 2001 and the bailiff's reports on the police units' failure to comply with that judgment as well as the certificate issued by the commission made up of the head of the local council of Bratskoye and local residents (see paragraph 23 above), together with the evaluation reports of 26 May 2000 and estimates of repair costs for his property.\", \"50.  On 23 January 2002 the District Court delivered its judgment. At the trial the defendant Ministry did not contest, as such, the accuracy of the applicant's submissions or the evidence he had presented, but denied its responsibility for the consolidated police units, stating that they had formed part of the federal troops within the territory of Chechnya and had been under the command of the military authorities of the United Group Alignment. The court made no comment in respect of those submissions by the defendant Ministry. It examined the material before it and established that the applicant owned the property in question, that the local council had certified on 16 October 2000 the unauthorised occupation of that property by federal police units, that the applicant had requested the authorities to ensure his estate be vacated and that by a judgment of 14 February 2001 the Nadterechny District Court had ordered the eviction of the Tambov consolidated police units from the applicant's premises. The court further found as follows:\\n“The plaintiffs have filed a certificate issued by [the commission composed of] the head of the local council and residents of Bratskoye. The certificate states that the federal military were located on the plaintiffs' estate from 13 October 1999 until 26 May 2000 and that they caused damage to the plaintiffs' property.\\nThe plaintiffs have produced evaluation reports and estimates of repair costs to corroborate their arguments concerning the property damage. The plaintiffs have also adduced a calculation of lost profit ...\\nHaving assessed the evidence in its entirety, the court sees no reason to allow the plaintiffs' claims, since the houses and industrial premises have already been vacated, as the [first] plaintiff has confirmed during the hearing. Besides, another judgment in force ordered the police units' eviction, and enforcement proceedings were commenced.\\nThe court cannot award repair costs and compensation for property damage either, since the plaintiffs have failed to present sufficient proof that their houses and the industrial premises were damaged through the fault of the Ministry of the Interior.\\nThe only evidence the plaintiffs have produced to corroborate their claims is the certificate issued by the head of the local council of Bratskoye, which states that the federal interior troops caused the property damage. However, the court cannot consider this document as evidence, since the date of its issue is missing. Besides, there is nothing in this document to suggest that the real amount of the damage corresponds to that indicated by the plaintiffs.\\n...\\nThe plaintiffs have adduced photographs of their houses and industrial premises. The court cannot admit these photographs in evidence, since there is no indication that they represent the plaintiffs' houses and industrial premises.\\nIn view of the fact that during the trial the plaintiffs' arguments that it was the Ministry of the Interior which adversely occupied their property have proved groundless, the court finds the Khamidovs' claims unfounded.”\", \"51.  The court rejected the applicant's claims accordingly, without separately addressing his claims regarding compensation for the adverse occupation of his estate or that in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\", \"52.  The applicant appealed against the above-mentioned judgment. He pointed out, among other things, that the District Court's finding to the effect that “during the trial the plaintiffs' arguments that the Ministry of the Interior unlawfully occupied their property had proved groundless” was arbitrary and contravened Article 55 of the Code of Civil Procedure which stated that the facts established by a court judgment that had entered into force should not have to be proved again during examination of other civil disputes between the same parties. The applicant also claimed that the District Court had been arbitrary in that it had rejected the certificate drawn up by the commission consisting of the head of the local council and residents of Bratskoye by merely referring to the fact that this certificate was undated, even though the said document directly referred to the evaluation reports of 26 May 2000 that had been enclosed with it and submitted to the first-instance court.\", \"53.  On 8 April 2002 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. It restated, in essence, the reasoning of the first-instance judgment and confirmed that all the findings had been correct.\", \"54.  The applicant's subsequent requests for supervisory review were to no avail.\", '55.  Among a considerable number of other documents, the applicants submitted the following.\\n(a)  Documents relating to the title to the property', \"56.  Registration certificates nos. 322 and 323 issued on 18 October 2000 by a competent local authority in respect of the applicant's house and that of his brother confirm that the houses belong to the applicant and his brother respectively.\", '57.  A temporary registration certificate of 5 September 1996 issued by a competent authority confirms the transfer of the plot of land of 1.5 hectares to the Nedra company under an indefinite lease.', '58.  Certified technical descriptions issued to the applicant and his brother for their respective houses and to the Nedra company in respect of the industrial premises indicate the surface area of the buildings (see paragraph 10 above) and contain a plan of the buildings showing their dimensions.\\n(b)  Documents relating to the status of the Nedra company', \"59.  The Charter of the Nedra company was approved by its founders on 22 March 1996 and registered with the Chechen Ministry of Justice on 3 April 1996 under number 3398. It states that the multifunctional firm Nedra is a limited liability company and a legal entity. The founders of the company are the applicant and his brother. The Charter stipulates that the founders are the company's owners and that in case of their death the right of ownership shall be transferred to their heirs. The liability of the founders for the company's debts is limited to the amount of their shares. They are empowered to appoint the director of the company.\", \"60.  Certificate no. 3398 issued by the Chechen Ministry of Justice on 3 April 1996 confirms the registration of the Nedra company on the same date. The certificate states that Nedra is a private company, indicates the company's registered address and the amount of the charter capital and states that the company's “director (founder) is Mr Dzhabrail Abulkhanovich Khamidov”, the applicant's brother.\", \"61.  Certificate no. 273 of 16 August 2000 confirms that the Nedra company was re-registered on the same date. It states that Nedra is a private company, indicates the company's registered address and the amount of the charter capital and states that the company's “director (founder) is Mr Dzhabrail Abulkhanovich Khamidov”.\", '62.  Extract no. 602a of 1 December 2006 from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities provides a very detailed account regarding the Nedra company, stating, in particular, that “the founders (owners) of the company are two natural persons”, namely the applicant and his brother.\\n(c)  Documents certifying damage to the property', \"63.  The applicants submitted four evaluation reports issued in the presence of the applicant and his brother on 26 May 2000 by a commission composed of the deputy head of the commission, Mr I., the head of the local council of Bratskoye, Mr T., a representative of the planning organisation, Mr M., and a representative of the building organisation, Mr Ib. The reports are countersigned by the military commander of the Nadterechny District, General-Major K., and the head of the administration of the Nadterechny District, Mr Z. The reports are issued in respect of the applicant's house, his brother's house, the storage facility and the industrial equipment and state that each item of the property in question has been damaged and that its restoration requires a certain amount of work as listed below.\", \"64.  The report issued in respect of the applicant's house lists the following types of work:\", \"65.  The report issued in respect of the house belonging to the applicant's brother lists the following work:\", '66.  As regards the storage facility the report lists at the outset three types of necessary work revealing that the roof was destroyed completely. The report continues as follows:', '67.  The report issued with respect to the industrial equipment states that the mill machinery and the mini-bakery had been disassembled completely.', \"68.  The applicant submitted three bailiff's reports on the eviction of the police units dated 30 July 2001 (see paragraph 43 above). The reports were drawn up in respect of the applicant's house, his brother's house and the industrial equipment and premises, in the presence of the applicant, his brother and two attesting witnesses. They are signed by the applicant, the bailiff and the witnesses. The reports list the items of the applicant's property that were destroyed or damaged and indicate the degree of damage caused.\", \"69.  The report relating to the applicant's house provides the following details:\", \"70.  The report drawn up in respect of the house of the applicant's brother lists damage as follows:\", '71.  The report drawn up in respect of the industrial equipment and premises states as follows:', \"72.  The report of 14 June 2002 states that the police units were evicted from “[the applicant's] private house and the Nedra company's premises”. The state of the house is described as follows:\", \"73.  The Government did not furnish the Court with any documents before the admissibility decision was taken. After the case was declared admissible the Government submitted a number of documents, including certificate no. 3398 of 3 April 1996 (see paragraph 60 above), a temporary registration certificate of 5 September 1996 (see paragraph 57), a decision of 4 January 2000 taken by the applicant's brother to re-register the Nedra company in accordance with the Russian legislation in force and to appoint the applicant as the company's director, an evaluation report of 26 May 2000 issued in respect of the storage facility (see paragraph 66), certificate no. 273 of 16 August 2000 (see paragraph 61), registration certificate no. 322 of 18 October 2000 (see paragraph 56) and extract no. 10123 of 17 January 2007 from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities which provides information identical to that contained in extract no. 602a (see paragraph 62).\", '74.  The other documents submitted by the Government may be summarised as follows.', '75.  A certificate of 12 January 2007 issued by a housing authority of the Nadterechny District states that the residential properties of the village of Bratskoye have never been included in a register for administration by the said housing authority and that the latter has no information as to whether the applicant and his brother have any housing.', \"76.  A written explanation given by Mr T., the head of the local council of Bratskoye, on 12 January 2007 states that the applicant and his brother used to live in Bratskoye but no longer reside there. According to Mr T., in 1995 the applicant was assigned a plot of land of 1.5 hectares for construction purposes and the applicant built a storage facility and two houses thereon. The explanation further states that in the period from 1997 to 1999 the applicant's estate was occupied by Chechen rebel fighters who had built quarters on the applicant's land and that in late 1999 they were replaced by federal police who remained on the estate until 2001 or 2002. In Mr T.'s submission, he does not remember the exact period during which various military structures were placed on the applicant's estate, and cannot indicate the legal basis for the occupation of the estate. According to him, “after the police units left, the situation on the estate was as it is now; there were only slight defects in the rooms of the house, which we reported when drawing up documents”. In his explanation Mr T. submits that he does not remember the date on which the said documents were drawn up, and that the local council of Bratskoye does not have these documents at its disposal.\", '77.  One of three certificates issued by Mr T., the head of the local council of Bratskoye, on 12 January 2007 states that the limited liability company Nedra situated on a plot of land of 1.5 hectares on the outskirts of Bratskoye is registered in the names of the applicant and his brother, but the latter two, themselves, are not registered in the village. The remaining two certificates state that the houses of the applicant and his brother respectively are not listed in the property register of the village of Bratskoye.', '78.  Two certificates issued by the State enterprise “Russian Real Estate Centre” on 12 January 2007 state that “as a result of military actions within the territory of the Chechen Republic the archive of the Chechen branch of the Russian Real Estate Centre was completely destroyed (burnt)” and that “according to the archive data since 27 April 2000, as at the date of 12 January 2007, there is no housing registered for the applicant and his brother respectively”.', '79.  The Government submitted a number of photographs taken on 12 January 2007 which represent two houses photographed from the outside and situated in close proximity to each other and a long construction with a missing roof and missing floor. Some photographs represent a partly broken fence made from concrete blocks. The Government did not make any comments regarding the photographs.', \"80.  The Government also submitted three undated evaluation reports drawn up in the applicant's presence by a commission comprising a technical expert, Mr I., a representative of the administration of the Nadterechny District, Mr Ib., and the head of the local council of Bratskoye, Mr T. The reports are countersigned by the deputy head of the administration of the Nadterechny District. They do not specify in respect of which particular building they are made, but contain a hand-drawn plan of the respective building and indicate the work required to restore the property.\", \"81.  One of the reports lists work very similar to that indicated in the evaluation report of 26 May 2000 issued in respect of the applicant's house (see paragraph 64 above):\", \"82.  Another report lists work very similar to that indicated in the evaluation report of 26 May 2000 issued in respect of the house of the applicant's brother (see paragraph 65 above), such as:\", '83.  The third report lists work very similar to that indicated in the evaluation report of 26 May 2000 issued in respect of the industrial premises (see paragraph 66 above). In particular, the first three types of work indicate that the roof of the respective building has been completely destroyed. The report further states as follows:', \"84.  Finally, the Government submitted written statements by eight police officers who were stationed on the applicant's estate at various times in 2000 – 2002. The statements were made in the period between 16 and 18 November 2004. Officer S. submitted that the property had been kept in the same condition in which it had been taken over; officers G. and Sh. stated that nothing had been plundered from the estate, and that the condition of the property had been assessed as being good at the time of its transfer to other police units. Five other officers submitted that they had been stationed in the quarters on the applicant's land plot, and that they had been unaware who had owned the property in question.\"], 'applicants': ['KHAMIDOV'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['13', 'P1-1', '8', '6', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['P1-1', '6', '8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'8': ['100', '157', '162', '169', '175', '49', '50', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '75', '77', '78', '79', '8', '80', '99'], '41': ['10', '121', '183', '49', '58', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72']}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 43, 44, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [2, 43, 44, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74], 'explained_indices': [2, 6, 0, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 48, 57, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 49, 58, 60, 41, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 59, 69, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 68, 40, 39, 38, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 77, 21, 20, 23, 37, 36, 35, 34, 22, 32, 31, 33, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 30, 78, 5, 4, 3, 1], 'explained_distances': [-0.009340823, -0.034368634, -0.047281325, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.062616765, -0.07707602, -0.0882138, -0.112394035, -0.114797175], 'number_of_sentences': 79, 'article_id': 11, 'fact': 'claimed_not_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The investigative authorities submitted the following account of events. The applicant’s father and V. were business partners. The applicant was well acquainted with V. and persuaded him to enter into a deal with R. R. then swindled V., causing him serious financial damage. V. suspected the applicant of collusion with R., and their relationship seriously deteriorated. The applicant then decided to arrange the murder of V. For this purpose, the applicant met D.K., who lived in Kyiv and offered to assist him in arranging the murder of V. The applicant wired money to D.K. to buy a gun.

At the same time he was apprised of Article 63 of the Constitution, which provides that a person is not liable for refusal to give evidence regarding himself or herself and his or her relatives.', '13.  During questioning the applicant admitted that he had asked D.K. to find someone who could murder V. in exchange for money. D.K. had answered in the affirmative and they had agreed a price and the terms. They later met in Kharkiv to inspect the locality. D.K. had taken part of the payment from the applicant. Subsequently, D.K. had been arrested and the plan to murder V. had fallen through.', '14.  After questioning, the applicant wrote a confession and submitted it to the police officer who had questioned him. According to the applicant, he wrote a confession, as dictated by a police officer, to avoid any further ill‑treatment.', '15.  At 1.05 p.m. on 21 November 2004 an investigator of the Shevchenkivskyy District Prosecutor’s Office of Kyiv questioned I. in the presence of her lawyer. I. admitted that she had helped D.K. to look for a gun and someone who could commit a contract murder. She had assisted him in approaching Yu.K. as a possible assassin. She further stated that she knew nothing about the applicant.', '16.  At 1.30 p.m. on 21 November 2004 the investigator, relying on Articles 106 and 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, issued an arrest report in respect of the applicant. According to the report, the applicant was arrested on the grounds that he had been identified by an eyewitness. The applicant was apprised of his procedural rights as a suspect.', '17.  At 1.50 p.m. on 21 November 2004 the investigator apprised the applicant of his rights under Article 63 of the Constitution and his right to have a lawyer. The applicant designated two lawyers who had been admitted to the proceedings: a legal aid lawyer provided by the investigator and N.B., hired by his father.', '18.  At 2 p.m. on 21 November 2004 the investigator questioned the applicant as a suspect. Before the questioning, the applicant’s rights under Article 63 of the Constitution were explained to him. The applicant was questioned in the presence of the legal aid lawyer. Lawyer N.B. was absent. During questioning the applicant gave details of his communication with D.K. and claimed that he had not taken any action with a view to arranging the murder of V.', '19.  On 22 November 2004 a confrontation between the applicant and the other suspect, D.K., was arranged with the assistance of the applicant’s legal aid lawyer. The applicant contended that he had not asked D.K. to arrange the murder; D.K. insisted that the applicant had asked him to do so.', '20.  On 24 November 2004 the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv extended the applicant’s preliminary detention to ten days.', '21.  On 25 November 2004 the investigator arranged confrontations between I. and D.K., and later between D.K. and Yu.K. Both I. and D.K. were assisted by lawyers.', '22.  On 30 November 2004 the applicant and I. were charged with the crime and questioned. According to the verbatim record, they were questioned at the same time.', '23.  On the same date the applicant was questioned in the presence of both of his lawyers. He maintained his previous statements of 21 November 2004 when he had been questioned as a suspect.', '24.  I. was also questioned in the presence of her lawyer. She stated that in September 2004 D.K. had approached her to help him find a gun. She had assisted him in looking for a gun, but to no avail. She had further arranged and participated in the meeting between D.K. and Yu.K. during which the former had explained that the latter’s task would be to “remove” a person living in Kharkiv. She had acted as an intermediary in passing money between D.K. and Yu.K.', '25.  On the same date, 30 November 2004, the Shevchenkivskyy District Court of Kyiv ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for two months.', '26.  On 21 December 2004 I. died in a road accident.', '27.  On 14 and 28 January 2005 the applicant was questioned in the absence of N.B. but in the presence of the legal aid lawyer. According to the verbatim record provided by the Government, while being questioned on 14 January 2005 the applicant had informed the investigator that his confession of 21 November 2004 had been obtained by means of ill‑treatment.', '28.   The trial of the applicant and D.K. commenced in March 2005 at the Kyiv Court of Appeal, acting as a first-instance court. Before the trial, the applicant dismissed N.B. and subsequently, on 28 March 2005, he also dismissed the legal aid lawyer and appointed another lawyer.', '29.  During the trial the applicant and D.K. denied the charges. The applicant insisted that his negotiations with D.K. and the other persons had not meant that he had wanted V. dead; his intention had been to make R. explain to V. that the applicant had not been involved in R.’s fraud.', '30.  The applicant further submitted that he had been arrested at 11 p.m. on 20 November 2004, taken to the police station in Kharkiv and then escorted to Kyiv. He alleged that police officers had hit him in the stomach with truncheons, placed a gas mask over his head and blocked his access to air, which had made it impossible to breathe, and that his hands had swelled because the handcuffs had been too tight. This treatment had resulted in his confessing to the crime.', '31.  D.K. asserted that after his arrest, the police officers had started to threaten him so he had simply given up and signed all the documents he had been told to sign. The court called his girlfriend as a witness. She stated that on 17 November 2004 she had also been taken to the police station together with D.K. On that day she had been questioned for six hours, during which the police officers had sworn and shouted at her, and threatened to rape her. After her release, she had gone to a doctor for examination.', '32.  When the court summoned the police officers, the applicant identified one police officer who had hit him in the stomach and another who had placed a gas mask over his head. D.K. identified the police officer who had abused him psychologically. The girlfriend of D.K. identified the police officer who had shouted at her and threatened to rape her. The police officers denied the allegations of psychological and physical ill-treatment. They admitted that they had arrested the applicant in Kharkiv and had taken him to Kyiv.', '33.  The court also questioned the investigator, who submitted that the applicant had made no complaints of ill-treatment and that the applicant had been assisted by the legal aid lawyer during questioning. In the investigator’s opinion, this had been sufficient to ensure the applicant’s defence rights.', '34.  On 25 June 2005 the court found the applicant guilty of attempting to arrange a murder and sentenced him to four and a half years’ imprisonment. The court also found that there had been no indication of a plan for the murder to be committed by a group of people and dismissed that part of the accusation.', '35.  The court based its findings on the applicant’s confession of 21 November 2004 and other self-incriminating statements given throughout the pre-trial investigation; the evidence provided by the co-defendant at the pre-trial investigation; and the witness evidence provided by Yu.K. and others during the pre-trial investigation and the trial. Given the fact that by the time the trial took place, I. had died, the court examined the statements that I. had made during the pre-trial investigation. The court also referred to the material evidence and the expert opinions.', '36.  The court rejected the argument of the defence that the applicant should have been regarded as having voluntarily refused to commit the crime. It found in this regard that the applicant had been prevented from committing the crime by the witness, Yu.K., who had informed the law-enforcement authorities that the crime was being arranged.', '37.  The court further dismissed the arguments of the defence that the evidence obtained by the investigation had been inadmissible. It noted that there had been no indication that the applicant had been unlawfully arrested and detained, or that he had been subjected to ill-treatment; neither had there been any violation of the applicant’s rights of defence. Those rights had been properly explained to him and he had been properly represented by lawyers during the investigation. The fact that the records of the applicant’s and I.’s questioning of 30 November 2004 indicated that they had been carried out at the same time did not compromise the validity of those two separate measures.', '38.  On 15 and 18 July the applicant’s lawyer submitted objections, which were included in the verbatim record of the hearings.', '39.  On 25 July 2005 the applicant’s lawyer appealed in cassation, claiming that the first-instance court had misinterpreted the facts; wrongly assessed the evidence; failed properly to examine the applicant’s submissions, including those concerning his unlawful detention and ill‑treatment and the violation of his defence rights; and unduly relied on I.’s statements.', '40.  On 2 February 2006 the Supreme Court held a hearing on the applicant’s case. After it had heard the parties to the proceedings, including the applicant and his lawyer, and examined the evidence in the case, the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as groundless. It referred to the available evidence, including the applicant’s confession of 21 November 2004, and found that the applicant’s guilt had been well established. It also found that the applicant had been arrested and detained lawfully, the police officers had not pressurised the applicant and his defence rights had not been impaired. It therefore upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in respect of the applicant.'], 'applicants': ['GRINENKO'], 'defendants': ['UKRAINE'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '5', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['10', '27', '30', '32', '33'], '5': ['44'], '6': ['15']}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 10, 22, 25, 27, 28], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [5, 10, 22, 25, 27, 28], 'explained_indices': [5, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 29, 21, 31, 32, 33, 28, 20, 17, 18, 34, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 19, 35], 'explained_distances': [0.09956014, 0.0944196, 0.08746921, 0.07296596, 0.06332897, 0.053170018, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454, -0.07505454], 'number_of_sentences': 36, 'article_id': 3, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1975 and is currently detained in Schwalmstadt Prison, Germany.', '10.  J. was the youngest son of a banking family in Frankfurt am Main. He got to know the applicant, a law student, as an acquaintance of his sister.', '11.  On 27 September 2002 the applicant lured J., aged 11, into his flat in Frankfurt am Main by pretending that the child’s sister had left a jacket there. He then killed the boy by suffocating him.', '12.  Subsequently, the applicant deposited a ransom note at J.’s parents’ place of residence stating that J. had been kidnapped and demanding one million euros. The note further stated that if the kidnappers received the ransom and managed to leave the country, then the child’s parents would see their son again. The applicant then drove to a pond located on a private property near Birstein, approximately one hour’s drive from Frankfurt, and hid J.’s corpse under a jetty.', '13.  On 30 September 2002 at around 1 a.m. the applicant picked up the ransom at a tram station. From then on he was under police surveillance. He paid part of the ransom money into his bank accounts and hid the remainder of the money in his flat. That afternoon, he was arrested at Frankfurt am Main airport with the police pinning him face down on the ground.', '14.  After having been examined by a doctor at the airport’s hospital on account of shock and skin lesions, the applicant was taken to the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters. He was informed by detective officer M. that he was suspected of having kidnapped J. and was instructed about his rights as a defendant, notably the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer. He was then questioned by M. with a view to finding J. Meanwhile, the police, having searched the applicant’s flat, found half of the ransom money and a note concerning the planning of the crime. The applicant intimated that the child was being held by another kidnapper. At 11.30 p.m. he was allowed to consult a lawyer, Z., for thirty minutes at his request. He subsequently indicated that F.R. and M.R. had kidnapped the boy and had hidden him in a hut by a lake.', '15.  Early in the morning of 1 October 2002, before M. came to work, Mr Daschner (“D.”), deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, ordered another officer, Mr Ennigkeit (“E.”), to threaten the applicant with considerable physical pain, and, if necessary, to subject him to such pain in order to make him reveal the boy’s whereabouts. D.’s subordinate heads of department had previously and repeatedly opposed such a measure (see also paragraph 47 below). Detective officer E. thereupon threatened the applicant with subjection to considerable pain at the hands of a person specially trained for such purposes if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. According to the applicant, the officer further threatened to lock him in a cell with two huge black men who would sexually abuse him. The officer also hit him several times on the chest with his hand and shook him so that, on one occasion, his head hit the wall. The Government disputed that the applicant had been threatened with sexual abuse or had been physically assaulted during the questioning.', '16.  For fear of being exposed to the measures he was threatened with, the applicant disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body after approximately ten minutes.', '17.  The applicant was then driven with M. and numerous other police officers to Birstein. He had refused to go with detective officer E. The police waited for a video camera to be brought to the scene. Then, the applicant, on the communicated order of the police officer in command and while being filmed, pointed out the precise location of the body. The police found J.’s corpse under the jetty at the pond near Birstein as indicated by the applicant. The applicant claimed that he had been obliged to walk without shoes through woods to where he had left the corpse and, on the orders of the police, he had had to point out its precise location. The Government disputed that the applicant had had to walk without shoes.', '18.  Upon forensic examination of the scene, the police discovered tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond near Birstein. Under questioning by detective officer M. on the return journey from Birstein the applicant confessed to having kidnapped and killed J. He was then taken by the police to various other locations indicated by him where they secured J.’s school exercise books, a backpack, J.’s clothes and a typewriter used for the blackmail letter in containers. An autopsy carried out on J.’s corpse on 2 October 2002 confirmed that J. had died of suffocation.', '19.  Having returned to the police station, the applicant was then permitted to consult his lawyer, En., who had been instructed to act on his behalf by his mother and who had tried, in vain, to contact and advise the applicant earlier that morning.', '20.  In a note for the police file dated 1 October 2002, the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., stated that he believed that that morning J.’s life had been in great danger, if he was still alive at all, given his lack of food and the temperature outside. In order to save the child’s life, he had therefore ordered the applicant to be threatened by detective officer E. with considerable pain which would not leave any trace of injury. He confirmed that the treatment itself was to be carried out under medical supervision. D. further admitted that he had ordered another police officer to obtain a “truth serum” to be administered to the applicant. According to the note, the threat to the applicant was exclusively aimed at saving the child’s life rather than furthering the criminal proceedings concerning the kidnapping. As the applicant had disclosed the whereabouts of J.’s body, having been threatened with pain, no measures had in fact been carried out.', '21.  A medical certificate issued by a police doctor on 4 October 2002 confirmed that the applicant had a haematoma (7 cm x 5 cm) below his left collarbone, skin lesions and blood scabs on his left arm and his knees and swellings on his feet. A further medical certificate dated 7 October 2002 noted that, following an examination of the applicant on 2 October 2002, two haematomas on the left-hand side of the applicant’s chest of a diameter of around 5 cm and 4 cm were confirmed, together with superficial skin lesions or blood scabs on his left arm, his knees and his right leg and closed blisters on his feet. According to the certificate, these discreet traces of injuries indicated that the injuries had been caused a few days before the examination. The precise cause of the injuries could not be diagnosed.', '22.  During subsequent questioning by the police on 4 October 2002, by a public prosecutor on 4, 14 and 17 October 2002, and by a district court judge on 30 January 2003 the applicant confirmed the confession he had made on 1 October 2002.', '23.  In January 2003 the Frankfurt am Main public prosecutor’s office opened criminal investigation proceedings against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations that he had been threatened on 1 October 2002. 1.  The proceedings in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court\\n(a)  The preliminary applications concerning the discontinuation of the proceedings and the inadmissibility of evidence', '24.  On 9 April 2003, the first day of the hearing, the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a preliminary application for the proceedings to be discontinued. The basis of his claim was that during interrogation and prior to confessing he had been threatened by detective officer E. with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse. He argued that this treatment had been in breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 61 below) and Article 3 of the Convention and warranted the discontinuation of the proceedings against him.', '25.  The applicant also lodged an alternative preliminary application seeking a declaration that, owing to the continuous effect (Fortwirkung) of the threat of violence against him on 1 October 2002, all statements which he had made to the investigation authorities should not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings. Moreover, the applicant sought a declaration that on account of the violation of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the confession extracted – the so-called “fruit of the poisonous tree” – was prohibited (Fernwirkung).', '26.  On 9 April 2003, in response to the first preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings. The court noted that in the applicant’s submission, detective officer E. had threatened that a specialist was on his way to the police station by helicopter who, without leaving any traces, would inflict on him intolerable pain the likes of which he had never before experienced, if he continued to refuse to disclose J.’s whereabouts. To underpin the threat, E. had imitated the sound of the rotating blades of a helicopter. E. had further threatened that the applicant would be locked up in a cell with two big “Negroes” who would anally assault him. He would wish that he had never been born. The court found as a fact that the applicant had been threatened with the infliction of considerable pain if he refused to disclose the victim’s whereabouts. However, the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced. The threat to inflict pain upon the applicant had been illegal pursuant to Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and also pursuant to Article 1 and Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law (see paragraphs 59-60 below) and in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.', '27.  However, notwithstanding this breach of the applicant’s constitutional rights, the court found that the criminal proceedings were not, in consequence, barred and could proceed. It found that the use of the investigation methods in question, though prohibited in law, had not so restricted the rights of the defence that the criminal proceedings could not be pursued. In view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant on the one hand, and the severity of the unlawful conduct during investigation on the other, there had not been such an exceptional and intolerable violation of the rule of law as to bar the continuation of the criminal proceedings.', '28.  In response to the applicant’s second preliminary application, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court found that, in accordance with Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all confessions and statements hitherto made by the applicant before the police, a public prosecutor and a district court judge were inadmissible as evidence in the criminal proceedings because they had been obtained through the use of prohibited methods of interrogation.', '29.  The court found that on 1 October 2002 detective officer E. had used prohibited methods of interrogation within the meaning of Article 136a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by threatening the applicant with intolerable pain if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. Therefore, any statements which the applicant had made as a consequence of this forbidden investigative measure were inadmissible as evidence. This exclusion of evidence (Beweisverwertungsverbot) did not only comprise the statements made immediately after the unlawful threat. It covered all further statements which the applicant had made to the investigation authorities since that date in view of the continuous effect of the violation of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '30.  The procedural irregularity caused by the use of a prohibited method of investigation could only have been remedied if the applicant had been informed before his subsequent questioning that his earlier statements made as a consequence of the threat of pain could not be used as evidence against him. However, the applicant had only been instructed about his right not to testify, without having been informed about the inadmissibility of the evidence that had been improperly obtained. He had therefore not been given the necessary “qualified instruction” (qualifizierte Belehrung) before making further statements.', '31.  However, the court limited the inadmissible evidence to the above-mentioned statements. It went on to dismiss the applicant’s application for a declaration that, on account of the prohibited investigation methods, the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities as a consequence of the statements extracted from the applicant ought to be excluded from trial (Fernwirkung). The court found as follows:\\n“... there is no long-range effect of the breach of Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure meaning that the items of evidence which have become known as a result of the statement may likewise not be used [as evidence]. The Chamber agrees in this respect with the conciliatory view (Mittelmeinung) taken by scholars and in court rulings ... according to which a balancing [of interests] in the particular circumstances of the case had to be carried out, taking into account, in particular, whether there had been a flagrant violation of the legal order, notably of provisions on fundamental rights, and according to which the seriousness of the offence investigated also had to be considered. Balancing the severity of the interference with the defendant’s fundamental rights – in the present case the threat of physical violence – and the seriousness of the offence he was charged with and which had to be investigated – the completed murder of a child – makes the exclusion of evidence which has become known as a result of the defendant’s statement – in particular the discovery of the dead child and the results of the autopsy – appear disproportionate.”\\n(b)  The Regional Court’s judgment', '32.  Following the above ruling on the applicant’s preliminary applications lodged on the opening day of the trial, the proceedings continued. The next day, in his statement on the charges, the applicant admitted having killed J., but stated that he had not initially intended to do so. His defence counsel submitted that by confessing, the applicant wanted to take responsibility for his offence notwithstanding the interrogation methods used on 1 October 2002. As the trial proceeded, all further items of evidence found as a consequence of the applicant’s original statement and which the applicant sought to have excluded were adduced. At the close of the trial on 28 July 2003 the applicant admitted that he had also intended from the outset to kill the child. He described his second confession as “the only way to accept his deep guilt” and as the “greatest possible apology for the murder of the child”.', '33.  On 28 July 2003 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court convicted the applicant, inter alia, of murder and kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. It sentenced him to life imprisonment and declared that his guilt was of particular gravity, warranting a maximum sentence (see paragraph 63 below).', '34.  The court found that at the hearing the applicant had been instructed anew about his right to remain silent and about the fact that none of his earlier statements could be used as evidence against him and had thereby been given the necessary qualified instruction. However, the applicant had, following the qualified instruction, confessed that he had kidnapped and killed J. His statements at the trial concerning the planning of his offence formed the essential, if not the only, basis for the court’s findings of fact. They were corroborated by the testimony of J.’s sister, the blackmail letter and the note concerning the planning of the crime found in the applicant’s flat. The findings of fact concerning the execution of the crime were exclusively based on the applicant’s confession at the trial. Further items of evidence showed that he had told the truth also in this respect. These included the findings of the autopsy as to the cause of the child’s death, the tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car near the pond where the child’s corpse had been found, and the discovery of money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts.', '35.  In assessing the gravity of the applicant’s guilt, the court observed that he had killed his 11-year-old victim and demanded one million euros in ransom in order to preserve his self-created image of a rich and successful young lawyer. It did not share the views expressed by the public prosecutor’s office and the private accessory prosecutors that the applicant’s confession “was worth nothing” as the applicant had only confessed to what had in any event already been proven. The fact that the applicant had volunteered a full confession at the trial, even though all his earlier confessions could not be used as evidence pursuant to Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was a mitigating factor. However, even without his confession, the applicant would have been found guilty of kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim. The applicant had been kept under police surveillance after he had collected the ransom, which had later been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. Furthermore, it had been proved by the autopsy on J.’s corpse that the boy had been suffocated, and tyre tracks left by the applicant’s car had been detected at the place where J.’s body had been found.', '36.  The court further observed that in questioning the applicant, methods of interrogation prohibited under Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been employed. Whether and to what extent detective officer E. and the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., were guilty of an offence because of these threats had to be determined in the criminal investigations then pending against them. However, their allegedly illegal acts did not mitigate the applicant’s own guilt. The misconduct of police officers, belonging to the executive power, could not prevent the judiciary from assessing findings of fact in accordance with the law.', '37.  On the day following his conviction, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Federal Court of Justice. He complained that the Regional Court, in its decision of 9 April 2003, had refused his preliminary application to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him. It had further refused to declare that the use in the criminal proceedings of all other items of evidence, such as the child’s corpse, which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements unlawfully extracted was prohibited. The applicant included a full copy of these applications of 9 April 2003, including the grounds given for them. He further included a copy of the Regional Court’s decision of 9 April 2003 dismissing his application for the proceedings to be discontinued and argued in respect of the police’s threats of torture against him that, developing the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, such conduct “leapt beyond” the exclusion of evidence and led to an impediment to the proceedings (dass ein derartiges Verhalten das Verwertungsverbot “überspringt” und ein Verfahrenshindernis begründet).', '38.  In his observations dated 9 March 2004 the Federal Public Prosecutor objected that the applicant’s appeal on points of law was manifestly ill-founded. He argued that the use of prohibited methods of interrogation did not lead to an impediment to the criminal proceedings. Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly provided that the use of any of the prohibited methods enumerated entailed only the exclusion of evidence. The applicant had not complained of a breach of Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In any event, there would be no grounds for such a complaint as the Regional Court had only used the applicant’s confession at the trial, which he had made after having been informed that his previous statements had not been admitted as evidence.', '39.  On 21 May 2004 the Federal Court of Justice, without giving further reasons, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded.', '40.  On 23 June 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. Summarising the facts underlying the case and the content of the impugned decisions, he complained under Article 1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law about the way in which he had been questioned by the police on the morning of 1 October 2002. He argued that he had been threatened with being subjected to torture and sexual abuse if he did not disclose the child’s whereabouts. In the circumstances of the case, this treatment amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention and infringed Article 104 § 1 of the Basic Law. It also violated his absolute right to human dignity under Article 1 of the Basic Law, which lay at the heart of the provisions in question. These unjustifiable human rights violations ought to have been a bar to the criminal proceedings for murder and a prohibition on using the evidence obtained as a consequence of the confession extracted from him by means of prohibited measures.', '41.  On 14 December 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, held that the applicant’s constitutional complaint was inadmissible.', '42.  Firstly, in so far as the applicant complained of the failure of the criminal courts to discontinue the proceedings against him, the court found that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint. It observed that the Regional Court had already stated that the police’s threat to inflict pain on the applicant had violated Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 3 of the Convention and that the applicant’s rights under Article 1 § 1 and Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law had been disregarded.', '43.  However, the violation of fundamental rights outside the trial did not necessarily warrant the conclusion that the judgment delivered by a criminal court, which was based on the findings made during the trial, breached constitutional law. In the present case, the criminal courts had found that the methods of investigation used by the police had been prohibited, but had differed from the applicant as to the legal consequences that flowed from that finding. They had taken the view that the statements obtained as a result of the measures in question could not be used but that there was no bar to the specific criminal proceedings being pursued.', '44.  According to the Federal Constitutional Court, the procedural flaw of having used prohibited investigation measures could be regarded as having been remedied by the criminal courts, because they had prohibited the admission of the statements obtained thereby. Such a prohibition was prescribed by Article 136a § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to compensate for a prior infringement of the rights of the person concerned. However, the circumstances in which substantial procedural irregularities might entail a bar to criminal proceedings were not laid down in law. In these circumstances, the applicant had failed to explain why the contested methods of investigation had not only required a prohibition on using the statements obtained thereby as evidence, but should also lead to a bar to criminal proceedings against him.', '45.  Secondly, the Federal Constitutional Court found that, in so far as the applicant complained that the Regional Court had refused to exclude the use in the proceedings of all items of evidence obtained as a result of the confession extracted under duress, his constitutional complaint was likewise inadmissible. It held that the applicant had failed to raise this issue in the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice.', '46.  The decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 22 December 2004.', '47.  On 20 December 2004 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court delivered judgments against the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., and detective officer E. The court found that on the morning of 1 October 2002 D. had ordered that the applicant was to be questioned while being subjected to pain in the manner set out in his subsequent note for the police file (see paragraph 20 above). By doing so, he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into J.’s kidnapping. The heads of department had opposed this measure, which D. had previously ordered on the evening of 30 September 2002 and then twice on the morning of 1 October 2002. The heads of department had resisted the orders, proposing instead further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with J.’s family. D. had then issued an order to detective officer E. directing him to comply with his instructions that the applicant should be threatened with torture and, if necessary, subjected thereto. The subjection to pain was to be carried out under medical supervision, without any traces being left, by another specially trained police officer, who would be brought to the police station by helicopter. A police doctor had agreed to supervise the execution of D.’s order. The court noted that the measure had been aimed at finding out where the applicant had hidden J., whose life D. believed was at great risk. Therefore, E. had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by D. and had also informed him that a “truth serum” would be administered. After approximately ten minutes, the applicant confessed that he had hidden J.’s body under a jetty at a pond near Birstein.', '48.  The Regional Court observed that the method of investigation had not been justified. It rejected the defence of “necessity” because the method in question violated human dignity, as codified in Article 1 of the Basic Law. Respect for human dignity also lay at the heart of Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law and Article 3 of the Convention. The protection of human dignity was absolute, allowing of no exceptions or any balancing of interests.', '49.  The Frankfurt am Main Regional Court convicted detective officer E. of coercion committed by an official in the course of his duties. However, in terms of penalty, it cautioned the defendant and imposed a suspended fine of 60 euros (EUR) per diem for 60 days, which the defendant would be required to pay if he committed another offence during the probation period. Furthermore, the court convicted the deputy chief of the Frankfurt police, D., of having incited E., a subordinate, to commit coercion in the course of his duties. It also cautioned D. and imposed on him a suspended fine of EUR 120 per diem for 90 days. The applicant had given evidence as a witness in these proceedings.', '50.  In determining the sentences, the Regional Court considered that there were significant mitigating factors to be taken into account. It took into consideration that the defendants’ sole concern had been to save J.’s life and that they had been under extreme pressure because of their respective responsibilities vis-à-vis the superior authority and the public. They had been exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation. They did not have any previous convictions. Moreover, D. had taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on the same day. The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention. The defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career: D. had been transferred to the Hessian Ministry of the Interior, and E. had been prohibited from acting in the prosecution of criminal offences. Furthermore, it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the defendants’ case had been assessed by a German criminal court. The court took into consideration as aggravating factors that D. had not acted spontaneously as he had already directed the use of force on the evening before he had given the order to E. Moreover, by their acts, the defendants had risked compromising the applicant’s conviction for murder. The court further found that the preservation of the legal order did not warrant the enforcement of the fines imposed. Through the defendants’ criminal conviction it had been made clear that an order by a State agent to use force to obtain information was illegal.', '51.  The judgment became final on 20 December 2004.', '52.  Subsequently, D. was appointed chief of the Police Headquarters for Technology, Logistics and Administration.', '53.  On 28 December 2005 the applicant applied to the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court for legal aid for bringing official liability proceedings against the Land of Hesse for the payment of compensation. He claimed that he had been traumatised and in need of psychological treatment because of the methods deployed during the police investigation.', '54.  In its submissions dated 27 March 2006 the Frankfurt am Main police headquarters contested that E.’s conduct when questioning the applicant in the morning of 1 October 2002 was to be legally classified as coercion and amounted to a breach of official duties.', '55.  On 28 August 2006 the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for legal aid and the applicant appealed.', '56.  On 28 February 2007 the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. Endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, it confirmed, in particular, that police officers D. and E., when threatening the applicant, had infringed human dignity, which was inviolable, and had thus breached their official duties. However, the applicant would face difficulties establishing causation between the threats of torture and alleged mental damage allegedly necessitating psychological treatment. The officers’ threat was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact of having killed a child. Moreover, even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that detective officer E. had shaken him, causing him to hit his head against a wall, or had once hit him on the chest, allegedly causing a haematoma, such physical damage would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation. Furthermore, the violation of his human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation since the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction for this by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers.', '57.  On 19 January 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court, allowing a constitutional complaint by the applicant, quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision and remitted the case to that court. It found that in refusing to grant the applicant legal aid, the Court of Appeal had violated the principle of equal access to court. In particular, that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage. In addition to that, it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation, during which he had been handcuffed, could be considered to be of minor importance. Moreover, the question whether the violation of the applicant’s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had already obtained was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance. It should, therefore, not be determined in an application for legal-aid proceedings.', '58.  The remitted proceedings are still pending before the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court.', '59.  Article 1 § 1 of the Basic Law, on the protection of human dignity, reads as follows:\\n“Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all State authorities.”', '60.  Article 104 § 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law, on the rights of persons in detention, provides:\\n“Persons taken into custody may not be subjected to mental or to physical ill-treatment.”', '61.  Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on prohibited methods of interrogation (verbotene Vernehmungsmethoden), provides:\\n“1.  The freedom of the accused to make decisions and to manifest his will shall not be impaired by ill-treatment, induced fatigue, physical interference, the administration of drugs, torment, deception or hypnosis. Coercion may be used only in so far as it is permitted by the law on criminal procedure. Threatening the accused with measures that are not permitted under the law on criminal procedure or holding out the prospect of an advantage that is not contemplated by statute shall be prohibited. 2.  Measures which impair the accused’s memory or ability to understand and accept a given situation [Einsichtsfähigkeit] shall not be permitted. 3.  The prohibition under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply even if the accused has consented [to the proposed measure]. Statements obtained in breach of this prohibition shall not be used [in evidence], even if the accused has agreed to their use.”', '62.  According to Article 211 of the Criminal Code, the intentional killing of a person is to be classified as murder if certain aggravating elements are present such as cupidity, treachery or intent to cover up another offence. Murder is punishable by life imprisonment.', '63.  A declaration by the sentencing court that the defendant’s guilt is of a particular gravity may, inter alia, have a bearing on a subsequent decision regarding suspension of the latter part of the defendant’s prison sentence on probation. Article 57a of the Criminal Code states that the court is to suspend the remainder of a life sentence on probation if the convicted person has served fifteen years of his sentence, provided that this can be justified in the interests of public security and the particular gravity of the defendant’s guilt does not warrant the continued execution of the sentence.', '64.  The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the United Nations Convention against Torture”), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1984 (Resolution 39/46) and which came into force on 26 June 1987, provides:\\nArticle 1\\n“1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.\\n...”\\nArticle 15\\n“Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.”\\nArticle 16\\n“1.  Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in Article 1, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\n...”', '65.  Several institutions which monitor observance of the prohibition of torture and of other inhuman or degrading treatment have addressed the question of the scope of that prohibition in the context of threats of subjecting a person to physical harm.', '66.  The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in its judgment of 27 November 2003 (Merits, Reparations and Costs) in the case of Maritza Urrutia v. Guatemala (Series C No. 103), found:\\n“85.  With regard to the treatment that the State officials afforded to Maritza Urrutia while she was unlawfully and arbitrarily detained, the court has considered proven that the alleged victim’s head was covered by a hood, she was kept handcuffed to a bed, in a room with the light on and the radio at full volume, which prevented her from sleeping. In addition, she was subjected to very prolonged interrogations, during which she was shown photographs of individuals who showed signs of torture or had been killed in combat and she was threatened that she would be found by her family in the same way. The State agents also threatened to torture her physically or to kill her or members of her family if she did not collaborate. To this end, they showed her photographs of herself and her family and correspondence from her to her former husband ... Lastly, Maritza Urrutia was obliged to film a video, which was subsequently broadcast by two Guatemalan television channels, in which she made a statement against her will, the contents of which she was forced to ratify at a press conference held after her release ... 92.  An international juridical regime of absolute prohibition of all forms of torture, both physical and psychological, has been developed and, with regard to the latter, it has been recognised that the threat or real danger of subjecting a person to physical harm produces, under determined circumstances, such a degree of moral anguish that it may be considered ‘psychological torture’. ...\\n... 98.  In light of the foregoing, the court declares that the State violated Article 5 of the American Convention [on Human Rights], in relation to Article 1 § 1 thereof, and the obligations established in Articles 1 and 6 of the Inter-American Convention against Torture, to the detriment of Maritza Urrutia.”', '67.  The United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights found in his report of 3 July 2001 to the General Assembly on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (UN Doc. A/56/156) as follows:\\n“As stated by the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No. 20 (10 April 1992), on Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind governments that the prohibition of torture relates not only to acts that cause physical pain but also to acts that cause mental suffering to the victim, such as intimidation and other forms of threats.” (paragraph 3)\\nHe pointed out that “the fear of physical torture may itself constitute mental torture” (paragraph 7). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was of the opinion that:\\n“... serious and credible threats, including death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even to torture, especially when the victim remains in the hands of law enforcement officials.” (paragraph 8)', '68.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in its Views adopted on 29 March 1983 in the case of Estrella v. Uruguay (Communication No. 74/1980), found as follows regarding the author of the communication, a concert pianist:\\n“The author was subjected to severe physical and psychological torture, including the threat that the author’s hands would be cut off by an electric saw, in an effort to force him to admit subversive activities.” (paragraph 8.3)\\nThe Human Rights Committee held that the author had been subjected to torture in violation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (paragraph 10). 2.  The admission of evidence procured as a result of torture or other prohibited ill-treatment: the exclusionary rule\\n(a)  The States Parties to the Convention', '69.  Materials before the Court show that there is no clear consensus in the States Parties to the Convention on the scope of the exclusionary rule.\\n(b)  Other human rights monitoring bodies', '70.  The United Nations Human Rights Committee stated in its General Comment No. 7 on torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7 of the ICCPR) of 30 May 1982:\\n“1.  ... it follows from Article 7, read together with Article 2 of the Covenant, that States must ensure an effective protection through some machinery of control. Complaints about ill-treatment must be investigated effectively by competent authorities. Those found guilty must be held responsible, and the alleged victims must themselves have effective remedies at their disposal, including the right to obtain compensation. Among the safeguards which may make control effective are ... provisions making confessions or other evidence obtained through torture or other treatment contrary to Article 7 inadmissible in court; ...”', '71.  General Comment No. 7 was replaced by General Comment No. 20 concerning prohibition of torture and cruel treatment or punishment of 10 March 1992. In the latter, it is stated:\\n“12.  It is important for the discouragement of violations under Article 7 that the law must prohibit the use of admissibility in judicial proceedings of statements or confessions obtained through torture or other prohibited treatment.”', '72.  The United Nations Committee against Torture, which monitors the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, stated in its Concluding Observations on Germany of 11 May 1998 (UN Doc. A/53/44) as follows:\\n“The Committee recommends that further legislative attention be paid to the strict enforcement of Article 15 of the Convention and that all evidence obtained directly or indirectly by torture be strictly prevented from reaching the cognisance of the deciding judges in all judicial proceedings.” (paragraph 193)\\n(c)  Case-law of the courts of other States', '73.  The prohibition on using, in any manner prejudicial to the accused, information derived from facts learned as a result of the unlawful acts of State agents (the so-called doctrine of the “fruit of the poisonous tree”) is firmly rooted in the legal tradition of the United States of America (see, for instance, US Supreme Court, no. 82-1651, Nix v. Williams, decision of 11 June 1984, 467 US 431 (1984), pp. 441 et seq.; US Supreme Court, no. 82-5298, Segura v. United States, decision of 5 July 1984, 468 US 796 (1984), pp. 796-97 and 815; and US Supreme Court, no. 07-513, Herring v. United States, decision of 14 January 2009, 555 US ... (2009), part II. A., with further references). The prohibition applies to information obtained from coerced confessions (see, on the issue of coercion, US Supreme Court, no. 50, Blackburn v. Alabama, decision of 11 January 1960, 361 US 199 (1960), pp. 205-07, and US Supreme Court, no. 8, Townsend v. Sain, decision of 18 March 1963, 372 US 293 (1963), pp. 293 and 307-09), meaning that if the confession leads to additional evidence, such evidence is also inadmissible in court in addition to the confession itself (compare Nix, cited above, p. 441, and Segura, cited above, p. 804). The evidence is to be excluded, however, only if the illegality is the proximate cause of the discovery of the evidence. In other words, evidence will be excluded if it can be shown that “but for” the illegal conduct it would not have been found. The exclusionary rule does not apply where the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery of the evidence is so remote as to dissipate the taint. This is the case, for example, where the police relied on an independent source to find the evidence (see Nix, cited above, pp. 441-44, and Segura, cited above, pp. 796-97, 804-05 and 815, with further references) or where the evidence would ultimately or inevitably have been discovered even had no violation of any constitutional provision taken place (see Nix, cited above, pp. 441-44).', '74.  The exclusionary rule is also applied in other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa found in its recent judgment of 10 April 2008 in the case of Mthembu v. The State, case no. 379/2007, [2008] ZASCA 51 as follows:\\n“Summary: The evidence of an accomplice extracted through torture (including real evidence derived from it) is inadmissible ...\\n... 33.  ... The Hilux and the metal box were real evidence critical to the State’s case against the appellant on the robbery counts. Ordinarily, as I have mentioned, such evidence would not be excluded because it exists independently of any constitutional violation. But these discoveries were made as [a] result of the police having tortured Ramseroop. There is no suggestion that the discoveries would have been made in any event. If they had the outcome of this case might have been different. 34.  Ramseroop made his statement to the police immediately after the metal box was discovered at his home following his torture. That his subsequent testimony was given apparently voluntarily does not detract from the fact that the information contained in that statement pertaining to the Hilux and metal box was extracted through torture. ... therefore, there is an inextricable link between his torture and the nature of the evidence that was tendered in court. The torture has stained the evidence irredeemably.\\n... 36.  To admit Ramseroop’s testimony regarding the Hilux and metal box would require us to shut our eyes to the manner in which the police obtained this information from him. More seriously, it is tantamount to involving the judicial process in ‘moral defilement’. This ‘would compromise the integrity of the judicial process (and) dishonour the administration of justice’. In the long term, the admission of torture-induced evidence can only have a corrosive effect on the criminal justice system. The public interest, in my view, demands its exclusion, irrespective of whether such evidence has an impact on the fairness of the trial.'], 'applicants': ['GÄFGEN'], 'defendants': ['GERMANY'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6', '3', '34'], 'violated_articles': ['3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['100', '101', '102', '103', '104', '105', '106', '107', '108', '116', '117', '118', '119', '13', '14', '17', '20', '21', '23', '26', '42', '47', '48', '50', '52', '57', '64', '66', '67', '68', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98', '99'], '6': ['108', '144', '165', '166', '167', '168', '24', '25', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '34', '35', '37', '40', '42', '43', '44', '64', '70', '73', '74', '84', '85', '86', '99']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41, 43, 48, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61, 64, 65], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41, 43, 48, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61, 64, 65], 'explained_indices': [4, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 40, 41, 48, 39, 38, 37, 42, 49, 52, 51, 36, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 50, 35, 32, 33, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 34, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 64, 20, 65, 13], 'explained_distances': [-0.03173983, -0.04134044, -0.041622996, -0.09528872, -0.11229524, -0.16935393, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334101, -0.23334107], 'number_of_sentences': 66, 'article_id': 5, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

As regards the other claims, it decided to leave them without examination, for they had already been adjudicated on 27 December 2000 and 8 June 2001 (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above).', '13.  On 6 June 2005 the Court of Appeal quashed the above judgment, because it had been delivered in the applicant’s absence and without his knowledge, and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh examination.', '14.  On 23 June 2005 the Podilskyy Court sent the file to the Shevchenkivskyy Court on the latter’s request. It was required for the examination of the applicant’s request for re-opening of the reinstatement proceedings (see paragraph 8 above).', '15.  On 24 June 2005 the Podilskyy Court stayed the proceedings until the file would be returned.', '16.  On 4 October 2005 the judge rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal against the aforementioned decision. That ruling was, by mistake, not sent to the applicant, until November 2008.', '17.  On 28 March 2008 the Podilskyy Court resumed the proceedings.', '18.  On 10 June 2008 it adjourned the hearing till 25 June 2008 because of the unspecified misbehaviour of the applicant’s representative. The court also decided that the applicant’s presence was obligatory.', '19.  On 25 June 2008 the applicant did not appear at the hearing, and the Podilskyy Court again adjourned it till 8 July 2008.', '20.  On 24 November 2008 it dismissed the claim without examination on merits for the applicant’s repeated failure to attend hearings.', '21.  On 25 August 2004 the applicant brought another claim to the Shevchenkivskyy Court against the factory in respect of salary recovery, this time confined to two specific days.', '22.  On 16 August 2005 the court terminated the proceedings given that this claim had already been examined by the courts as a part of the applicant’s another claim. On 27 December 2005 and 17 May 2006 the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court respectively upheld that ruling.', '23.  On 24 April 2008 the applicant supplemented his claim regarding the disability allowance with an additional complaint regarding the alleged conspiracy of the factory’s administration and trade union again him.', '24.  On 2 June 2008 the Podilskyy Court decided to refer the applicant’s claim in that part to the Shevchenkivskyy Court for examination. The applicant unsuccessfully challenged that referral before higher-level courts.', '25.  On 9 June 2009 the Shevchenkivskyy Court started the proceedings.

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Chişinău. During the 1990s she became well known in business circles in Moldova and was designated “Business person of the year” in 1999.', '6.  During 1999-2001 the applicant borrowed money from four individuals, to a total amount of 894,955 Moldovan lei (MDL), (approximately 79,000 euros (EUR) at the time). She told her creditors that she would use the money to import cosmetic products from a French company to sell in her cosmetics shop in Chişinău. However, she did not repay the money and interest within the time-limits agreed with her creditors. The applicant submitted that she had repaid part of her debt before the proceedings against her were initiated and that the delay in repaying the debt was due to delays in importing the cosmetic products to Moldova. It is not disputed by the parties that the applicant never denied the existence of her debts and that she confirmed them in writing and before the authorities during the criminal proceedings.', '7.  Following criminal complaints by the creditors, on 11 November 2002 a criminal investigation was initiated against the applicant. She was accused of obtaining the money fraudulently, without any intention of repaying it. According to the applicant, a person with influence over one of her creditors wanted to obtain a contract with the French company and threatened her with imprisonment if she refused to transfer her business with that company to him. The criminal proceedings against her were used as a means of destroying her business.', '8.  On 3 February 2003 the applicant was declared a wanted person and on 4 February 2003 a court remanded her in custody pending trial. Neither the applicant nor her representative was present.', '9.  According to the applicant, on 13 March 2003 she was arrested and taken to Chişinău police headquarters, where she was detained throughout that day, without any record of the detention being made. The Government submitted that her detention had been duly recorded. Because she had serious health problems, an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital at the doctors’ request. The applicant spent seven days in hospital under police supervision. On 20 March 2003 the applicant was released from hospital, was rearrested and placed again in the Chişinău police headquarters. She felt ill on the same day and an ambulance was called to treat her. On 11 April 2003 the applicant’s daughter complained to the Chişinău Prosecutor Office about the alleged refusal to allow the applicant’s transfer to a hospital on 20 March 2003. The applicant did not inform the Court of any reply received or of any complaint to the higher prosecutor or the court in relation to that complaint. She was transferred to prison no. 13 on 28 May 2003.', '10.  On 2 April 2003 the investigator sent a rogatory commission to the French authorities, asking them to verify whether the applicant had had contacts with the cosmetics company and whether she had been its representative in Moldova, as well as whether she had purchased cosmetic products from that company in order to import them to Moldova. On 26 July 2004 the applicant requested that “two volumes of materials from France” be added to the file. The prosecutor supported her request, on condition that the materials be translated. The court agreed, but a translation was apparently never added to the file.', '11.  The applicant requested that witnesses on her behalf be heard. In particular, on 1 November 2003 she asked for O.G., the son of one of her creditors, to be heard, since he had allegedly received large sums of money from the applicant on account of the debt she owed his mother. Moreover, she was in frequent contact with him, all of which proved, in the applicant’s opinion, that she was not hiding from her creditors but was trying in good faith to honour her obligations. The applicant submitted copies of receipts from her creditors confirming that she had repaid them various sums of money before the criminal proceedings were initiated (for instance, she repaid USD 5,000 on 13 April 2000, USD 300 on 15 January 2001, USD 500 on 15 December 2001 and USD 500 on 15 January 2002; in addition she repaid many smaller amounts to S., one of her creditors, on numerous occasions throughout 2001).', '12.  On 27 July 2005 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. The court relied on the statements of various witnesses attesting that the applicant had taken money from them and never returned it, absconding from them. It did not mention anything about the results of the rogatory commission results, but relied on “information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs”, according to which the applicant was not a representative of the French company in Moldova. In her appeal, the applicant noted, inter alia, that she had not been given a translation of the materials obtained from the French authorities. She repeated her request during the hearing of the Chişinău Court of Appeal, adding that the lower court had noted the impossibility of examining those documents in the absence of a translation. She referred to the receipts from her creditor S. as evidence of the fact that they had been in frequent contact throughout 2001 when she repaid him sums of money on account of her debt (see paragraph 11 above). She also noted that on 30 November 2001 she had travelled together with S. to the customs to meet a truck full of merchandise imported from the French company, and that this had been confirmed during the first-instance court hearing. The applicant also declared that she had asked the investigator to summon O.G. as a witness in order to confirm that she had repaid large amounts of money to him as the son of one of her creditors. She further submitted that she had been detained, together with seven others, for more than two years in a small cell measuring 10 square metres, and that the cell was insufficiently lit, ventilated or equipped with elementary necessary items. She also complained that she had been subjected to ill-treatment while in detention, following which she was admitted to hospital with a broken arm. She asked for her health problems to be taken into consideration, as well as the inhuman conditions of detention in which she had been detained for a lengthy period of time.', '13.  The Chişinău Court of Appeal scheduled a hearing for 1 December 2005. According to the transcript of that hearing, at the applicant’s lawyer’s request the court agreed to add to the file a recommendation issued by the French company and addressed to the court, according to which the applicant had been the company’s representative in Moldova from 1994-2002 and had been recognised as a serious and responsible business person, whose activity had allowed the French company to expand its business in Moldova. During the hearing of 1 December 2005 the applicant requested “to see the set of documents from France [given that] the first-instance court stated that the documents had not been translated, and therefore had not been examined”. The applicant’s lawyer supported the request, adding that accounting documents from France had been submitted to the first-instance court which confirmed the business relationship between the French cosmetics company and his client, who represented that company in Moldova. According to the transcript, the court refused the request, on the ground that the materials referred to by the applicant had been the subject of examination by the lower court.', '14.  Having examined the parties’ submissions, the court upheld the lower court’s judgment, finding that all the arguments raised by the defence had been examined by the lower court and had been properly rejected as unfounded. In respect of the applicant’s argument that she had not had the opportunity to study a translated version of the documents obtained from the French authorities, the court found that this matter had already been examined during the hearing before the first-instance court.', '15.  In his appeal on points of law, the applicant’s lawyer noted the lower courts’ refusal to hear witnesses on her behalf; the fact that the courts remained silent about the evidence that she had already repaid an important part of the debt to her creditors, which excluded an intention to evade payment; that the file was not complete, certain of the documents in the file proving her innocence not having been forwarded by the first-instance court to the Court of Appeal; and that two of the four alleged victims had not appeared at the hearing before the Chişinău Court of Appeal, even though she considered their presence mandatory.', '16.  The applicant’s lawyer considered that she was being prosecuted for her inability to repay her debts, contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention. He also referred to the information from the Customs Department, confirming that on 29 November 2003 the company in which the applicant worked as executive director had imported cosmetic products from the French company, and therefore was pursuing precisely the type of activity for which the applicant had borrowed the money. He also referred to the contract between the French company and the applicant, according to which the latter acted as the exclusive representative of that company in Moldova. He finally referred to awards received by her in 1999-2001, including “Best business person of the year 1999”.', '17.  On 28 March 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the lower courts’ judgments. The court found that the applicant had borrowed large sums of money and then avoided contact with her creditors and refused to repay her debts. She did not deny having borrowed the money, but explained that she had invested the money in the cosmetic products and was not yet able to repay it. Moreover, the applicant presented herself to her creditors as a credible person – the official representative of the French company in Moldova - while in fact she was not such a representative. She thus misrepresented to the victims the nature of the relationship into which they had entered. Even though she had always confirmed in writing her debts owed to the victims, the applicant would avoid meeting them and had no intention of paying.', '18.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice was final. An extraordinary appeal by the applicant to the Supreme Court of Justice was dismissed on 18 December 2006.', '19.  On 26 March 2009 the applicant was released from prison.', '20.  The applicant stated that she had returned some of the money she had borrowed, but was unable to return the remainder because her economic activity had been interrupted by her arrest.\\nII. RELEVANT REPORTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE FOR THE PREVENTION OF TORTURE AND INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT', '21.  The relevant parts of the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) on its visit to Moldova between 20 and 30 September 2004 (CPT/Inf (2006) 7) read as follows (unofficial translation): 55.  The situation in the majority of prisons visited, faced with the economic situation in the country, remained difficult and one recounted a number of problems already identified during the visits in 1998 and 2001 in terms of material conditions and detention regimes.\\nAdded to this is the problem of overcrowding, which remains serious. In fact, even if the prisons were not at full capacity – as is the case with prison no. 3, in which the number of detainees was significantly reduced in comparison with that during the last visit of the Committee – they continued to be extremely overcrowded. In fact, the accommodation capacity was still based on an inadequate 2m2 per detainee, which in practice was often even less. 77.  The follow-up visit to Prison no. 3 in Chişinău did not have a satisfactory result. The progress found was in fact minimal and limited to some current repairs. The repair of the ventilation system had been possible primarily through the financial support of civil society (especially NGOs), and the space for daily exercise had been created by the efforts of detainees and their families.\\nThe repair, renovation and maintenance of cells is entirely the responsibility of the detainees themselves and their families, who also pay for the necessary materials. They must also provide their own bed sheets and blankets, the institution being able to give them only used mattresses. 79.  ... In sum, the conditions of life in the great majority of cells in Blocks I-II and in the transit cells continue to be miserable. ...\\nFinally, despite the drastic reduction in overcrowding, a very high, even intolerable, level of occupancy of the cells can be observed. 83.  Other than in the Lipcani Re-education Colony for Minors, where the efforts made in this respect are to be highlighted, the quantity and quality of detainees’ food everywhere is a source of grave concern. The delegation was inundated with complaints regarding the absence of meat and dairy products. The findings of the delegation regarding both the stocks of food and the menus confirm the credibility of these complaints. Its findings also confirmed that in certain places (in Prison no. 3 and elsewhere), the food served was repulsive and virtually inedible (for instance, insects and vermin were present). This is not surprising, given the general state of the kitchens and the quality of their equipment.\\nThe Moldovan authorities have always claimed financial difficulties in ensuring the adequate feeding of detainees. However, the Committee insists that this is a fundamental requirement of life which must be ensured by the State to those in its charge, and that nothing can exonerate it from this responsibility. ...”', '22.  The relevant parts of the report of the CPT on its visit to Moldova between 21 and 25 November 2005 (CPT/Inf (2008) 35) read as follows (unofficial translation): 9.  ... As for financial resources, the basic subsistence needs in the prisons are only partly covered by the State budget: at the level of 33% in respect of food (meat, milk and eggs being obtained from humanitarian projects). ...”', '23.  The relevant parts of the report of the CPT on its visit to Moldova between 14 and 24 September 2007 (CPT/Inf (2008) 39) read as follows (unofficial translation): 47.  The CPT can only welcome the above-mentioned measures taken by the Moldovan authorities. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee’s delegation during the 2007 visit shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding continues to be a problem; despite the fact that all establishments visited were operating well below their official capacity, and there was on average only two square metres of living space per prisoner, rather than the standard of four square metres provided for in Moldovan legislation.\\nThe CPT is convinced that the only viable way to control overcrowding and achieve the standard of at least four square metres of living space per prisoner is to adopt policies designed to limit or moderate the number of people sent to prison. In this connection, the Committee must stress the need for a strategy covering both admission to and release from prison to ensure that imprisonment really is the ultimate remedy. This implies, in the first place, an emphasis on non-custodial measures in the period before the imposition of a sentence and, in the second place, the adoption of measures which facilitate the reintegration into society of individuals who have been deprived of their liberty.\\nThe CPT trusts that the Moldovan authorities will continue their efforts to combat prison overcrowding, and that in so doing they will be guided by Recommendation Rec(99)22 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe concerning prison overcrowding and prison population increases, as well as Recommendation Rec(2003)22 on conditional release (parole).”'], 'applicants': ['PLOTNICOVA'], 'defendants': ['MOLDOVA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['12', '21', '22', '23', '32', '9'], '6': ['11', '12', '13']}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [4, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18], 'explained_indices': [0, 4, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 17, 18, 2, 3, 1], 'explained_distances': [0.12900576, -0.024654895, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.029947251, -0.1988053, -0.315715, -0.40798083], 'number_of_sentences': 19, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

He is currently serving his prison sentence in Pechora prison (Komi Republic).', '6.  On 20 December 2001 a judge at the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan (Верховный суд Републики Башкорстан) ordered the interception of the applicant’s telephone calls.', '7.  On 19 January 2002 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on suspicion of several counts of theft and aggravated murder. The prosecution’s case was that the applicant, the chief security officer of the joint stock company “Bashneft” (АНК «Башнефть»), together with other security officers, had repeatedly stolen petroleum products from Tuymazy gas-processing plant (Туймазинский газоперерабатывающий завод) belonging to ”Bashneft”. The applicant was also accused of having killed O., a presumed accomplice, in order to cover up the criminal activity.', '8.  On 23 November 2002 a senior investigator of the Bashkortostan Prosecution Office (Прокуратура Републики Башкорстан) dismissed the applicant’s complaints concerning different investigation steps. The applicant argued, inter alia, that:\\n“As it appears from a comparison of the audio records with the printed records of telephone conversations, the records concerning the telephone conversations of [the applicant] show traces of forgery, the audio cassettes contain much less conversations than the printed records. Consequently, it is impossible to establish the time of each conversation. The annotation of the conversations shows that they were forged.\\n...\\nOne of the groups which was looking for [O.] ... on 14 January 2002, was headed by ... the brother of co-defendant [Nu.]. It follows that there are reasonable doubts as to the truthfulness of the testimony given by this witness.”', '9.  The prosecutor stated in his decision in particular that:\\n“There is no need to examine the audio records on the audio cassettes Nos. 613, 933 and 137, as there are no reasons to consider that the said audio records are forged or that any other modifications were made. Apart from this, many of the audio records ... do not concern the subject of the investigation .... The most important audio records were submitted to [forensic experts] who confirmed that the records did not show any signs of forgery or any other modifications made in the course of the recording or afterwards.”', '10.  In the proceedings, the applicant and certain co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The remaining co-defendants pleaded guilty in part. Some of them, including co-defendant Nu. in respect of the theft on the night of 6 December 2001, also confessed to having falsely accused the applicant during the pre-trial investigation under pressure from the police officers. The records of telephone conversations between persons involved in the petroleum thefts were also admitted in evidence. In this respect, the applicant submitted at trial that the audio cassettes with the records of these conversations showed traces of forgery and that the evidence of the forensic expert had been carried out contrary to the law. He stated that he had never had any conversation with anybody in respect of the stealing of petroleum products from Tuymazy gas-processing plant.', '11.  On 16 June 2003 a judge at the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment.', '12.  With respect to the theft of petroleum products on the night of 6 December 2001, the court heard O.’s mother and V. with whom O. lived in partnership. It also relied on statements by witness N. given during the pre-trial investigation, in which he confirmed that a man named Vladimir (the applicant’s first name) had approached him offering to find buyers for petroleum products and that they had made a deal on 5 and 6 December 2001. He also stated that on 6 December 2001 at about 4 or 5 a.m., he had given RUB 50,000 to Vladimir. According to him, he did not know that Vladimir had been selling the petroleum products illegally. These facts were corroborated by corresponding telephone records between N. and the subscriber of a mobile phone which was used by the applicant. In this respect, the court noted:\\n“According to the records of the telephone conversations between [N.] on mobile phone ‘8-901-475-5808’ and the subscriber of mobile phone number’“8-293-38-266’ (this telephone was used by [the applicant]) [N.] began talking with the subscriber on 19 November 2001, talked with the same subscriber a few times on 4 December 2001, and from 3.45 pm on 5 December 2001 until 5.10 am on 6 December 2001 talked with him on 24 occasions.”', '13.  The court further took into account the pre-trial submissions of witnesses S., Kha., Na. and G., none of whom appeared at the trial. The witnesses described, inter alia, the events of 5 and 6 December 2001 but did not say anything about the applicant’s direct participation in the theft. The court decided to read out their statements, on the grounds that it had been impossible to ensure their attendance. It appears from the documents in the case file that witnesses Kha. and Na. did not attend the trial since they had been on mission, and that witness Si. (see paragraph 20 below) and G. had apologised for not attending due to family reasons.', '14.  The court further referred to material from the investigation in which witness Na. had shown the places where the cisterns had entered the premises of the petroleum company.', '15.  The judgment also referred to the pre-trial statements of co-defendants Mi., Mu. and Gu., which were inconsistent with their evidence at trial, one of them indicating the applicant as a person who had been on the premises of the petroleum company on the relevant night. The court finally relied on certain material evidence relating to the time in question.', '16.  As regards the theft of petroleum products on the nights from 29 to 30 December 2001 and from 11 to 12 January 2002, the applicant, together with certain co-defendants, pleaded not guilty at trial. Due to the inconsistencies between the co-defendants’ pleadings at trial and their pre-trial statements, the court relied on their original declarations from which it appeared that the applicant had assured the free passage of fuel trucks onto the premises of the territory of the petroleum company. The court stated in this respect that their original statements were consistent with other evidence contained in the case file and given at trial.', '17.  In respect of both thefts, the court further relied on the pre-trial submissions of witnesses Si., Gi., A., T. and Sh., who had failed to appear at the trial. They did not mention that the applicant had been involved in the theft, merely describing the events of that night. The applicant allegedly objected to the reading out of the statements which they had made at the pre-trial stage, on the grounds that he wished to examine these witnesses in person. According to him, his objections were rejected.\\nMoreover, the court heard witness Khu. whose pre-trial testimony had also been read out because of certain contradictions with his statement at trial. According to the court, his pre-trial statements were consistent with the pre-trial statements of witnesses Si., Gi., A. and T.', '18.  In respect of the theft on the night from 11 to 12 January 2002, the applicant and three co-detainees pleaded not guilty and three co-defendants pleaded partly guilty. It appears from the judgment that at trial co-defendant Nu. stated that he had been forced to incriminate the applicant and co-defendants B. and Sh., having been put under pressure by the police officers at the pre-trial stage.', '19.  The court further relied on the recorded telephone conversations stating, in particular, that:\\n“... the guilt of the defendants in respect of the theft of petroleum products on the nights from 29 to 30 December 2001 and from 11 to 12 January 2002 is confirmed by the records of the inspection on the site and the examination of the audio cassettes containing the telephone conversations from the mobile number used by [the applicant]. For example, on the nights of 29 December 2001, 30 December 2001, 11 and 12 January 2002 at night there were phone calls from the number used by [the applicant] to the mobile phones of [O.], [co-defendant Sh.]; [the audio cassettes also contained] the phone calls to the work phone of [co-defendants Nu.]. The conversations concerned the journey of petrol tankers which arrived in order to collect petroleum products, the fact that the petroleum tanker had been detained on 12 January 2002 ...\\nAt trial these audio cassettes ... were examined and ... [O.’s mother] and [co-defendant Nu.] recognised the voices of [O.], [of the applicant and defendants Sh. and his own voice].”\\nThe court also heard three employees of the petroleum company who described the relevant circumstances of the theft in question.', '20.  According to the Government, the statements of absent witnesses S., Na., G., Si., Gi., A. and T. and Sh. did not incriminate the applicant, as they only described the circumstances of the theft and did not provide any information suggesting that the applicant had participated in the offence.\\nThe Government also state that the Russian authorities took all possible measures to ensure the witnesses’ attendance. They note that by a court order of 24 January 2003, the absent witnesses were summoned to appear at trial. That order was to be enforced by the Bashkortostan and Tatarstan authorities respectively, neither of which succeeded in bringing the witnesses before the court. The case file includes telegrams and official reports containing information as to why witnesses G., Si., Na. and Kha. were absent (see also paragraph 13 above).', '21.  With respect to the murder of O., the court relied on statements of the victim’s parents and partner during the trial, recordings of his telephone conversations with the applicant, and the results of several expert examinations. The court noted, inter alia, that:\\n“In accordance with the records of the telephone conversations of [O.], he regularly contacted [the applicant] who used the mobile phone number ‘8-902-38-266’, registered in the name of his wife ...\\n...\\n[O.] made the last call from his mobile phone to the home number of his mother (6-21-63) on 14 January 2002 at 6.48.52 pm., which is consistent with the testimony of [his mother] given at trial in which she stated that this was precisely the time at which her son had called home and said that [the applicant] was killing him ...”\\nThe court examined the reasons submitted by [the applicant] and his representatives for claiming that the surveillance of the telephone conversations had been carried out contrary to the criminal procedure laws and the Constitution ... on the grounds that the permission for the surveillance granted by the Supreme Court had been given in respect of the mobile phone of [the applicant], while the police officers had in fact carried out surveillance of the mobile phone of his wife ...\\n...\\nAs it appears from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan of 20 December 2001 ... the permission related to the surveillance of the telephone conversations at the applicant’s home and ... place of work, as well as the surveillance of the mobile phone of [the applicant]. The court clearly established that [the applicant] had used the mobile phone “8-293 (or 902)-38-266” which was registered in the name of his wife ...”', '22.  In his grounds of appeal the applicant complained, inter alia, that the trial court had not secured the attendance of the key witnesses N. and other witnesses. He also stated that the records of the telephone conversations were not officially certified and, therefore, could be forged.', '23.  On 24 September 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment finding that the court of first instance had correctly assessed the facts established during the court proceedings and had reached the right legal conclusions. It stated, inter alia, that the fact that on the night to 12 January 2002 an organised group involving the employees of the plant and paramilitary protection unit, together with a member of the road police (State Inspectorate for Road Safety - государственная инспекция по безопасности дорожного движения (ГИБДД)) committed the theft of the petroleum products to the value of RUB 34,483.56 was established on the basis of the statements of three co-defendants given at the trial.', '24.  It further stated that the applicant’s guilt in this case, as well as his guilt of the thefts on the nights to 6 and 30 December 2001 respectively, was confirmed by the testimony of four co-defendants, by the statement of witness N. as to the handover of RUB 50,000 to the applicant, by the content of the transcription of the applicant’s telephone conversations with the above co-defendants according to which the applicant had several times spoken about the different matters relating to the theft, by the record of the inspection of the scene and of cistern KAMAZ and its trailer, by the investigation experiments and by other evidence which had been described in detail in the first instance judgment.', '25.  The Supreme Court added that, according to the records of the confrontations between the applicant and other persons, including two of co-defendants M. and Nu., who had denounced his involvement in the thefts, the applicant had not denied their assertions but had left them “without comments”.', '26.  In respect of the applicant’s allegation that the audio records were forged, the court noted that the expert forensic report showed no traces of forgery or any other modifications.', '27.  The applicant was held in Ufa IZ-3/1 pre-trial detention facility (ФБУ ИЗ-1/3 ГУФСИН г. Уфы) from 10 May to 20 December 2002 and from 7 February to 21 December 2003. According to the Government, on 21 December 2003 the applicant was transported to Mikunsky ULIU prison in the Komi Republic (Микуньское УЛИУ ГРОВД Республики Коми) to serve the rest of his sentence. Moreover, from 20 December 2002 to 7 February 2003 he was detained in the temporary detention unit at Tuymazinsky police station (ИВС ГРОВД гор. Туймазы) to be at the disposal of the Tuymazinsky City Court (Туймазинский городской суд).', '28.  In his letter of 22 December 2005, the applicant stated that in Ufa IZ-3/1 pre-trial detention facility, he had mostly been detained, together with three other co-detainees, in buildings nos. 2 and 3 in cells measuring 3x4 metres equipped with two bunk beds. In his cell in building no. 2, there was a pan for use as a lavatory and a washstand just above it, the toilet was not separated from the living area, and the stench from it was unbearable. The inmates had to use a sheet as a partition to afford themselves a small degree of privacy, but even that was later forbidden by the prison authorities. There was no table in the cell. Daily walks lasted generally 30 minutes and exceptionally one hour.'], 'applicants': ['SULDIN'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3', '6'], 'violated_articles': ['6', '3'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['27', '28', '33', '35'], '6': ['12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20'], '41': ['30']}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 22, 23], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 22, 23], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 2, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 11, 22, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 12, 23, 3, 4], 'explained_distances': [0.12368009, 0.11525804, 0.036349125, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.14980112, -0.31645137, -0.3746562], 'number_of_sentences': 24, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine.', '6.  At 6 p.m. on 14 April 1998 the applicant and K. were apprehended by police officers Kh., Ko. and L. at a trolleybus stop and taken to the police station. Kh. later testified that the applicant and K. had been apprehended because they had been fighting with other young men, who had run off.', '7.  In the police station Kh. told the applicant to sit down. He then attached the applicant by handcuffs to a metal ring in the wall and sprayed him in the face with tear gas. Kh. then kicked the applicant in the chest and hit him several times on the head, neck and back. Kh. later produced written accounts, allegedly given by private individuals B. and Kl., stating that the applicant had behaved violently and that that was the reason for his apprehension. On the following morning the applicant was released.', '8.  The applicant was in hospital between 16 April and 19 May 1998. He was diagnosed with concussion, body and chest injuries and a fractured bone in his neck.', '9.  On 9 January 2002 the applicant was recorded as falling into the third category of disability (the mildest) on account of the injuries he had received.', '10.  In April 1998 the applicant requested the institution of criminal proceedings against Kh.', '11.  Between April and December 1998 various persons were questioned by the prosecutor’s office. In the meantime, on 5 June 1998 the police officially informed the applicant that he had been arrested for being drunk and molesting passers-by. On an unidentified date he was also informed that the police officers’ actions had been lawful. In August 1998 the police issued a certificate stating that no force had been used on the applicant («меры физического воздействия не применялись»).', '12.  On 29 October 1998 a forensic medical examination concluded that the applicant had sustained traumatic oedema on his neck, chest and hands, bruises on one hand and his chest, a closed craniocerebral injury, concussion and some broken bones in the neck. The injuries were classified as grievous bodily harm endangering life at the moment of infliction. They could have been inflicted in the circumstances described by the applicant.', '13.  On 8 December 1998 the Dzerzhynskyy District Prosecutor’s Office instituted criminal proceedings in respect of the infliction of grievous bodily harm on the applicant (по факту заподіяння тяжких тілесних ушкоджень).', '14.  On 14 December 1998 the applicant was given the status of victim.', '15.  A forensic medical examination carried out in January 1999 reached similar conclusions to the one of 29 October 1998.', '16.  On 30 March 1999 criminal proceedings were instituted against Kh. and joined to the criminal case instituted on 8 December 1998. Kh. was charged with infliction of grievous bodily harm, abuse of power with grave consequences, and forgery. According to the Government, on the same date the applicant lodged within criminal proceedings a civil claim against Kh.', '17.  On the same date it was decided not to institute criminal proceedings against Ko. and L. It was also decided that there was no evidence that the applicant and K. had resisted the police in any way.', '18.  In April 1999 the criminal case against Kh. was transferred to the Dzerzhynskyy District Court of Kharkiv.', '19.  Between May 1999 and September 2000 seven court hearings were scheduled but all of them were postponed for various reasons (hearing scheduled on a public holiday, judge being busy on another case, “for technical reasons”, Kh. failing to appear twice, victim and witnesses failing to appear).', '20.  Between September 2000 and August 2001 eleven court hearings took place and two were postponed because the judge was ill.', '21.  On 23 August 2001 the court sentenced Kh. to five years’ conditional imprisonment, with three years’ probation, for infliction of grievous bodily harm, abuse of power, and forgery. Kh. was also prohibited from occupying “particular positions” in the police for five years and had to pay a fine of 300 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH). The applicant was awarded UAH 12,261.43 (at the material time around 2,526 euros (EUR)) in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.', '22.  On the same date the court adopted a separate ruling by which it informed the Dzerzhynskyy District Prosecutor that the Kharkiv Regional Department of the Ministry of the Interior had not properly examined the applicant’s complaints and that witnesses Kho., Ko. and Ch. (police officers) had made false statements in court. In particular, these witnesses had testified that the applicant had himself hit the wall with his head and that the gas and handcuffs had been used in order to restrain him. The court found these statements to be untrue as they contradicted other evidence in the case.', '23.  On 3 December 2001 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 23 August 2001, finding that the sentence was too lenient, and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the first-instance court.', '24.  On 25 December 2001 the case was received by the Dzerzhynskyy District Court and a court hearing was scheduled for 16 April 2002.', '25.  On 16 April 2002 the hearing did not take place since “a lawyer had failed to appear”.', '26.  Between April 2002 and October 2003 six more hearings were postponed, the judge being busy in another case, on vacation or ill. On one occasion the hearing was postponed because Kh.’s lawyer had failed to appear.', '27.  On 15 October 2003 the conclusion of the previous forensic medical examination was confirmed.', '28.  Between October 2003 and May 2005 seven court hearings took place, four hearings were postponed as witnesses had failed to appear or the judge was ill or on vacation, and four hearings were postponed at the applicant’s request or because of the applicant’s failure to appear.', '29.  On 10 May 2005 the Dzerzhynskiy District Court found Kh. guilty of abuse of power and forgery, and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment, but dispensed him from serving the sentence.', '30.  On 18 October 2005 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed that decision and remitted the case to the Kyivskiy District Court of Kharkiv for fresh consideration. The court also adopted three separate rulings. It informed the Kharkiv Regional Council of Judges that the judges at the Dzerzhynskiy District Court had delayed the consideration of the case and failed to take into account that Kh. had also been accused of the infliction of grievous bodily harm. In particular, the court stated that since 14 April 1999 six judges had been replaced and for a total of four years no action had been taken in the case. The court also noted that the prosecutor had failed to respond to the court’s separate ruling of 23 August 2001.', '31.  On 3 July 2006 the Kyivskyy District Court sentenced Kh. to five years’ conditional imprisonment, with three years’ probation, for infliction of grievous bodily harm endangering life at the moment of infliction, and abuse of power. Kh. was also prohibited for three years from occupying positions which involved exercising State power. The charges concerning forgery were dismissed as time-barred. The court noted that Kh. had partially compensated the damage inflicted by him and had committed no further crimes. As additional mitigating circumstances, the court noted that Kh. was a carer for his partner’s minor son and had an aged mother. The applicant’s claim for damages was left unexamined since “the applicant would amend it”. The applicant did not appeal against the decision.', '32.  In March 2007 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the Kharkiv Main Regional Department of the Ministry of the Interior and the State Treasury of Ukraine, claiming UAH 121,599 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and UAH 1,052.87 in respect of pecuniary damage.', '33.  On 2 April 2008 the Kyivskyy District Court found against the applicant.', '34.  On 24 June 2008 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed that decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration.', '35.  On 25 March 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed the decision of 24 June 2008 and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the Court of Appeal.', '36.  On 11 June 2009 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 2 April 2008 and awarded the applicant UAH 80,000 (at the material time approximately EUR 7,600) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and UAH 1,052.87 in respect of pecuniary damage.', '37.

On 18 September 1992 an investigation was opened in Bulgaria against the applicant, who lived in Germany at that time, on suspicion that she had issued fraudulent cheques. On 28 September 1992 the applicant was charged in absentia and her pre-trial detention was ordered. A warrant for her arrest was issued and the proceedings were suspended.', '7.  The applicant learned of the proceedings against her on an unspecified date in late 1995 during a telephone conversation with the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities. On 14 December 1995 she was arrested by the German police in connection with extradition proceedings opened against her. Later on she was released. On 13 March 1998 the German authorities decided to extradite her. On 5 October 1998 they invited her to appear before the Bulgarian authorities by 26 October 1998, which she did not do. On 12 December 1998 the applicant was extradited to Bulgaria and taken to Sliven prison.', '8.  The criminal proceedings were resumed on 29 January 1999. On 17 May 1999 the applicant was charged again and questioned.', '9.  On 9 July 1999 the Sofia district prosecutor terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant, finding that the charges had not been proved.', '10.  It appears that thereafter the applicant returned to Germany.', '11.  On 11 October 2001 the Sofia city prosecutor quashed the decree of 9 July 1999 and remitted the case for further investigation.', '12.  On 2 July 2002 the applicant travelled to Bulgaria and was arrested at Varna airport. The next day she was informed that the proceedings had been resumed and was questioned. She was released on bail on 11 July 2002.', '13.  In the period from 3 December 2002 to 4 June 2004 the investigator proposed on two occasions that the criminal proceedings be discontinued but the Sofia city prosecutor ordered a further investigation and on the latter date sent the case to Sliven regional public prosecutor’s office. In a decree of 2 July 2004 the latter discontinued the criminal proceedings and referred the file to the Sofia district public prosecutor’s office. A jurisdiction dispute arose, which was settled on 9 November 2004 when Burgas appeals public prosecutor’s office quashed the decree of 2 July 2004 and held that the Sofia city public prosecutor’s office had authority to deal with the case.', '14.  Meanwhile, on 14 October 2004 the applicant made a request under Article 239a of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the case against her be examined by a court. On 3 December 2004 the prosecuting authorities sent the file to the Sofia District Court. It appears that a jurisdiction dispute arose between the District Court and the Sofia City Court, which was settled on 7 February 2005.', '15.  On 18 February 2005 the District Court invited the Sofia city prosecutor to indict the applicant within two months. It appears that this was done on an unspecified date in 2005.', '16.

On 13 May 2003 the applicant again requested to be allowed to travel to Germany, stating that her husband was ill. She submitted medical certificates. On 15 May 2003 the Sofia city prosecutor dismissed the request. He stated that the family reasons put forward by the applicant did not justify the temporary lifting of the travel ban. He further noted that the case was factually and legally complex and required further investigation. The prosecutor also considered that the risk of the applicant absconding could not be ruled out, noting the 1995-98 extradition proceedings.', '20.  A subsequent request by the applicant was dismissed on 14 August 2003. The refusal was upheld by the City Court on 29 August 2003.', '21.

She argued that she had never obstructed the investigation. On 12 December 2003 the Sofia city prosecutor again dismissed her request. Following an appeal, on 31 December 2003 the City Court upheld the refusal, reasoning that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to Bulgaria, which would additionally delay the criminal proceedings.

The applicant was born in 1963 and is currently in detention in Wronki.', '6.   The applicant has been serving a prison sentence in Wronki Prison since 31 March 2010.', '7.  On 19 September 2010 he brought a civil compensation claim before the Szamotuły District Court. He claimed that the conditions of detention in many of his cells in Wronki Prison were so bad as to amount to a breach of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. He referred to the fact that the cells were not properly heated in the autumn and winter and had no proper ventilation in the summer, meaning that the prisoners suffered from intense levels of heat. The windows were old and the frames leaked. He further submitted that the toilet facilities were only separated from the cells by a low fibreboard partition, which made even a minimum level of privacy impossible for him.', '8.  On 21 June 2011 the Szamotuły District Court refused a request by the applicant to gather evidence by producing photographs and carrying out an on-the-spot inspection of the cells concerned. It closed the hearing and gave judgment, dismissing the applicant’s claim in its entirety.\\nThe court established, referring to evidence submitted by the State Treasury, acting as the legal representative for Wronki Prison, that prisoners had access to sports, cultural and educational activities and medical care. They were provided with personal hygiene items and had appropriate food. Those factors, seen as a whole, alleviated the harm which was an inherent part and consequence of serving prison sentences.\\nThe court further found that the toilet facilities in the applicant’s cells were indeed separated off by fibreboard partitions. This did not provide full privacy, but was sufficient to ensure that the prisoners were out of sight of others when they used the toilet. There was a WC and a washbasin in each toilet facility.\\nAs regards the applicant’s allegations of inadequate ventilation and insufficient heating in the cells, the court found that the cells were well lit and properly ventilated; the windows had been repaired and the heaters had been changed and worked properly. As regards the alleged lack of light, the court found that the applicant had been granted special permission to use an additional reading lamp.\\nThe court was of the view that the State Treasury had not acted unlawfully and that there had been no intention to act in bad faith or to cause harm or damage to the applicant. In the absence of unlawfulness no breach of personal rights could be found. In any event, the conditions in Wronki Prison were not so harsh as to amount to a breach of personal rights.', '9.  The applicant appealed, arguing that the court had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly, in the main because it had refused to gather evidence in the form of photographs, film or an inspection of the cells. The judgment had therefore been based on insufficient factual findings. Furthermore, in so far as the court had referred to the general conditions in which the applicant served his sentence (quality of the food, medical care, access to cultural and sports activities), those factors had not constituted the basis of his claim. He had complained neither about poor food quality nor about insufficient access to cultural and sports activities. The grounds of his claim had fundamentally related to the sanitary conditions in the cells and, in particular, a lack of privacy when using the toilet. This lack of privacy had been explicitly confirmed by the first-instance court. He reiterated that the lack of a proper divide between the toilets and the cell amounted to a breach of his personal rights and dignity. He further indicated that some of the cells at the prison had toilet facilities that were properly separated from the rest of the cell by normal walls and a door.', '10.  By a judgment of 6 December 2011 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, fully accepting the findings of fact made by the first‑instance court and that court’s legal assessment of those facts. In particular, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the nuisance caused by the manner in which cells were fitted with toilet facilities, namely by way of fibreboard partitions, did not exceed the normal difficulties and harm which were inherent in serving a prison sentence.'], 'applicants': ['SZAFRAŃSKI'], 'defendants': ['POLAND'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['3', '8'], 'violated_articles': ['8'], 'court_assessment_references': {'3': ['16', '17', '8'], '8': ['24', '31']}, 'silver_rationales': [3], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [3], 'explained_indices': [0, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2], 'explained_distances': [0.023287654, 0.018912911, 0.008246362, 0.008246362, 0.0016800165, -0.016567469], 'number_of_sentences': 6, 'article_id': 9, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Tallinn.', '7.  On 4 October 2006 a criminal investigation was started in respect of the applicant’s violent behaviour towards her partner. Allegedly, on 17 September 2006, she had repeatedly punched him and broken his nose.', '8.  On 5 November 2006 another criminal investigation was started in respect of the applicant’s allegedly violent behaviour towards her partner on 3 November 2006. The two proceedings were subsequently joined.', '9.  According to the applicant, her partner had physically attacked her and she had acted in self-defence.', '10.  On 6 November 2006 the applicant was admitted to the admissions ward of the Psychiatric Clinic of the North Estonia Medical Centre.', '11.  On 8 November 2006 the psychiatric clinic filed an application with the Harju County Court for the authorisation of the applicant’s involuntary psychiatric treatment. The application was accompanied by an opinion signed by two doctors, according to which the applicant had been suffering from a mental illness for some years. She had been treated in different hospitals and had been making outpatient visits to psychiatrists. When not in hospital, she had used medicines irregularly. According to the doctors’ opinion, the applicant was suffering from delusions of grandeur, she was paranoid and her condition had become acute. She had attacked her partner and had been travelling with her six-year old child all over Estonia, including doing so late in the evening, and had repeatedly taken the child to a shelter. She had been hospitalised on 30 October 2006 but as she had refused inpatient treatment, had behaved in a restrained manner and had undertaken to follow outpatient treatment, she had been allowed to leave the hospital on the following day. However, the applicant had failed to undergo adequate treatment. She had become aggressive and, after having attacked her partner again, she had been hospitalised by ambulance. The doctors affirmed that at the time of her involuntary admission to the clinic on 6 November 2006 the applicant had demonstrated uninhibited and threatening behaviour. Thereafter, she had remained psychotic, had demonstrated signs of delusions of grandeur and had been paranoid. The doctors affirmed in their opinion that the applicant had refused inpatient treatment.', '12.  On 8 November 2006 the County Court decided to apply interim measures (esialgne õiguskaitse) and authorised the applicant’s involuntary psychiatric treatment for as long as necessary, but for no longer than three months. The relevant part of the court’s decision read as follows:\\n“The court, having examined the evidence presented to it, finds that there are circumstances [warranting] involuntary emergency psychiatric treatment pursuant to the procedure for the application of interim measures. According to the application of the health care institution and the accompanying letter from the attending physicians, [the applicant] was taken to the Psychiatric Clinic by ambulance on 6 November 2006 because she had attacked her partner. She had also been roaming around Estonia with her six-year old child, thereby exhausting [the child] and damaging the child’s health. On admission the patient was noisy, agitated and very angry with her partner: she did not deny having punched him, but argued that she had done so in self-defence. As [the applicant’s] behaviour was threatening and uncontrollable, involuntary emergency psychiatric treatment was applied in respect of her from 6 November 2006, as she posed a danger to herself and to those around her. Previously, [the applicant] had received inpatient treatment [at a psychiatric hospital] in Jämejala and [had also been treated] in recent years in Tallinn. She had also been making outpatient visits to psychiatrists. Since 1993 [the applicant] had received treatment at the Psychiatric Clinic [of the North Estonia Medical Centre] on five occasions.\\nAt the time of the lodging of the application the patient’s condition had not improved. [She] is agitated and stressed, and does not understand the need for treatment.\\nConsidering [the applicant’s] mental state and the fact that her treatment is not possible by other means, the court finds that there are grounds to apply interim measures pursuant to Article 534 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure – that is, before hearing the person herself and the other persons [involved], and before appointing a representative for her. Based on the above, involuntary emergency psychiatric treatment shall be authorised in respect of [the applicant] for as long as necessary, but for no longer than three months.”\\nOn the same date, the decision was sent to the psychiatric clinic by fax.', '13.  On 8 November 2006, after having taken the above decision, the County Court appointed a lawyer to defend the applicant at the State’s expense.', '14.  According to the applicant, she gave her consent to undergo treatment and signed a consent form on 8 November 2006.', '15.  According to the psychiatric clinic, as stated in the reply to the applicant’s subsequent appeal against the County Court’s decision (see paragraph 20 below), the applicant had said that she consented to the treatment on 9 November 2006, after having been informed of the County Court’s decision. She had signed a consent form to that effect which had been placed in her medical file.', '16.  On 14 November 2006, in the course of the criminal proceedings, the police ordered the applicant’s forensic psychiatric examination. According to an expert report drawn up on 17 November 2006, the applicant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and, at the time of committing the acts she was accused of (that is, the alleged assaults on 17 September and 3 November 2006), she had been mentally incompetent. Furthermore, she was unable to participate in the pre-trial investigation, give evidence in court or serve a punishment.', '17.  On 21 November 2006 the County Court heard the applicant’s brother.', '18.  On 23 November 2006 the applicant’s lawyer and a judge from the County Court paid a visit to the applicant in the clinic. According to a note made by the judge in the case file concerning the hearing of the applicant, she was satisfied with her treatment, particularly satisfied with her doctor, and had no complaints.', '19.  On 13 December 2006, following a telephone call from the Estonian Patients’ Advocacy Association (“the EPAA”), the applicant was given a copy of the County Court’s decision of 8 November 2006. On 22 December 2006, represented by an EPAA lawyer, she appealed against the decision, arguing that the court had not reliably established the existence of the circumstances required for involuntary emergency psychiatric care under section 11 of the Mental Health Act (Psühhiaatrilise abi seadus). She also complained that there had been procedural violations, arguing that she had not been heard at the earliest opportunity, that both the hearing and the appointment of a lawyer had been of a merely formal nature and that the principle of equality of arms had not been complied with.', '20.  On 25 January 2007 the psychiatric clinic submitted a reply to the applicant’s appeal, explaining with reference to her medical record that the conditions for placing her in involuntary psychiatric treatment had been met. It was noted, inter alia, that the applicant’s consent to her voluntary treatment, given on 9 November 2006, had been disregarded as this had not been her true will.', '21.  On 5 February 2007 the applicant’s treatment in the psychiatric clinic was terminated and she was transferred to the Jämejala psychiatric hospital where she stayed until 5 September 2007. The legal basis for her treatment in Jämejala was the Harju County Court’s decision of 5 February 2007, made in the context of the criminal proceedings. The court found that the applicant had committed the unlawful acts she had been charged with. However, she had been mentally incompetent at the time. Therefore, the criminal proceedings were terminated and the applicant was subjected to coercive psychiatric treatment under Article 86 of the Penal Code (Karistusseadustik).', '22.  On 20 March 2007, in a written procedure, the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the applicant against the County Court’s decision of 8 November 2006.', '23.  The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court, reiterating her earlier complaints. In addition, relying on Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, she complained that she had received the County Court’s decision thirty-eight days after it had been adopted and that it had taken three months for the Court of Appeal to decide on her appeal.', '24.  On 10 October 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the elements required under section 11 of the Mental Health Act to involuntarily admit the applicant to a closed institution had been established by the lower courts which in their decisions had referred to doctors’ opinions. As regards the fifteen-day delay that had elapsed before the County Court had heard the applicant, the Supreme Court stated as follows:\\n“18.  In response to the claim in the [present] appeal concerning a violation of the second sentence of Article 534 § 3 of the [Code of Civil Procedure – “the CCP”], the [Supreme Court] notes the following. In the event of the admission of a person to a closed institution pursuant to the procedure for the application of interim measures, the person himself or herself, and those close to him or her, have to be heard (Article 534 § 1 (4) of the CCP). The second sentence of Article 534 § 2 of the CCP allows for an exception from this rule to be made if the hearing may cause significant damage to the health of the person or if the person is clearly not able to express his or her will. According to the first sentence of Article 534 § 3 of the CCP, due to the potential danger resulting from a delay (the meaning of the provision indicates that reference is made to danger to the person’s own life or other persons’ lives, health or safety), interim measures may be applied before hearing the person himself or herself and the other persons, and before appointing a representative for him or her. According to the second sentence of Article 534 § 3 of the CCP, such [hearing and appointment] must be performed promptly thereafter. The [Supreme Court] considers that the main purpose of Article 534 § 1 (4) and the second sentence of § 534 (3) of the CCP is the need to prevent an unfounded admission of a person to a closed institution or the opportunity to decide on the termination of the admission pursuant to Article 539 § 1 of the CCP.\\nIn the present case, the County Court heard the person concerned fifteen days after the decision to apply interim measures had been taken. The [Supreme Court] finds that in the present case the County Court has not given reasons for the fifteen-day delay. Although the second sentence of Article 534 § 3 of the CCP obliges the court to promptly perform certain acts (hear the person himself or herself and the other persons named in the law, and appoint him or her a representative), the meaning of the law is that the person concerned has to be heard in the first place. Since the person concerned, as a rule, will have been admitted to the closed institution by that time, his or her whereabouts will be known to the court. If there were any objective circumstances preventing the court from hearing the person concerned herself, or if there were any circumstances mentioned in the second sentence of Article 534 § 2 of the CCP (hearing the person concerned would cause significant damage to his or her health, or he or she is clearly not able to express his or her will), pertinent reasons should have been set out in the decision. However, the aforementioned violation of the norms of procedure is not so important that it would result in quashing the ruling. The County Court has heard the person concerned and, based on the materials in the case file and the rulings made, the courts have not had doubts as to the existence of the prerequisites for the person’s admission to the closed institution or as to their cessation.”'], 'applicants': ['S.'], 'defendants': ['ESTONIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5'], 'violated_articles': ['5'], 'court_assessment_references': {'5': ['24', '25', '26']}, 'silver_rationales': [18], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [18], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 9, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 18, 8, 7, 17, 4, 0, 6, 3, 5], 'explained_distances': [0.1406861, 0.064502776, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.050631285, 0.04500693, -0.0133648515, -0.01442045, -0.016783059, -0.13695383], 'number_of_sentences': 19, 'article_id': 6, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The first applicant was born in 1953, the second applicant was born in 1958 and the third applicant was born in 1983. They live in the village of Starye Atagi, the Groznenskiy District, in the Chechen Republic.', '6.  The first and second applicants are spouses and the parents of Mr Movsar Nasukhanov, born in 1980, Mr Movladi Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and the third applicant.', '7.  Between 14 and 18 February 2002 the Russian federal military carried out a special “sweeping” operation in the village of Starye Atagi.', \"8.  At about 9.30 a.m. on 14 February 2002 an armed clash commenced between a group of insurgents and the Russian servicemen. The insurgents hid inside a house at Argunskaya Street located in the vicinity of the applicants' family home and fired at the military. At some point Russian servicemen killed the insurgents and started checking other houses in the area.\", \"9.  At that time the applicants, Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov and the first applicant's two daughters were inside their house. At some point a group of servicemen wearing blue camouflage uniforms and masks arrived at the applicants' house in armoured personnel carriers (“APCs”) and entered it. The first applicant believed that the men belonged to the State Intelligence Department (“GRU”). The servicemen in blue uniforms checked the Nasukhanovs' identity papers, asked why they had been hiding insurgents and left.\", \"10.  Another group of armed men who had arrived in UAZ vehicles entered the applicants' house. Those men had badges with a “B” letter and an eagle pinned to sleeves of their camouflage uniforms. The first applicant inferred that they were members of the Pennant unit (подразделение «Вымпел»). They ordered the male members of the Nasukhanov family to lie down on the floor, lined up the women next to a wall, checked the identity papers and left.\", \"11.  A few moments later a group of armed and masked men in yellow camouflage uniforms arrived at the applicants' house in UAZ vehicles with illegible registration plates. The first applicant peeked out of the window and saw a motorcade of military vehicles and several APCs parked outside his house. The servicemen in the yellow uniforms checked the identity papers of the first applicant's sons and asked them if they knew any insurgents. The young men replied in the negative. The servicemen in yellow uniforms said that it was necessary to run a check on them, and took the third applicant and Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov away.\", '12.  Shortly after the arrest of their sons the first and second applicants learned that the Russian military had established a filtration point near a poultry-house and a mill in Starye Atagi. Some 500 persons were being kept at the filtration point.', '13.  On the day following the arrest the second applicant went to the poultry-house. Relatives of other detained persons had gathered near the building to wait for news of their family members.', \"14.  The servicemen started releasing the detainees. Some of them told the second applicant that her three sons were being kept inside the poultry‑house. The second applicant waited for her sons' release for the next three days.\", '15.  On 16 February 2002 the third applicant was released. He had been severely beaten by the servicemen and could not walk, so he had to be carried home. His body was bruised. Once at home, the third applicant said that for three days the servicemen had questioned and beaten him. Before the release they had made him sign a declaration stating that he had no complaints. The third applicant had not seen his brothers after the arrest but knew that they had been transferred to the mill where the headquarters of the federal military was located.', '16.  On 19 February 2002 the special “sweeping” operation ended.\\n(b)  Discovery of the dead bodies', \"17.  On 20 February 2002 the first and second applicants went to the village of Mesker-Yurt of the Shali District and examined two dead bodies, which had been burned from head to waist. The first and second applicants recognised their sons' shoes and trousers and identified the dead as Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov. On the same day the first and second applicants took the bodies home.\", '18.  On 18 February 2002 the Shali district temporary department of the interior (“the VOVD”) received a report that four men had been killed by servicemen of military unit no. 3179 in crossfire on the outskirts of Mesker‑Yurt. Upon inspection of the scene of the incident four charred corpses and two AK-74 machine guns were discovered in the basement of a destroyed house.', \"19.  The first applicant did not apply to a prosecutor's office after the discovery of Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov's dead bodies as he feared for the safety of the third applicant.\", '20.  On 18 February 2002 the Shali district department of the interior (“the ROVD”) received a report that four charred male corpses had been discovered in the basement of a house on the outskirts of Mesker-Yurt. Later two of those bodies were identified as Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov.', \"21.  On 18 February 2002 the prosecutor's office of the Shali District (“the district prosecutor's office”) instituted an investigation into the killing of Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov under Article 105 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated murder). The case was assigned the number 59054.\", \"22.  On 25 February 2003 the district prosecutor's office issued a report on the investigation, stating the following:\\n“At about 1 p.m. on 18 February 2002 the Shali district department of the interior received a report that four charred male corpses had been found in the basement of a residential house on the outskirts of the village of Mesker-Yurt.\\nLater the three bodies were identified as villagers of Starye Atagi, namely, Movsar Nasukhanov, born in 1980, Movladi Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and Ruslan Nasukhanov, born in 1963.\\nAn investigation into this matter was opened by the Shali district prosecutor's office in criminal case no. 59054 under Article 105 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code on 18 February 2002.”\", \"23.  On 5 March 2003 the head of the local administration of Starye Atagi described the circumstances of the Nasukhanov brothers' arrest and the discovery of their dead bodies to the district prosecutor's office. He stated that on 14 February 2002 the servicemen of the United Group Alignment had carried out a special operation to arrest insurgents, that the latter had opened fire and then had been killed and that Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov had been taken away by the servicemen and then killed. The head of the local administration also mentioned that Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov had not participated in illegal armed groups.\", \"24.  On 15 December 2003 the first applicant complained to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic about the ineffectiveness of the investigation in case no. 59054.\", \"25.  On 4 January 2004 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic informed the applicants that on an unspecified date the investigation had been resumed and was pending before the district prosecutor's office.\", \"26.  On 10 February 2004 the first applicant was summoned to the district prosecutor's office. An investigator told him that the servicemen had made a deposition explaining that his sons had been killed as they had been inside a house from which insurgents had fired at military vehicles. However, according to a statement by the owners of that house, the servicemen had killed the Nasukhanov brothers, brought their bodies to the village's outskirts and set the house on fire. The first applicant read that statement, but was not allowed to make a copy of it.\", \"27.  On 15 February 2004 the district prosecutor's office suspended the investigation in case no. 59054 for failure to identify those responsible.\", \"28.  On 24 July 2004 the military prosecutor's office of the United Group Alignment forwarded the first applicant's complaint to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic stating that an investigation into the killing of Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov was not pending before them.\", \"29.  On 2 November 2004 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic forwarded the first applicant's complaint to the district prosecutor's office and ordered that the investigation be carried out more vigorously.\", \"30.  On 29 April 2005 the acting head of the department for supervision on criminal investigations of the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic informed the first applicant of the following:\\n “The prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic studied the criminal case materials, quashed the decision of the investigator of the Shali district prosecutor's office on suspension [of the investigation] and resumed the investigation.\\nYou should address all further queries related to the investigation of this case to the Shali district prosecutor's office”.\", \"31.  On 15 February 2006 the SRJI requested an update on the progress of case no. 59054 from the district prosecutor's office.\", \"32.  On 3 March 2006 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic informed the first applicant that the investigation in case no. 59054 had been suspended on 15 February 2004 for failure to identify those responsible and noted that the first applicant had the right to study non-classified documents from the case file on the district prosecutor's office's premises.\", \"33.  On 16 November 2006 the district prosecutor's office received from the SRJI a request for access to the entire investigation file in case no. 59054.\", '34.  On 17 November 2006 the request was dismissed since pursuant to domestic laws a victim had no right to study a case file in its entirety prior to the completion of the investigation.', '35.  On 19 June 2009 the applicants were informed that the investigation had been resumed.', \"36.  On 18 February 2002 the district prosecutor's office instituted an investigation in case no. 59054 into the killings of the four men found dead in Mesker-Yurt under Article 105 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated murder).\", '37.  The investigators inspected the scene of incident and found inside a half-demolished house four seriously burned dead bodies showing signs of a violent death, two AK-74 machine guns with spent cartridges and a MOH‑50 mine. Next to the house they found forty-nine shells for 7.62 calibre bullets and two shells for 9 mm calibre bullets.', '38.  On 18 February 2002 the bodies were transferred to the deputy head of the Mesker-Yurt local administration, Mr M.', '39.  On 18 February 2002 the investigators questioned a serviceman from military unit no. 3179, Mr I., who stated the following. On 18 February 2002 a group of servicemen had been travelling past Mesker-Yurt when they were fired at from machine guns. Their senior officer had decided to block off the area from which the firing had come; the servicemen had fired back. Then a storm unit had moved forward and found four charred corpses in the ruins, two machine guns and a mine. Some servicemen had stayed at the scene of incident, and others had gone to Mesker-Yurt to bring in investigators.', '40.  On the same date Mr M. was questioned and stated that on 18 February 2002 he had heard sounds of an explosion and machine-gun fire. Then some servicemen had come to his office and told him that he had been called out by the military commander of the Shali District. They had arrived at the half-demolished house owned by Mr Kh. The servicemen had told Mr M. that they had discovered four charred corpses. He had not seen the bodies himself.', \"41.  On 18 February 2002 an officer of military unit no. 3179 (his name has not been disclosed) was questioned as a witness and stated the following. On 18 February 2002 his unit had been travelling from Khankala in four armoured personnel carriers and ten lorries after having participated in the special operation carried out there. In the vicinity of Mesker-Yurt their vehicles had been fired at. The officer had ordered the APCs to surround those who had opened fire. Four or five men had run towards a red-brick building. The servicemen had surrounded the building and fired back. At some point the servicemen had sent two missiles from a grenade launcher; the building had been set on fire. The officer's subordinates had taken two machine guns out of the building and left as they had been unable to inspect the scene more closely because of the mines scattered there. The servicemen's actions had been strictly necessary. Other servicemen from the officer's unit were also questioned and made identical depositions.\", \"42.  A resident of Mesker-Yurt was questioned and stated that Mr Kh.'s house had been demolished in the course of a special operation on 8 February 2002.\", \"43.  On 19 February 2002 the district prosecutor's office instructed the police to find witnesses and identify the deceased, but to no avail.\", \"44.  On 26 March 2002 the district prosecutor's office sent a letter to the Groznenskiy district prosecutor's office, which read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\\n“On 18 February 2002 four charred corpses of unidentified men were found in a demolished house ... in Mesker-Yurt. According to the statements by the servicemen of military unit no. 3179, those men had been killed by them in the course of an armed clash.\\nThe Shali district prosecutor's office instituted criminal proceedings in case no. 59054 ...\\nUpon assessment of the results of an inspection of the scene of the incident it is possible to conclude that the corpses had been transferred from another place and set on fire there [in the half-demolished house in Mesker-Yurt].”\", \"45.  On an unspecified date in 2002 (the exact date on the copy of the document at the Court's disposal is illegible) the district prosecutor's office sent a letter to the VOVD and the ROVD, which read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\\n“On 18 February 2002 four charred corpses of unidentified men were found in a demolished house ... in Mesker-Yurt. According to statements by the servicemen of military unit no. 3179, they killed the said men in the course of an armed clash.\\n... There are grounds to assume that the bodies were transferred to the said place in order to stage armed resistance to hide evidence of a murder.\\n Accordingly, I would ask your unit to take the following investigative measures:\\n... 2. To identify the killed men (they were most probably brought from Starye Atagi, where a special operation had been taking place)...”\", \"46.  On 18 April 2002 the district prosecutor's office suspended the investigation.\", \"47.  On 17 May 2002 the Groznenskiy district civil registrar's office issued death certificates in respect of Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov, stating that they both died on 14 February 2002. Gunshot wounds to their bodies and heads were specified as the cause of the death in both cases.\", '48.  In March 2003 ballistic expert examinations of the bullets and shells found at the scene of incident were carried out. They did not match those in the ballistic database of the Chechen Republic.', \"49.  On an unspecified date in August 2003 (the exact date on the copy of the first page of the document at the Court's disposal is illegible) the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic quashed the decision on suspension of the proceedings for the reason that “the investigation [had] not actually been carried out, the decision on suspension [had] been taken by an investigator prematurely and unlawfully”. It was noted that the bodies had not been formally identified and that the relatives of the Nasukhanov brothers who had stated that the dead bodies belonged to their family members had not been questioned. Moreover, a post-mortem examination of the bodies had not been ordered and carried out.\", '50.  It appears that at some point the proceedings were resumed.', \"51.

On 22 January 2004 Mr S.Kh., a resident of Starye Atagi, was questioned as a witness. He stated that in February 2002 there had been an armed clash between the federal troops and insurgents in his village. The federal servicemen had also carried out a special “sweeping” operation, in the course of which his son and the three Nasukhanov brothers and their cousin had been arrested. The detainees had been brought to the mill where the military unit had been stationed. At the request of the local authorities the servicemen had released his son and Vakha Nasukhanov. The two Nasukhanov brothers and their cousin, as well as twelve other residents of Starye Atagi, had not been released and their fate had been unknown. Two or three days later, after the special operation in Mesker-Yurt, Mr S.Kh. had heard that four unidentified dead bodies had been found there. Together with the Nasukhanovs' relatives, Mr S.Kh. had identified three of the bodies as the Nasukhanov brothers and their cousin; the fourth body had not been identified. All the four bodies had been charred and covered in blood but Mr S.Kh. had not seen any firearm wounds on them.\", '53.  On 27 January 2004 the first applicant was granted victim status in case no. 59054 and questioned. He stated that on 14 February 2002 the armed clash between the federal troops and insurgents had commenced in his village. The servicemen had taken away his sons and their cousin, Ruslan Nasukhayev for an identity check. On the evening of 16 February 2002 his son Vakha had been released. On 17 February 2002 he had been told that four dead bodies had been found. On 20 February 2002 the first applicant, together with the second applicant and Mr S.Kh., had seen the burned bodies. The first applicant was only able to identify Movsar and Ruslan by their clothes and shoes. Firearm wounds had been visible on the bodies.', '54.  On 9 February 2004 the investigators questioned Ms N., a sister of Ruslan Nasukhayev, who stated that her brother and his cousins had been arrested and detained in the mill. Later Vakha had been released but Ruslan, Movladi and Movsar had been found dead.', '55.  On 11 February 2004 Mr Sh.Kh., a deputy prosecutor of the town of Argun, was questioned as a witness and stated that on 18 February 2002 he had visited the scene of incident together with an investigating team. They had found two machine guns, which had been dirty and had not been used for a while. There had been gunshot wounds on the bodies. In his opinion, the deaths had occurred some five to ten hours before his arrival.', \"56.  On 15 February 2004 the district prosecutor's office suspended the investigation for failure to identify those responsible.\", \"57.  On 9 March 2006 the district prosecutor's office received a letter from the SRJI; they replied to it on 10 March 2006.\", \"58.  On 16 November 2006 a lawyer requested the district prosecutor's office for access to the investigation file. On 17 November 2006 the request was dismissed.\", \"59.  In the Government's submission, after 15 February 2004 the investigation remained suspended. No decisions to resume or suspend the investigation were taken on 29 April 2005 and 17 November 2006.\", \"60.  On 18 June 2009 the investigating unit of the Investigating Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office for the Chechen Republic (“the investigating unit”) resumed the investigation in case no. 59054.\", '61.  On 1 July 2009 the investigating unit ordered an investigating group to be set up with the participation of civilian and military prosecutors to deal with case no. 59094. The decision read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\\n“At about 9.30 a.m. on 14 February 2002 in the village of Starye Atagi there was a skirmish between unidentified military servicemen and unidentified members of illegal armed groups. After the skirmish the unidentified servicemen kidnapped M. Nasukhanov, born in 1980, M. Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and R. Nasukhanov, born in 1965, from the house at 34 Nuradilov Street.\\nAt about 12 noon on 18 February 2002 (the exact time has not been established by the investigation) the dead bodies of M. Nasukhanov, born in 1980, M. Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and R. Nasukhanov, born in 1965, as well as that of an unidentified man, were found inside a partially constructed house on the north-east outskirts of the village of Mesker-Yurt.\\n... Having studied the case materials, [the investigators] established that sufficient grounds existed to assume that the crime had been committed with the participation of the servicemen of the Russian federal armed forces, which, in particular, is proven by the fact of the skirmish between the servicemen of military unit no. 3179 and unidentified persons.”', '62.  On 9 July 2009 an official of the investigating unit requested his hierarchical superiors to extend the term of the investigation in case no. 59054. The request read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\\n“Between 12 and 19 February 2002 in the village of Starye Atagi of the Groznenskiy District unidentified military servicemen and officers of law-enforcement agencies [who were] using APCs, UAZ and Ural vehicles were carrying out special operations for the identification of members of illegal armed groups. At about 9.30 [a.m.] on 14 February 2002 a shoot out started between unidentified servicemen and unidentified insurgents. After the shooting, unidentified servicemen kidnapped M. Nasukhanov, born in 1980, M. Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and R. Nasukhanov, born in 1965, from the houses at 32 and 34 Nuradilov Street.\\nAt about 12 noon on 18 February 2002 ... the dead bodies of M. Nasukhanov, born in 1980, M. Nasukhanov, born in 1981, and R. Nasukhanov, born in 1965, were discovered in ... Mesker-Yurt.”', \"63.  Despite the Court's request to the Government to submit the entire investigation file in case no. 59054, they failed to do so. They submitted what they described as “the main materials of the investigation file”, sixty‑two pages of copies of documents with inconsistent numeration, among which were the following: the decision to open criminal proceedings; the record of the scene of incident inspection; a statement confirming that Mr M. took four bodies away to bury them; one page of the record of Mr I.'s interview; Mr. M.'s interview record; one page of the interview record of an officer from military unit no. 3179; copies of instructions by the investigators to the police; an order to carry out a ballistics expert examination; a certificate confirming that Mr M. was transporting the bodies of the Nasukhanovs; a certificate issued by the Shali ROVD on 1 April 2002; ballistics expert examination reports; decisions to suspend and resume the investigation; orders to carry out medical expert examinations; a record of Mr S.Kh.'s interview, decisions to grant victim status to the first applicant and Ms N. and their interview records; the death certificates of Movsar and Movladi Nasukhanov; a decision dismissing the request for access to the investigation file; and a decision to compose an investigating group. The Government explained that since the investigation in case no. 54059 was in progress, disclosure of all the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it would run contrary to the interests of the parties to the proceedings.\"], 'applicants': ['NASUKHANOVY'], 'defendants': ['RUSSIA'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['5', '13', '2'], 'violated_articles': ['5', '2', '13'], 'court_assessment_references': {'2': ['30', '44', '45', '47', '51', '53', '59', '61', '62', '71']}, 'silver_rationales': [25, 39, 40, 42, 46, 48, 54, 56, 57], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [25, 39, 40, 42, 46, 48, 54, 56, 57], 'explained_indices': [5, 29, 56, 51, 50, 49, 44, 43, 42, 37, 36, 35, 30, 57, 28, 58, 16, 15, 38, 39, 40, 41, 8, 7, 10, 6, 46, 47, 48, 52, 53, 54, 55, 45, 11, 9, 33, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 34, 23, 24, 22, 26, 27, 14, 13, 12, 31, 32, 25, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4], 'explained_distances': [0.011011332, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290915, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010290913, 0.010089176, 0.00906107, 0.0077859443, 0.0058702584, -0.06414546], 'number_of_sentences': 59, 'article_id': 4, 'fact': 'claimed_and_violated', 'foil': 'claimed_not_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n",

The applicant was born in 1936 and died on 2 April 2009. On 30 April 2009 the applicant’s son and heir, Mr Carlos Kinský, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application originally introduced by his father.', '6. Through more than one hundred civil actions for determination of ownership lodged with Czech courts against the State, local municipalities and third persons, the applicant sought to recover property seized by Czechoslovakia after the Second World War. At that time, the applicant, an eight-year-old child, had allegedly been the owner of the property. During the confiscation his interests had allegedly not been protected by any representative despite the requirements of the law applicable at the time.', '7.  According to the Government, the total value of the property claimed by the applicant was estimated by the police at approximately 50-60 billion Czech korunas (approximately 2-2.4 billion euros).', '8.  On 9 October 2003 the Děčín District Court (okresní soud) dismissed the applicant’s action against the State, represented by the Ministry of the Interior, to determine ownership of certain real estate, finding that the property had been duly confiscated in 1945 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 12/1945. A large volume of archive documents was taken as evidence during the proceedings.', '9.  The applicant appealed, asserting, inter alia, that the District Court had omitted to take certain evidence.', '10.  On 27 January 2005 the Ústí nad Labem Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld the judgment of the court of first instance.', '11.  On 23 November 2005 Section no. 28 of the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud), which is responsible for restitution matters, rent cases and litigations concerning recognition of foreign decisions, dismissed as inadmissible the applicant’s appeal on points of law (dovolání). It found that it had not been conclusively established that the applicant’s property had been duly confiscated, but that in any case the property had been transferred to the State, which had used it since then. Applying its previous case-law, the court held that a property taken by a State before 1990 could not be claimed in civil proceedings but only under the restitution laws.', '12.  On 18 April 2006 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) dismissed the applicant’s constitutional appeal whereby it was contended that he had not had a fair trial and had been discriminated against. The court relied on its stance, enshrined particularly in its opinion no. Pl. ÚS-st. 21/05, according to which a civil action for determination of ownership could not be used to circumvent the restitution legislation, and consequently found that the detailed arguments challenging the merits of the decisions were irrelevant.', '13. On 13 November 2007 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s nullity action (žaloba pro zmatečnost) asserting bias on the part of the District Court judge who had dealt with the civil proceedings. Referring to decision no. II. ÚS 71/06 of the Constitutional Court of 28 February 2006, it held that the activities of certain politicians in creating a negative atmosphere around the applicant’s actions had been unacceptable in a system based on the rule of law. Similarly, it held that the obligation imposed on courts by the Ministry of Justice to report to it on the applicant’s proceedings had been incompatible with the principle of separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches of government. Nevertheless, it did not find that these activities had compromised the impartiality of the particular judge at the Děčín District Court challenged by the applicant.', '14.  At the relevant time various members of the Government and Parliament made public statements commenting on the proceedings instituted by the applicant. The media reported, inter alia, on the following statements.', '15.  The daily newspaper Právo published an article on 26 June 2003 entitled “Dostál [the Minister of Culture] wants to convene a meeting regarding restitutions” about the reaction of politicians to a court decision upholding one of the applicant’s claims. The article quoted Mr Nečas, then an M.P. and vice-president of the second largest party in the Parliament, as saying:\\n“I do not know how we as legislators can do anything about the absolutely insane rulings of judges that suggest that they are independent, but in this instance independent of common sense. Questioning the seizure of property of persons who were demonstrably Nazis simply on the basis of completely formal administrative details, such as that a document from 1946 lacks a stamp or that the stamp is square instead of round, gives rise to misgivings about the train of thought of the judge involved.”', '16.  On 30 June 2003 the weekly newspaper Týden published an interview with the Minister of Culture, Mr Dostál, in which he said, inter alia:\\n“I oppose attempts to return property to active Nazis or their children, as happened in the case of Mr Oldřich Kinský.”', '17.  On 2 July 2003 the website novinky.cz published comments by several politicians regarding another of the applicant’s cases where a court had ruled in his favour. Mr Nečas opined as follows:\\n“I cannot understand what mental processes members of our judicial system could have gone through to reach such conclusions.”', '18.  On 3 July 2003 Právo published another interview with the Minister of Culture, in which he disagreed with the courts’ decisions upholding one of the applicant’s claims:\\n“[I]f other judges decide similarly, then they will have to bear full responsibility for the fact that the State will be obliged to surrender property acquired under the [Presidential] Decrees.”\\nThe minister also mentioned a meeting of politicians and lawyers regarding protection of the Presidential Decrees.', '19.  Several politicians, including the President and the Prime Minister, convened a series of meetings between themselves and lawyers on the issue of civil proceedings for the restitution of property acquired before 1948 in civil proceedings, like those brought by the applicant. According to media reports, the meetings resulted in several options for avoiding such decisions by courts, including requesting the Supreme Court to unify the divergent case-law, issuing new and perfect confiscation orders, adding an amendment to the Civil Code to prohibit actions for the determination of ownership of property acquired by the State before 1990, or amending the Constitution to the same effect.', '20.  On 25 September 2003 Právo reported on a hearing before Děčín District Court in the proceedings that are the subject of the present application. The hearing was also attended by the vice-governor of the Ústí nad Labem Region (místohejtman Ústeckého kraje) and a member of the governing party who said: “I am not here as a politician, but as the son of parents that Nazis deported to a camp. Today a counsel defends a descendant of the Nazis. I will do anything within my power so that these people do not achieve what they want”.', '21.  On 14 December 2003 the weekly newspaper Respekt published an interview with a Member of Parliament and a member of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs who said that the applicant had no right to restitution of any property. When asked whether the resolution of these questions should not be left to independent courts she replied that in her view they had not influenced the courts but that some court decisions had been wrong and that the courts were so independent as to be independent of laws.', '22.  On 12 January 2004 the Ministry of Justice sent letters to the presidents of regional courts asking them to provide it with information on a monthly basis on the developments in the proceedings brought by the applicant. It reasoned that it was requesting the information because of heightened interest of the media in these proceedings.', '23.  The Ústí nad Labem Regional Court, like the other regional courts, complied with this request and regularly forwarded to the Ministry information on the applicant’s proceedings within its region, including reports from the Děčín District Court drawn up by the judge dealing with the actions brought by the applicant. The reports included information about the proceedings which are the subject matter of this application, in which, at that time, appellate proceedings were pending.', '24.  The reports from all the regional courts where proceedings brought by the applicant were being conducted included procedural steps taken in the proceedings, the names of the defendants, the subject matter of the proceedings and the name of the judges dealing with the cases.', '25.  On 8 July 2004 the Ministry informed the Regional Court that it no longer wished to receive the information on a monthly basis, but only once every three months.', '26.  On 7 November 2006 the Ministry informed the regional courts that it was no longer necessary to provide this information.', '27.  In 2004, by order of a deputy of the Police President, the police set up a special investigative team code-named “Property” for the purpose of carrying out tasks relating to the examination of a suspicion of unlawful surrender of the Czech Republic’s property to natural or legal persons. The team’s activities consisted of a comprehensive examination of the suspicion that such criminal acts (which in their view could lead to pecuniary loss amounting to tens of billions of Czech crowns) had been committed.', '28.  On 10 March 2004 the police started investigating the applicant and his counsel on suspicion of fraud. The police contended that the investigation was justified by the applicant’s attempts to fraudulently claim in civil proceedings assets confiscated in 1945 under the Presidential Decrees as enemy property. They suspected that in the course of the civil proceedings the applicant had intentionally withheld relevant facts in order to support his action.', '29.  On an unspecified date in the course of the investigation, the police sent requests to the Děčín District Court and the competent department of the Ministry of the Interior for the purpose of quantifying the total value of the property claimed by the applicant and obtaining the applicant’s submissions and decisions of the court in his case. Both authorities complied with the requests.', '30.  On 27 April 2004 the Praha-východ District Court, at the request of the police, ordered the production of the records of two phone lines belonging to the applicant’s counsel from 26 January 2004 to 26 April 2004. According to the Government, only information on the telecommunications activity, namely, the times of calls, the numbers of incoming and outgoing calls, and approximate mobile phone locations was produced; the content of the telephone conversations was neither recorded nor intercepted.', '31.  In a letter of 26 July 2004 the Deputy Director of the Office for Foreign Relations and Information (Úřad pro zahraniční styky a informace), a Czech intelligence service, in reply to a request for cooperation, informed the police unit in charge of the investigation about the system of administration of church registers in Austria and ways of accessing them in order to locate the applicant’s birth certificate. Having found that access to the registers was restricted, the Deputy Director considered and rejected the possibility of using secret agents to acquire the documents in question and advised the police unit on how the State should proceed in the civil proceedings against the applicant, recommending that they manoeuvre the applicant into a situation where he would himself be obliged to establish his Czech citizenship.', '32.  On 28 April 2006 the police suspended the investigation, stating that in civil proceedings the applicant was not obliged by the Code of Civil Procedure to disclose all relevant facts, but only those supporting his claims. They also stated that the applicant’s counsel had not breached his duty under Article 101 § 1 of the Code to assert all important facts, because he was not obliged to assert facts favouring the opposing party. Thus, according to that decision, the applicant could not be regarded as having intentionally withheld certain information in a fraudulent attempt to recover the property by misleading the courts.', '33.  It appears from the decision that during their investigation the police tracked down enquiries the applicant’s counsel had made with a number of archives and state institutions in order to find documents relevant for the civil proceedings. When questioning employees of those institutions, the police also noted the areas of interest of the applicant’s counsel and the documents to which he had had access and had studied. The decision further shows that the investigation enabled the police to make a qualified assessment of the evidence which the applicant might use as the plaintiff in the civil proceedings against the State.', '34.  On 8 June 2006 the applicant and his counsel found out by chance that they had been under police investigation. Neither of them had ever been questioned during the investigation.', '35.  On 5 December 2006 the applicant’s counsel lodged a constitutional appeal with the Constitutional Court. Invoking the right to confidentiality of communications with his client, he challenged the production of the records of his telephone communications as contrary to his right to respect for the confidentiality of telephone communications under Article 13 of the Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. He requested that the order of the Praha-východ District Court of 27 April 2004 be quashed, the police case file disclosed and the records destroyed.', '36.  On 27 September 2007 the Constitutional Court allowed the appeal and quashed the order as unlawful, ordering the police to destroy all the records of the telephone communications. The court found:\\n“... the State has the standing of defendant in a set of civil proceedings initiated by a client of the complainant [that is, the applicant]. It litigates with the claimant on an equal footing in such proceedings. To defend its interests there, it is equipped with staff and finances from the State budget. If criminal proceedings are brought simultaneously with these [civil] proceedings ... despite the fact that a reasonable suspicion of a crime, which is one of the legal requirements for the initiation of any criminal proceedings, does not exist, there is a logical presumption that the State may at least attempt to improve its legal position in the civil proceedings by acquiring information through the prosecuting authorities and its other security agencies, or even attempt to deter the other litigant. Such conduct by the State is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society and deserves to be condemned ... Although the criminal proceedings were finally rightfully suspended in the instant case, it remains alarming for the democratic development of the country that the suspension took place only after massive, and probably extremely expensive and entirely superfluous, criminal proceedings which should have never been initiated.\\n...\\n... the police decision to suspend the investigation was based on a purely legal conclusion that could have been arrived at without evidence consisting of 4,384 pages ... including materials procured by means of legal assistance provided by third countries and information supplied by the intelligence service ... The police ... and the supervising prosecutor ... could have arrived at the same conclusion at the outset [of the investigation].”'], 'applicants': ['KINSKÝ'], 'defendants': ['CZECH REPUBLIC'], 'allegedly_violated_articles': ['6'], 'violated_articles': ['6'], 'court_assessment_references': {'6': ['18', '36', '51'], '41': ['112', '113']}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 31], 'gold_rationales': []}, 'silver_rationales': [13, 31], 'explained_indices': [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 0, 7, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 26, 27, 20, 29, 25, 19, 15, 17, 16, 30, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 18, 31], 'explained_distances': [0.19039452, 0.14888227, 0.09812391, 0.08898008, 0.058849096, 0.0358302, 0.0036646128, -0.020347714, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673, -0.023459673], 'number_of_sentences': 32, 'article_id': 3, 'fact': 'not_claimed', 'foil': 'claimed_and_violated', 'gold': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0'), 'predicted': tensor([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]], device='cuda:0')}\n"
